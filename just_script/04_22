<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, guess who&#39;s dropping Jackie off here after cheerleading practice? Leslie Cannon.
 <br>
 Ah, Leslie Cannon.
 <br>
 Nickname: The Cannon.
 <br>
 Why? Because she always shoots Eric down.
 <br>
 Man, you were so in love with her.
 <br>
 Remember in the seventh grade when she asked you your name and you got all panicky and said, &#34;Uh-bluh&#34;? Yeah, and then she called you &#34;Uh-bluh&#34; for, like, the next two years.
 <br>
 That was awesome.
 <br>
 I still don&#39;t see why we have to spend the night.
 <br>
 It only took me 30 minutes to get caught up with everyone at my high school reunion.
 <br>
 Oh, well, standing in the corner muttering &#34;dumb-ass&#34; at everyone doesn&#39;t count as getting caught up.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait to see some dear, old girlfriends.
 <br>
 Like the Miller twins.
 <br>
 God, I hope they&#39;re fat.
 <br>
 Oh, crap.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no way that all these bags are gonna fit in here.
 <br>
 Oh, geez, I was really looking forward to taking this baby out on the highway.
 <br>
 Well, we&#39;ll just have to take two cars.
 <br>
 No, we&#39;ll take the Toyota.
 <br>
 I can bring another dress.
 <br>
 Shows a little more leg so Stuart McDaniel can see what he missed out on.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, you guys.
 <br>
 Here comes Leslie.
 <br>
 Hey, how&#39;s my hair? It&#39;s a little messy.
 <br>
 Hey, it&#39;s Uh-bluh! Yeah, um, I&#39;m going by Eric now.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t care what your name is, Eric.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a cheerleader.
 <br>
 Wow, this car is so hot! Yeah, that&#39;s kind of like what I was thinking.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause I was thinking she was hot.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, mama.
 <br>
 So, uh, whose car is this? Oh, uh, it&#39;s my dad&#39;s tough luck that it&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 So, what kind of engine is in this thing? Oh, well, it&#39;s, uh it&#39;s a multi-piston That&#39;s, uh, twice as powerful as the the 100.
 <br>
 You know what? I think you should take me for a drive tonight.
 <br>
 Are you talking to me? Yeah No Sure.
 <br>
 Yeah No Shut up.
 <br>
 Yes, it&#39;s my car.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 - Pick me up at 7:00.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 What have I done? Well, you&#39;re using your dad&#39;s dream car to get with a totally hot chick who would otherwise never date you.
 <br>
 When you put it like that, it just sounds right.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s the keys to the Corvette.
 <br>
 But the only reason I&#39;m giving them to you is so you can move it in case there&#39;s a fire.
 <br>
 And because you trust me.
 <br>
 Right! Now, you know that I&#39;ll know if the Corvette&#39;s been moved.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve noted its exact position in the garage the angle of the wheels and I just might have set a few booby traps.
 <br>
 I am so lucky to have a daddy who cares enough to set booby traps.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Okay, I get it.
 <br>
 The only way I get to drive the Corvette is if there&#39;s a fire.
 <br>
 But to the end of the driveway.
 <br>
 No further.
 <br>
 A fire is no excuse for a joyride.
 <br>
 Michael, what are you doing in Casey&#39;s room? Spittin&#39; in his socks.
 <br>
 What are you doing? We came by to say hi to Casey.
 <br>
 Watching you spit is just a super bonus.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, your lover&#39;s out of town.
 <br>
 And I asked your lover where he was going and your lover said, &#34;Neptune,&#34; and that he&#39;d be back tomorrow.
 <br>
 And then your lover punched me in the head and laughed.
 <br>
 But we&#39;ll see who&#39;s laughing when he puts on his socks and gets his feet all spitty.
 <br>
 Ha! Casey&#39;s out of town? He never tells me anything.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like the only thing I know about him is that he&#39;s Kelso&#39;s brother.
 <br>
 Well, you know he subscribes to Van Aficionado.
 <br>
 Stop snooping, Jackie.
 <br>
 But, Donna, you know, say this pile of stuff was to get accidentally knocked over.
 <br>
 Oh, no! And while picking it up, you just happen to look through it.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m not gonna snoop.
 <br>
 Oh, look! He took a quiz.
 <br>
 &#34;Your Ideal Chick: Van Fan or Biker Liker?&#34; But you know what? You wouldn&#39;t care what kind of girl he likes.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re only dating him.
 <br>
 Oh, no! Forman, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re actually gonna take out Red&#39;s Corvette.
 <br>
 Yeah, and I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re wearing brown shoes with a black belt.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just tacky.
 <br>
 Guys, the odometer&#39;s busted.
 <br>
 The odometer&#39;s busted! That&#39;s a sign from God.
 <br>
 God loves me.
 <br>
 He wants me to steal the car.
 <br>
 Besides, I think I&#39;ve learned most of Red&#39;s tricks now like this one: The old &#34;strand of hair across the ignition&#34; trap.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re a regular Green Beret, Forman.
 <br>
 Oh, please.
 <br>
 With that outfit, a green beret is the last thing he needs.
 <br>
 Well, here we are in my Corvette enjoying the open road and the delightful, pine-fresh scent of your hair.
 <br>
 That&#39;s your cheapo air freshener.
 <br>
 - Yuck.
 <br>
 - No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Can I drive? Uh, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Uh-bluh.
 <br>
 Okay, now, if the Miller twins are fat, be nice.
 <br>
 But if they&#39;re still thin, I don&#39;t want to hear any &#34;hubba-hubbas&#34; or remarks about doubling your pleasure.
 <br>
 Remember, it&#39;s my reunion.
 <br>
 I am the prettiest one here.
 <br>
 Well, you are the prettiest one here.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 The invitation says the 29th.
 <br>
 Kitty, that says the 23rd.
 <br>
 I have been telling you for months that you need glasses.
 <br>
 You know, one of these days, you&#39;re gonna wander off and fall into a hole.
 <br>
 What hole? Where are these holes? They&#39;re everywhere.
 <br>
 You just can&#39;t see &#39;em, &#39;cause you need glasses.
 <br>
 Well, we spent three hours in Casey&#39;s room and all we found out is that he collects mud flaps.
 <br>
 Yeah, but all that snooping gave me such a rush.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s go to the mall and shoplift some lip gloss.
 <br>
 No thanks, little felon.
 <br>
 I feel guilty enough.
 <br>
 Besides, I have to finish my chemistry homework.
 <br>
 Oh, no! I left my chemistry book on Casey&#39;s desk, and he comes back tomorrow! So we&#39;ll just go back and get it.
 <br>
 Jackie, I already went over there all, &#34;Where&#39;s Casey?&#34; Now if I go back all, &#34;Where&#39;s my book&#34; But you are all, &#34;Where&#39;s my book?&#34; But Kelso won&#39;t believe that, and then he&#39;ll think I&#39;m a goob and then he&#39;ll tell Casey that I&#39;m a goob! Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, look.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll wait till later tonight, then sneak back in and get it.
 <br>
 Besides, Casey&#39;s got this really great clock radio I really want.
 <br>
 Oh, Kitty, don&#39;t tell Eric that we&#39;re coming home.
 <br>
 If he&#39;s doing something wrong and we both know he is it&#39;s important that I catch him.
 <br>
 - Why? - Because it gives me pleasure.
 <br>
 - There&#39;s the three.
 <br>
 - Shut it! I&#39;m Red, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Where are my muffins, dumb-ass? Forman residence.
 <br>
 Dr.
 <br>
 Hook speaking.
 <br>
 Who is it, dumb-ass? Steven, honey, it&#39;s Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Oh, hey, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman? Um, there&#39;s been some sort of sort of little mistake.
 <br>
 I finished my homework.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s move on to Bible study! It seems like my reunion was last week.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 You were really looking forward to seeing them fat twins, right? So, we&#39;re coming home tonight.
 <br>
 Tell Eric, okay? It&#39;s important.
 <br>
 Yeah, of course.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Bye, sweetie.
 <br>
 They&#39;re coming home early.
 <br>
 You know what this means? - Yeah, we have to hurry up and find Eric.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 We have to hurry up and finish the rest of Red&#39;s beer.
 <br>
 Hopefully, Forman&#39;ll get blamed for that too.
 <br>
 Boy, this is fun, but I think race time is over now! Good, we&#39;re slowing down.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 A little motion sickness going on.
 <br>
 But, uh, the car&#39;s all in one piece, so I&#39;m on top of the world.
 <br>
 What was that? That was me falling off the top of the world.
 <br>
 Well, the good news is, I found the hubcap in a huge field of mud.
 <br>
 And the other good news is, in about a hundred years some archaeologist is gonna be thrilled to find my shoes.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you know Look, there aren&#39;t any scratches or dents.
 <br>
 So, just dirt.
 <br>
 I-I think I&#39;m in the clear.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m starting to think I might like you.
 <br>
 - Really? - I&#39;m not sure though.
 <br>
 I think I have to drive the car some more.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m starting to think I might let you drive the car.
 <br>
 - Really? - I&#39;m not sure though.
 <br>
 I think we might have to make out some more.
 <br>
 - Okay, I got it.
 <br>
 - Okay, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Jackie? Donna? Am I dreaming? Uh, yes.
 <br>
 - Yes, you are.
 <br>
 - Are we gonna do it? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, Michael, we are.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Donna first.
 <br>
 So you smooched the Cannon.
 <br>
 How was her tongue? Was it nimble? Like a belly dancer.
 <br>
 And at one point I was touching a spot not four inches from boob.
 <br>
 Not bad, Forman.
 <br>
 Not only did you get within shouting distance of second base you successfully snaked Red&#39;s Corvette.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I gotta wash it, wax it and put on a hubcap, but that should only take about an hour.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna do it in the morning.
 <br>
 - Perfect.
 <br>
 Sleep tight.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Oh, by the way, um, your parents called a couple hours ago.
 <br>
 - They&#39;ll be home in 40 minutes.
 <br>
 - What? Relax, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just messing with you.
 <br>
 They&#39;ll be home in 20 minutes.
 <br>
 Okay, tire location, check.
 <br>
 Seat placement, check.
 <br>
 Picture of Fez&#39;s butt, check.
 <br>
 That one&#39;s going on my desk.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, there&#39;s just one more thing: The strand of hair over the ignition.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re gonna get away with it.
 <br>
 What a bunch of crap.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, they&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Damn it! The air freshener! Damn it, you remembered.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s the Corvette, safe and sound.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just saying that for your benefit, in case you can&#39;t see it.
 <br>
 Well, I am so glad you raced all the way home without stopping for this.
 <br>
 Cripes, I gotta pee like a banshee.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m off to the candy shop.
 <br>
 My Everlasting Gobstopper just crapped out on me.
 <br>
 Fez, I was sleeping in Casey&#39;s room and I think somehow I had one of his dreams, &#39;cause I did it with Hey, guys.
 <br>
 No, no, Michael.
 <br>
 Finish your sentence.
 <br>
 You did it with A hat on? A-And you.
 <br>
 You, me and a hat.
 <br>
 It was hot.
 <br>
 Of course it was.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s better with a hat.
 <br>
 Come on, fellas.
 <br>
 Put a hat on.
 <br>
 The lady deserves it.
 <br>
 What were you doing in Casey&#39;s bed anyway? Oh, when he&#39;s out of town, I like to skank it up by skipping a couple showers and sleeping in it naked.
 <br>
 Michael, tell me more about this dream.
 <br>
 Was anyone else there? Jackie, why would I have a sexy dream with anyone besides you? Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Hey, your old man wants to talk to you outside.
 <br>
 - Why? Am I busted? - Don&#39;t worry, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not about the car.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 - Oh, Forman, I almost forgot.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about the car.
 <br>
 You gotta stop doing that, man! Um, you wanted to see me? Did you take my car out last night? No.
 <br>
 I know you didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Guess how I know! I stuck a hair across the ignition.
 <br>
 A hair acro You know, someday I&#39;m gonna use that on my son.
 <br>
 Anyway, since I know I can trust you, I&#39;m gonna let you drive it.
 <br>
 I finally get to drive it? Wow! Okay, uh, where does the key go? - Start her up.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m grounded.
 <br>
 For a month! Why did you do it? To impress this cheerleader.
 <br>
 No kidding? Well, then make it two weeks.
 <br>
 So, uh, you gonna see her again? Well, can I have the car again? Ohh, she&#39;s that girl.
 <br>
 I know that girl.
 <br>
 Stay away from that girl.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman, your mom wants to talk to you.
 <br>
 She wants to know why you drank all of Red&#39;s beer.
 <br>
 You know what? Let&#39;s just call it a month.
 <br>
 - Michael.
 <br>
 - Jackie? - Am I dreaming? - Yes, you are.
 <br>
 Are we gonna do it? - Yes, we are.
 <br>
 - Oh, cool.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Donna? What?
 <br>
