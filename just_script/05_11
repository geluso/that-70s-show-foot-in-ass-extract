 Why would Sports Illustrated even publish an issue that&#39;s not a swimsuit issue? You know who should do a swimsuit issue? Playboy.
 <br>
 Why would you put clothes on a centerfold? Sometimes I get tired of all the complete nakedness and I like to be teased a little.
 <br>
 Yeah, there&#39;s a lot more going on up here than you know about.
 <br>
 I think there&#39;s some stuff going on in there that you don&#39;t know about.
 <br>
 You guys should have come to the arboretum with us.
 <br>
 We saw plants and trees from all over the world.
 <br>
 There was a bush from Morocco.
 <br>
 Smelled like chocolate chip cookies.
 <br>
 Ah, that is the perfect bush.
 <br>
 Thanks for taking me to the arboretum.
 <br>
 It was fun.
 <br>
 Yeah, what a great day.
 <br>
 What a horrible day! I don&#39;t mind looking at some trees, okay? When they put little signs on them, with little Latin names- It makes me want to harm myself.
 <br>
 - So the missus took you out for some girl fun, huh? - ( Clicks On ) See, Donna is hot, but she is mean.
 <br>
 My girlfriend Nina? Just hot.
 <br>
 You know, Fez, you talk a lot about this Nina chick, but none of us have ever seen her.
 <br>
 Yeah, we&#39;re actually starting to suspect that she is some creepy alter-ego you visit late at night in front of the mirror.
 <br>
 Oh, no, I don&#39;t do that anymore.
 <br>
 But Nina is the real deal.
 <br>
 Kelso saw her at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Uh, there were a lot of girls there.
 <br>
 She could have been the one with the lazy eye that does the vision test.
 <br>
 Lazy-eye Lizzie? No way.
 <br>
 She wouldn&#39;t even look at me.
 <br>
 Nina, my friends don&#39;t believe that you&#39;re my girlfriend, even though I Frenched you.
 <br>
 Girlfriend? I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re there yet.
 <br>
 I mean, I like you and all, it&#39;s just that all the guys at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 seem great until you find them in your apartment wearing your hot curlers.
 <br>
 Warren.
 <br>
 I want to get to know you better, meet your friends make sure they&#39;re not puppets.
 <br>
 Warren.
 <br>
 So, if they are not puppets, then would you be my girlfriend? Mmm, it would definitely help.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) - Are these lines open or not? - Oh, you&#39;re right, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - That was very unprofessional.
 <br>
 ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) So, we&#39;re finally gonna meet the mysterious and possibly fictional Nina! Fictional? Does this hickey look fictional? Huh, looks too small to be from the vacuum cleaner, like last time.
 <br>
 Wait, let me see.
 <br>
 Small, blotchy and uneven.
 <br>
 Ah, this girl&#39;s an amateur.
 <br>
 Let me see.
 <br>
 Small, blotchy and unpleasant.
 <br>
 Yeah, this girl&#39;s a Jackie.
 <br>
 Well, Fez, I am thrilled that you found a girl &#39;cause I was startin&#39; to worry.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) But you&#39;ve proven me and the experts from Reader&#39;s Digest wrong! When I introduce her to everybody, I just want it to be special.
 <br>
 Oh! Let&#39;s have a formal dinner party tomorrow.
 <br>
 You know, it was at a dinner party that I first realized Red Forman was more than just a boy with great hair.
 <br>
 Sounds good, Miss Kitty.
 <br>
 You might be a little past your prime, but your mind is still sharp.
 <br>
 Oh, actually tomorrow night&#39;s not gonna work I thought we might go see Laser Floyd.
 <br>
 Well, you tell this fellow Floyd that you have a dinner party.
 <br>
 No, Mom, Laser Floyd&#39;s not a guy Laser Floyd is Pink Floyd music- with lasers! Lasers, like in Star Wars.
 <br>
 ! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, we&#39;ll be here.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 You&#39;d rather go to a formal dinner party? Sure! Sounds great.
 <br>
 And, uh, don&#39;t forget, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 You can count Steven and me in.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ve been looking for an excuse to buy him a shirt with buttons.
 <br>
 Since it&#39;s a special occasion, you&#39;re all allowed one sip of wine.
 <br>
 Great! It&#39;ll be like Communion, but without the fun of church.
 <br>
 So, Steven, you know, I was thinking of getting you a pair of beige corduroys and maybe a blue blazer for the party.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t forget the matching scarf and gloves.
 <br>
 This way, I&#39;ll be nice and toasty when hell freezes over.
 <br>
 Uh-oh,Jackie.
 <br>
 Looks like Steven doesn&#39;t wanna wear his big-boy clothes.
 <br>
 No, I don&#39;t wanna go.
 <br>
 You should have asked me before you said I would.
 <br>
 Steven! I am your girlfriend.
 <br>
 I speak for you now! Well, then, tell yourself I said to bite me, &#39;cause I&#39;m not going.
 <br>
 Oh, you are so going! So just bite yourself!.
 <br>
 - ( Door Slams ) - Man, do you believe that crap? Tell me about it.
 <br>
 Donna wants to go to a dinner party, we go to a dinner party.
 <br>
 If she wants to go to the arboretum, bang, I&#39;m in a room full of trees.
 <br>
 God, I hate trees.
 <br>
 So tall and arrogant.
 <br>
 So why don&#39;t you just not go? - Oh, it&#39;s just one day.
 <br>
 - Not for you, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re engaged.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Latin for &#39;&#39;screwed for life.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, my God, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 And I have no choice.
 <br>
 I have to do what she says or she won&#39;t let me touch her naughty places.
 <br>
 - Hyde, this is extortion! - You&#39;re tellin&#39; me? I&#39;m bein&#39; shaken down by a 95-pound brunette with pink toenails.
 <br>
 Kitty? I know this change of life has upset you but we just bought wine the other day.
 <br>
 What are you doing, brushin&#39; your teeth with the stuff? Red, it&#39;s not for me.
 <br>
 Well, this one is.
 <br>
 We&#39;re having a dinner party tomorrow night.
 <br>
 No, can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 Battle of the Network Stars is on! See, once a year, they make TV stars compete at things they&#39;re not good at.
 <br>
 I look forward all season to watching Ed Asner try to paddle a canoe.
 <br>
 Makes me feel superior.
 <br>
 Well, you shouldn&#39;t feel superior, because you know what I know about Ed Asner? Ed Asner would come to my dinner party, &#39;cause he knows how to treat a woman.
 <br>
 Did you say &#39;&#39;dinner party&#39;&#39;? ( Chuckles ) See, I thought you- Oh, screw it, I&#39;ll be there.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this about a party? Oh, well, we&#39;re having a party tomorrow night for Fez and Nina.
 <br>
 - I invited all the kids.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m a kid.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s for couples only.
 <br>
 You can come if you bring a date.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s too late to find a date.
 <br>
 I mean- Yeah, I&#39;m sweet looking, but I&#39;m no miracle worker.
 <br>
 Well, maybe if you stop jumping from girl to girl, you wouldn&#39;t be alone.
 <br>
 You&#39;re no Frank Sinatra, you know! You know, you used to be nice, but you&#39;ve changed, lady! Guys, I really want Nina to like me so please, avoid the following topics: my addiction to candy the fact that I have needs and my use of Alberto VO5 Hot Oil Treatment.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Fez, what does she care what you use on your hair? Oh, I do not use it on my hair.
 <br>
 Well, heard about your secret couples party.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not goin&#39;, &#39;cause I hate parties.
 <br>
 Hey, man, I&#39;m only goin&#39; &#39;cause Donna&#39;s makin&#39; me.
 <br>
 At this rate, the only way I&#39;ll see Laser Floyd is if they project it on a leaf canopy at the arboretum.
 <br>
 So, don&#39;t go to the party.
 <br>
 Act tough, Forman.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not tough.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s why I said &#39;&#39;act.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; No one&#39;s making me go, that&#39;s for sure.
 <br>
 Oh, that is it, Steven.
 <br>
 As your girlfriend, I am ordering you to go to this party.
 <br>
 And as your boyfriend, I&#39;m ordering you to take your bossy mouth and flap it elsewhere.
 <br>
 If you flap it at me, I&#39;ll go with you.
 <br>
 You hear that, Steven? Michael wants to go to the party with me.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not going to the party.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Michael, I would love to go to the party with you.
 <br>
 Kick-ass! I love parties! Okay, now.
 <br>
 These are called after-dinner conversation cards.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s try one! ( Laughs ) &#39;&#39;If you were a bird, where would you fly?&#39;&#39; Donna? Um, south? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m nervous.
 <br>
 I feel like I&#39;m on Jeopardy.
 <br>
 If I were a bird, I&#39;d fly to Laser Floyd.
 <br>
 I&#39;d fly to Tahiti, &#39;cause the girls there don&#39;t wear tops! Wait, but then I&#39;d want to change back to myself because no lady wants to make it with a bird.
 <br>
 Wait, can I be a monkey? Okay.
 <br>
 Nina! I&#39;d fly to my favorite place, the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 ! I was just going to say that! Red, we haven&#39;t heard a peep out of you.
 <br>
 If I was a bird, I&#39;d fly into a ceiling fan.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Steven, you came, just like I thought you would.
 <br>
 - You buckled! - No, I got hungry.
 <br>
 You&#39;re in my seat.
 <br>
 Damn, Hyde, now everyone knows it&#39;s a clip-on! Since you two work at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 how about you make this parking ticket disappear? We can&#39;t fix this.
 <br>
 You parked in a fire lane.
 <br>
 Oh, Nina, please.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) We&#39;re his guests.
 <br>
 I will take care of it, little buddy.
 <br>
 - No, Fez, he broke the law.
 <br>
 - Broke the law? - I was just getting some milk.
 <br>
 - What if there was a fire? Then I&#39;d pour my milk on it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s try another card.
 <br>
 Um, &#39;&#39;If you could be anyone&#39;s shoe whose shoe would you be?&#39;&#39; I wouldn&#39;t want to be Red&#39;s shoe, &#39;cause I think it&#39;s about to go in someone&#39;s ass.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it! I&#39;m watching Battle of the Network Stars.
 <br>
 I&#39;m with you.
 <br>
 Have fun with Mr.
 <br>
 Clip-on.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know what? Me too.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re leaving? - There are lasers going off right now! Perfectly synchronized lasers! And all of a sudden, you&#39;re, like- like, Lady Dinner Rolls shaking me down with her naughty places! I&#39;m going too.
 <br>
 Apparently we can eat a man&#39;s food, but we cannot fix his ticket! Well, what happened to my dinner party? I&#39;m sorry, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, but Marilu Henner only gets on the trampoline once a year and I&#39;m not gonna miss it.
 <br>
 Where the hell does Eric get off acting like I make him do stuff? It not like I wanted us to come to this dinner party either! I only did because well, you&#39;re all menopause-y now, and you scare me! Right, you came for me.
 <br>
 Just like I slaved over a pot roast for all of you.
 <br>
 You want a definition of Hell? Try opening a 400-degree oven while you&#39;re having a hot flash.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all here for someone else.
 <br>
 And you know why? It&#39;s right there in front of us, girls.
 <br>
 - Women are giving.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not giving! I&#39;m here for me.
 <br>
 Steven is the one who should think about others.
 <br>
 - I mean, how could he just ditch me? - Well,Jackie it might have to do with trying to boss him around - then showing up with Kelso.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I know she&#39;s right.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re not a part of the group, and I don&#39;t like you, so zip it! ( Cheering On TV) Man, look at you guys, all forced to hide in the basement because of your women.
 <br>
 ( Eric ) Hey.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not hiding from anyone.
 <br>
 I finally set Donna straight.
 <br>
 Alls you did was babble about lasers and naughty places.
 <br>
 Man, I thought you were having a stroke.
 <br>
 Whatever, man.
 <br>
 You caved just likeJackie wanted.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t cave.
 <br>
 Just wanted to make sure &#39;&#39;Don Juan el Tardo&#39;&#39; here kept his hands off her.
 <br>
 Then how do you explain the necktie? I just came from a business meeting.
 <br>
 At least he&#39;s putting up a fight.
 <br>
 You just gave up.
 <br>
 Like France.
 <br>
 Oh, get off his back, little buddy.
 <br>
 You were at the party too.
 <br>
 Hey, I fought the good fight for 30 years.
 <br>
 Now I just agree with what Kitty wants to do, so I can go to sleep.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not your &#39;&#39;little buddy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yeah, you&#39;re all doomed.
 <br>
 That&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 No, we&#39;re not all doomed.
 <br>
 One man here still has a chance.
 <br>
 One man can take a stand for all of us.
 <br>
 And that man&#39;s name is- Well, we can&#39;t pronounce his real name, so we call him Fez! I don&#39;t want to take a stand, I just want Nina to be my girlfriend and give me nooky! Fez, come on.
 <br>
 Give it a try! It&#39;ll be like Battle of the Network Stars.
 <br>
 Think about it.
 <br>
 Welcome back to the Battle of the Gender Stars - where it&#39;s the gals with 50 points! - ( Cheering ) And the guys with zero.
 <br>
 But the guys still have a chance &#39;cause the final event is conveniently worth 51 points.
 <br>
 You guys are pathetic! Wow, that&#39;s some tough talk,Jamie Farr.
 <br>
 I&#39;m switching to the gals&#39; team.
 <br>
 I can do that, because I wear a dress on M.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 H.
 <br>
 Okay, now let&#39;s meet our contestants.
 <br>
 - Representing the gals: the lovely Nina! - ( Women Cheering ) - And representing the guys: the lovely Fez! - ( Eric ) Yes.
 <br>
 Fighters, go! ( Blows Whistle ) ( Red ) Make that dame eat some mud! Oh, I forgot to tell you.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going antiquing all weekend! Oh, like hell we are.
 <br>
 ( Cheering ) I hate antiquing.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do this thing! That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Gentlemen, let&#39;s go get our cojones back! I gotta see this.
 <br>
 - Hey, man, you coming? - Nah, I still have my cojones.
 <br>
 My lonely, lonely cojones.
 <br>
 Oh, look who it is.
 <br>
 You bake a brownie, and the bastards come running.
 <br>
 I&#39;m afraid your brownies are powerless now.
 <br>
 Fez has something to say.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 - Can I have a brownie? - Fez! Oh.
 <br>
 Right, right, right, right.
 <br>
 Nina, I insist you take care of Red&#39;s ticket, because I am in charge.
 <br>
 - Yeah, it&#39;s not gonna happen.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - Man, what the hell? - I have needs.
 <br>
 Nina, if I do everything you want, would you be my girlfriend? Can&#39;t say no to that! ( Chuckles ) I cannot believe it! I have a girlfriend! So when do we do it? - I am not speaking to you.
 <br>
 - ( Sets Down Dinnerware ) Well, at least it will be quiet enough to go to sleep.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna, when we came up here, Fez was supposed to- Donna? Oh, crap.
 <br>
 Hey, Steven, look.
 <br>
 Remember how you said that I was bossy? Well, I think you were right.
 <br>
 So, from now on, if I want you to do something, I&#39;ll ask first.
 <br>
 - Well, I just- - Shh, I&#39;m talking! ( Gasps ) I am so sorry.
 <br>
 There I go again.
 <br>
 Okay, here&#39;s what I wanted to say: Would you like to go with me to the Girl Scout Alumni Pancake Breakfast? Jackie, I&#39;d rather put on a dress and slow dance with Kelso on Soul Train.
 <br>
 But since you asked nicely, I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 Yea! Oh, uh, Steven, don&#39;t forget to bring a spatula because I signed you up as a flipper.
 <br>
 Hey, the flipper better be the guy who judges the Alumni Bikini Contest! It&#39;s not.
 <br>
 - Donna- - Wait, let me guess.
 <br>
 - ( Door Closes ) - Laser Floyd, Laser Floyd arboretum, dinner roll, Laser Floyd.
 <br>
 - Okay, listen.
 <br>
 - No, you listen.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with you- if it&#39;s genetic, or if you took a pill from your mother&#39;s cabinet- But I&#39;m through doing stuff for you, because you don&#39;t appreciate it.
 <br>
 Whoa, whoa, wait.
 <br>
 You&#39;re doing stuff for me? Yeah! I went to that dinner party to make your mother happy and I went to the arboretum because you wanted to.
 <br>
 I wanted to? All I said was, &#39;&#39;Look, the arboretum.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; W- It sounded like you wanted to go.
 <br>
 I hate trees! I mean, &#39;&#39;Ooh, show me trees!&#39;&#39; Does that sound like me? - No.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - ( Sighs ) I just- I thought you were gonna make me do girlie crap for the rest of my life.
 <br>
 Eric, come on.
 <br>
 You know me way better than that.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 So, would you like to go see Laser Floyd next weekend? Oh, we can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I signed us up for this class: &#39;&#39;Quilting for Couples.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughing ) - ( Chuckling ) I&#39;m kidding! - ( Gasps ) It&#39;s just for men.
 <br>
 And the canoeing champion for this year&#39;s Battle of the Network Stars is Red Forman! - My team! - Thanks,Jamie Farr.
 <br>
 And I&#39;d like to give a special thanks to Ed Asner.
 <br>
 Ed, thanks for paddling your canoe like a girl.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your spunk now, you big pansy? ( Laughing )
