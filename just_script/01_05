 I just want to hear the guitar solo one more time.
 <br>
 Not again.
 <br>
 Use the headphones.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Now, wrap the cord around your neck.
 <br>
 Would you guys respect me if I worked in the town dump? The town dump? No.
 <br>
 Now, the state dump Why are you looking for a job? Everything costs money.
 <br>
 Gas, clothes fun.
 <br>
 - Dates.
 <br>
 Dates cost money.
 <br>
 - No, Kelso, that is prostitution.
 <br>
 Dating is prostitution, man.
 <br>
 Only you don&#39;t always get what you pay for.
 <br>
 Said the man who&#39;s never had a girlfriend.
 <br>
 What, you guys don&#39;t remember Esther, the biker chick? - Whatever happened to her? - She&#39;s dating my uncle.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going home for dinner.
 <br>
 By the way, Mom and Dad are going to the Playboy Club at Lake Geneva this weekend.
 <br>
 Do you guys want souvenirs? - Ash trays.
 <br>
 - A woman.
 <br>
 Your parents are going to be out of town? - Really? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;ll be babysitting my sister Tina all weekend.
 <br>
 Just me.
 <br>
 Alone.
 <br>
 Watching TV.
 <br>
 I might order a pizza.
 <br>
 I got an idea! We&#39;ll have a party at Donna&#39;s.
 <br>
 A toga party! Michael! Maybe Donna doesn&#39;t want to throw a party.
 <br>
 - Maybe she wants to be alone.
 <br>
 - Yeah, just me, alone.
 <br>
 If someone happens to stop by, that&#39;d be pretty cool.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re on.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll bring the beer! Donna, I have never been to an American party.
 <br>
 May I come? Yeah, I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 So, Eric, are you gonna be there? - What? Yeah.
 <br>
 Sounds fun.
 <br>
 - Cool.
 <br>
 Catch you guys later.
 <br>
 Party at Donna&#39;s.
 <br>
 You are both so stupid.
 <br>
 Why? This is a first.
 <br>
 I actually agree with Jackie.
 <br>
 What? You&#39;re saying that I&#39;m stupid? Donna just put on the full court press, man, and you dropped the ball.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? All she said was that she&#39;d be alone Saturday night with a pizza.
 <br>
 God, I&#39;m so stupid.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! So, Dad, the guys and I are thinking about getting jobs.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You have a job.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your job to get good grades, go to college, graduate and leave me.
 <br>
 Kitty, when I was his age, I worked in a slaughterhouse.
 <br>
 It was a good experience.
 <br>
 I learned how to use a hammer.
 <br>
 The new Fatso Burger&#39;s hiring people.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s dad owns it.
 <br>
 I guess I could get a job there.
 <br>
 There is plenty of time later to get a job to grind the joy out of your life.
 <br>
 It&#39;s never too early.
 <br>
 But let me tell you something.
 <br>
 Work is not about fun.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about work.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about seeing how much crap you can take from the boss-man.
 <br>
 And then taking some more.
 <br>
 And remember Hey, look at me.
 <br>
 Only quitters quit.
 <br>
 So, can I work? We&#39;re sure as hell gonna find out now, aren&#39;t we? So, big party Saturday night.
 <br>
 Whoopee.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Forman missed all of those signals.
 <br>
 What signals? Oh, no.
 <br>
 Poor me all alone in my big house.
 <br>
 Just me and my nightie.
 <br>
 If only there was some scrawny little neighbor boy here.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not scrawny.
 <br>
 - You know, why am I even talking to you? - I&#39;m all you got.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 So everybody knows? I&#39;m afraid so.
 <br>
 I just wanted to spend some time with him alone and now I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 How does that make you feel? Frustrated.
 <br>
 It&#39;s frustrating as hell.
 <br>
 I mean, I really put myself out there.
 <br>
 I see.
 <br>
 And do you have trouble sleeping at night? Sometimes, yeah, I do.
 <br>
 Do you think you&#39;d sleep better if you had a scrawny little neighbor boy up next to you? Okay, let&#39;s hear it.
 <br>
 - Hello, my name is Eric Forman.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Not with a loose hand.
 <br>
 Firm.
 <br>
 Not like a fish.
 <br>
 Again.
 <br>
 - Hello, my name - No.
 <br>
 Step into it.
 <br>
 - Stand up straight.
 <br>
 - Straight-up and hold the fish.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t be a smartmouth.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 No smartmouth.
 <br>
 Hello, my name is Eric Forman.
 <br>
 And? And Tell them about your junior achievement experience.
 <br>
 They could give a rat&#39;s ass about that.
 <br>
 Okay, show them your honorable mention from the science fair.
 <br>
 - Again.
 <br>
 - Right, rat&#39;s ass.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t slouch.
 <br>
 Wouldn&#39;t that fall under the &#34;stand up straight&#34; category? See? That&#39;s a smartmouth.
 <br>
 You&#39;re fired, Mr.
 <br>
 Smartmouth.
 <br>
 See? That&#39;s how that works.
 <br>
 First of all, people who work at Fatso Burger are special.
 <br>
 Now, I know you&#39;re looking at me and wondering how do I get where Ricky is? If you work hard, pay attention and use the proper finger-release technique on the slant cup dispenser, you could be me.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s get started.
 <br>
 Why do you want a career at Fatso Burger? I just think it will be a wonderful experience.
 <br>
 My girlfriend&#39;s dad owns it.
 <br>
 I love the uniforms.
 <br>
 To unionize the workers, man.
 <br>
 Tell me, what do you consider your best quality? I&#39;m a real people person.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t answer stupid questions.
 <br>
 I speak Dutch.
 <br>
 My eyes.
 <br>
 And I guess my butt, too.
 <br>
 Name something about yourself that you consider to be a weakness.
 <br>
 I allow people to boss me around.
 <br>
 I love chocolate.
 <br>
 I&#39;m brutally honest.
 <br>
 Pinhead.
 <br>
 - Where do you see yourself in five years? - Fatso Burger.
 <br>
 Covered in gold chains.
 <br>
 Rock star.
 <br>
 Or, no, movie star.
 <br>
 No, yeah, rock star.
 <br>
 Prison.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like to thank you all very much for coming in.
 <br>
 Eric, welcome to the Fatso Burger family.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - Daddy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sad.
 <br>
 - Why, kitten? Because Fatso Burger hired Eric instead of Michael.
 <br>
 - I know, kitten.
 <br>
 - Why would they do that, Daddy? Let me tell you a little story about Doofus and Diligent.
 <br>
 Doofus is friendly but he doesn&#39;t follow directions well.
 <br>
 Now, Diligent always does his job by the book.
 <br>
 This is how the book says to do it.
 <br>
 &#34;Wipe left to right.
 <br>
 &#34; Looks like a big order just came in.
 <br>
 &#34;Let me help, guys,&#34; says Diligent.
 <br>
 &#34;But wait a second.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Doofus?&#34; What do you know about that? Let&#39;s see what happens here.
 <br>
 &#34;I was in such a hurry to get back to work I almost forgot!&#34; Thatta boy, Diligent! &#34;Hey, there, Doofus.
 <br>
 &#34;You&#39;re supposed to wash your hands after using the facility.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;No way, Diligent.
 <br>
 That&#39;s for squares.
 <br>
 &#34; So Michael&#39;s a Doofus? And how.
 <br>
 We expect you to be responsible when we&#39;re out of town.
 <br>
 No parties.
 <br>
 And I want you to be nice to your sister.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t make Tina eat dirt.
 <br>
 I mean it.
 <br>
 And no boys.
 <br>
 They only want one thing and it&#39;s a dirty thing they want.
 <br>
 Enough said.
 <br>
 Looking sharp, Eric.
 <br>
 You gonna be around this weekend? Yes, sir.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Make sure no guys are hanging around Donna, capice? - So, I got a job.
 <br>
 - Yeah? Yeah, it seems I&#39;m really Fatso Burger material.
 <br>
 And I really wish I hadn&#39;t just said that.
 <br>
 No, it sounded cool.
 <br>
 So, are you still coming to the party on Saturday? I work late on Saturday night, but I mean, if I get off early I could, like, swing by.
 <br>
 Sounds good.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, it might be really late so, like, everyone else might be gone.
 <br>
 You know, if I&#39;m still up, I could leave the light on if you want me to.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 No, I mean, yeah, that would be great.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause that way, with the light on, I couldn&#39;t fall.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Sounds good.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 - That light? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Cool.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Bye, mom.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m going to the reservoir.
 <br>
 You wanna go? Nope.
 <br>
 I gotta work.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m meeting everyone at the hub.
 <br>
 You wanna go? Nope.
 <br>
 I gotta work.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric, I&#39;m going to see a movie.
 <br>
 You wanna go? Nope.
 <br>
 I gotta work.
 <br>
 Eric, I just got this new bikini, but I think it&#39;s too small.
 <br>
 - Could I model it for you? - Nope.
 <br>
 I gotta work.
 <br>
 How&#39;s that mopping coming along? I&#39;m just happy to be part of the Fatso Burger family.
 <br>
 You dumb ass.
 <br>
 Here, here, my minimum wage friend.
 <br>
 I demand service.
 <br>
 Welcome to Fatso Burger.
 <br>
 How may I serve you? That is so sad, burger boy.
 <br>
 You know, Jackie, I&#39;ve been wracking my brain trying to figure out why this guy didn&#39;t hire me.
 <br>
 Michael, I am so tired of hearing that.
 <br>
 You still have me.
 <br>
 You know what I think it is? What? I&#39;m great looking and he&#39;s jealous.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, Jackie, this body is a curse.
 <br>
 Besides, if you worked here you couldn&#39;t see me whenever I wanted you to.
 <br>
 Lover.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Please stop touching each other.
 <br>
 It gives me needs.
 <br>
 Are you ready to rock and roll? Toga! Hey, man, nice dress.
 <br>
 You brought three beers, meathead? We&#39;ll share.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s to our wasted youth Party.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 Good evening, Donna.
 <br>
 Which of these ladies are easy? Donna, some of your creepy friends are using Dad&#39;s stereo.
 <br>
 You guys, no one&#39;s allowed in the house! Hello, pretty lady.
 <br>
 Hi! She&#39;s not a pretty lady.
 <br>
 She&#39;s my sister and she&#39;s 14.
 <br>
 - You know, in my country - It&#39;s illegal here.
 <br>
 I see.
 <br>
 Michael, you and I need to talk.
 <br>
 Inside.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m miserable.
 <br>
 This party sucks.
 <br>
 - You know what&#39;ll make you feel better? A scrawny little neighbor boy.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you take off, go see him, I&#39;ll watch the kids? Yeah.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 Welcome to Fatso Burger.
 <br>
 How may I serve you? - Honey, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 I have to say that.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I was on a break from the hospital so I thought I&#39;d bring you some nice, hot soup.
 <br>
 Oyster crackers.
 <br>
 Thank God.
 <br>
 Something to eat.
 <br>
 - So, how&#39;s it going? - It&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - So, how&#39;s it going? - It&#39;s terrible.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m exhausted, I&#39;m behind on all my homework and I think this polyester uniform is giving me a body rash.
 <br>
 I swept the driveway for you.
 <br>
 Mom, I&#39;m sorry, I forgot.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You know what? Here, I&#39;ll do this.
 <br>
 You sit down and you eat your soup.
 <br>
 You know Eric, if you want to quit, your father and I will completely understand.
 <br>
 - Did Dad tell you that? - You leave your father to me.
 <br>
 You just worry about you.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman.
 <br>
 Who said you were on break? - I did.
 <br>
 - And who are you? - I&#39;m his mother.
 <br>
 - Good enough, then.
 <br>
 Michael, sit.
 <br>
 We need to talk.
 <br>
 Whoa! Ahoy, Jackie! Welcome aboard the USS Kelso.
 <br>
 You know, sometimes I&#39;m beginning to think you&#39;re a real screw-up.
 <br>
 You see, one day I want a house, and kids, and maybe a chandelier.
 <br>
 And if you can&#39;t give me those things, Michael then this is all a big waste of time.
 <br>
 You just You gotta try harder.
 <br>
 Wait, Michael, something feels wet.
 <br>
 &#34;Dear penthouse.
 <br>
 &#34; No.
 <br>
 You popped the waterbed! It must&#39;ve been my roach clip.
 <br>
 Jackie, maybe they won&#39;t notice.
 <br>
 I am in love with a Doofus! Hey.
 <br>
 Donna! Welcome to Fatso Burger, how Screw it.
 <br>
 - What are you doing here? - I was bored.
 <br>
 Really? You left your own party to come see me? It&#39;s not much of a party without you there.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re so queer.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 Eric, the whole reason I told you my parents were going away was so we could hang.
 <br>
 Together.
 <br>
 You know, alone.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I know, it&#39;s just So Look, Donna, I&#39;m sorry, okay? I would love to come over, but this is my job.
 <br>
 And, work isn&#39;t fun, you know? It&#39;s work.
 <br>
 And only quitters quit.
 <br>
 As long as you know what&#39;s important.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll see you around.
 <br>
 What do you know, Kelso? We&#39;re out of beer.
 <br>
 You know what? Forman&#39;s old man&#39;s got a fridge in the garage and I know he&#39;s got beer in it.
 <br>
 It was his idea.
 <br>
 Remind me to kick your ass.
 <br>
 Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Is Forman around? He sure as hell is not inside that fridge.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, you&#39;re home.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Yeah, came back early.
 <br>
 Yeah, missed the kids too much.
 <br>
 What&#39;re you doing here? I was just coming home from work and I noticed that someone left your porch light on.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t even see that from your house.
 <br>
 - Good eye.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 You know, Eric, that&#39;s what I like about you.
 <br>
 I ask you to look out for Donna and here you are in the middle of the night hanging around the back door doing your job.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a good guy, Eric.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care what they say about you.
 <br>
 Gotcha.
 <br>
 Goodnight now.
 <br>
 Okay, I was just gonna Yeah, there you go.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Goodnight then.
 <br>
 Goodnight, Eric.
 <br>
 - Dad.
 <br>
 - Eric.
 <br>
 - Dad, I&#39;m quitting my job.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re quitting? Yeah, I&#39;m quitting.
 <br>
 I&#39;m irresponsible, I&#39;m a quitter, and I couldn&#39;t kill a cow with a hammer.
 <br>
 - So what do you say to that? - Everybody quits their first job, Eric.
 <br>
 It&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 What? That&#39;s it? I gotta say, Dad, I&#39;m a little disappointed here.
 <br>
 - I mean, it wasn&#39;t a man&#39;s job anyway.
 <br>
 - Red.
 <br>
 Come on, Kitty, it was a hair-net name-tag, nothing kind of a job.
 <br>
 That&#39;s more like it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just as well.
 <br>
 It was cutting into your chores anyway.
 <br>
 You did a half-assed job sweeping the driveway.
 <br>
 I thought he did a wonderful job.
 <br>
 It didn&#39;t look wonderful to me.
 <br>
 Okay, then.
 <br>
 Sweep it yourself.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s that big Fatso smile? Ricky, how did you start working at Fatso Burger? Great story.
 <br>
 I was gonna go to college but they made me Assistant Manager, threw the money at me so I never got to go.
 <br>
 But now I&#39;m my own boss.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 I answer to a lot of people.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I quit now.
 <br>
 Yeah, I certainly would.
 <br>
