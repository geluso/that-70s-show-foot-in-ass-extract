 Push.
 <br>
 Push.
 <br>
 Come on, you gotta push it.
 <br>
 - How much longer? - 10 seconds.
 <br>
 You gotta push harder or it&#39;s not gonna work.
 <br>
 - This is so stupid.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s not stupid.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna love it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna love it.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s time.
 <br>
 Step away from the door.
 <br>
 Kelso, you&#39;re a genius.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s magic.
 <br>
 My God.
 <br>
 Finally.
 <br>
 I am so dehydrated.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Piggly-Wiggly Diet Creme Soda.
 <br>
 I told you my top three choices were Tab, Fresca, or Diet Rite.
 <br>
 Again, you get Piggly-Wiggly Diet Creme Soda.
 <br>
 - Then I&#39;ll just have water.
 <br>
 - You know, there&#39;s a hose in the backyard.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve noticed that the pop selection has really went downhill since your dad got laid off.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not laid off, he&#39;s just part-time.
 <br>
 And shut up.
 <br>
 Kids.
 <br>
 Kids, kids, kids.
 <br>
 The President is coming.
 <br>
 What President? The President of these United States, Gerald R.
 <br>
 Ford, the 36th Eighth 40th I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the President.
 <br>
 Why would Ford come to Point Place? Because we are a whistle-stop along his Wisconsin campaign trail.
 <br>
 My dad organized it.
 <br>
 Dear, the next time you know a president is coming to town please give me a little more notice.
 <br>
 I need to vacuum.
 <br>
 Eric, you tidy up this basement.
 <br>
 A pie! I gotta make a pie! Wow.
 <br>
 The President&#39;s coming.
 <br>
 You know what we should do? That door thing again! Yeah! Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! So how&#39;s the car? Real good.
 <br>
 By real good, you mean you rotated those tires like I asked you to? Dad, don&#39;t they rotate every time I drive? - You being a smartmouth? - Yes, and I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Tuna casserole again? Well, okay, how about we don&#39;t pay the car insurance and we&#39;ll all have steak? All right.
 <br>
 Well, just imagine, President Ford is coming here.
 <br>
 Red, we need to get rid of the oil stains in the driveway.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like he&#39;s coming to our house.
 <br>
 And if he did I&#39;d kick him in the keister.
 <br>
 Stop it.
 <br>
 How can you say that? You voted for Gerald Ford.
 <br>
 Kitty, no one voted for Gerald Ford.
 <br>
 But he still is our President.
 <br>
 The boy&#39;s old enough to hear that kind of talk.
 <br>
 Eric, say that your job was sent to a plant in Guatela-who-the-hell-cares.
 <br>
 Now, are you gonna vote for the guy that let that happen? Red, President Ford didn&#39;t take your job.
 <br>
 He took Nixon&#39;s.
 <br>
 Eric, we&#39;re waiting.
 <br>
 Well I believe that everyone&#39;s political opinion is valid and worth hearing.
 <br>
 That&#39;s perfect, Eric.
 <br>
 Use that line when you run for Miss America.
 <br>
 Settle down and we&#39;ll start the assembly.
 <br>
 Now, concerning the canned goods drive.
 <br>
 Motor oil is not a food.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 And all your booing isn&#39;t gonna make it one.
 <br>
 Now as you all know President Ford will be visiting our fair city.
 <br>
 And I know there are some of you ne&#39;er-do-wells out there that might be planning some sort of quote unquote, social statement-type protest.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 Who cares if Ford is coming? It&#39;s better than when the Oscar Mayer Weenie Mobile drove through.
 <br>
 They didn&#39;t even stop.
 <br>
 They just slowed down and threw a bunch of hot dog whistles at us.
 <br>
 Two girls in a phallic RV.
 <br>
 Driving around, handing out things you blow.
 <br>
 What a great country.
 <br>
 So let me tell you another thing Mr.
 <br>
 or Mrs.
 <br>
 Punk.
 <br>
 Protesting accomplishes nothing.
 <br>
 Oh, sure, you might see a chance to prove your manhood or show you&#39;re cool but this is our President.
 <br>
 Our President, darn it! So no shenanigans, you hear me? And if that&#39;s your kind of attitude you might just as well go home right now.
 <br>
 So President Ford should be arriving at noon.
 <br>
 Man, deviled eggs.
 <br>
 Are these for anybody? Hi, Daddy.
 <br>
 Hi, Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hi, kitten.
 <br>
 Now, look, we&#39;re talking about adult stuff here.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you and your friend head up to your room? Now, the most important part of our presidential rally is the townspeople &#34;Q&#34; and &#34;A&#34; section.
 <br>
 Just so, everyone&#39;s clear the &#34;Q&#34; stands for &#34;Question&#34;, the &#34;A&#34; for &#34;Answer.
 <br>
 &#34; All yours, Jack.
 <br>
 This is where normal folks step up to the microphone and ask the President questions.
 <br>
 Now, the important thing is to choose the right person, you know.
 <br>
 A working class guy.
 <br>
 Your average Joe.
 <br>
 I guess someone you and I would call a loser.
 <br>
 So, of course, I thought of you.
 <br>
 We&#39;d like you to ask President Ford a question.
 <br>
 So what do you say to that? I say, no, thank you, and I want my crescent wrench back.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 No, you keep working on your pies.
 <br>
 Just imagine, Red, you, the little guy get to have your opinions heard by the most powerful man in America.
 <br>
 Take advantage of this opportunity.
 <br>
 - Turn that light off.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 Look, guys, we gotta do something that says we will not pay homage to a corrupt electoral system.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 A bloody coup.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good, but we&#39;re looking for something great.
 <br>
 Something that would make our founding fathers proud, man, you know? - Let&#39;s streak! - Bingo! Yeah! I&#39;ve always wanted to do that just run buck naked through a sea of people.
 <br>
 Be free and shake it around.
 <br>
 All right, who&#39;s in? Will people be chasing us with torches and pointy sticks? - No.
 <br>
 - Then I am in.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Eric? - Are you in? - Streaking.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m completely pro-nudity but I think my dad might kill me, and I&#39;m anti-being killed.
 <br>
 If there wasn&#39;t some huge downside to doing something this stupid it wouldn&#39;t be worth doing, you know? Good point.
 <br>
 And I could write some really great slogan like &#34;I hate the fuzz&#34; on my ass.
 <br>
 If you hate the fuzz on your ass, why don&#39;t you just shave it off? Pretty snazzy? Looking good, Dad.
 <br>
 I got one for you, too.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna wear them to meet the President.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Honey, you&#39;re missing the big picture.
 <br>
 Let me go get the other jumpsuits.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll see.
 <br>
 Mom, why are you doing this? Honey, there are lots of things I do to make your father happy that I don&#39;t really like.
 <br>
 - Mom! - No, not that.
 <br>
 I love that.
 <br>
 I meant like fishing.
 <br>
 See? When we stand together, we&#39;re the American flag.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not wearing a striped jumpsuit.
 <br>
 - No, honey, you&#39;re the field of blue.
 <br>
 Bye, now.
 <br>
 But, Donna, you&#39;re part of the family.
 <br>
 My, this hurts.
 <br>
 - Yello.
 <br>
 - Good news, Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking about it and I&#39;ve decided, I will ask Ford a question.
 <br>
 Red, this is good news.
 <br>
 And I could sure use it right about now.
 <br>
 Yeah, glad I could help.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna ask him a question all right.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s gonna be a damn good one.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Now, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m simply gonna ask him how the hell he&#39;s gonna fix this economy.
 <br>
 Honey, he wouldn&#39;t know that.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the President.
 <br>
 All this food for 45 cents, it is unbelievable.
 <br>
 I see.
 <br>
 So, Forman, the rally&#39;s tonight, man.
 <br>
 What&#39;s your decision? - Yeah, are you gonna streak or not? - Don&#39;t pressure him.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;ve been doing some thinking, and I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re gonna look like a bunch of idiots.
 <br>
 A bunch of naked idiots.
 <br>
 Thanks, Kelso.
 <br>
 Look, we must keep this quiet.
 <br>
 It can&#39;t go beyond this table.
 <br>
 If my father finds out what we have planned, he will nail me to the wall.
 <br>
 Why are you all sitting on one side of the table? Okay, now.
 <br>
 Make way for my Presidential pies.
 <br>
 See? Cherry, mock apple, blueberry.
 <br>
 See that? Red, white, and blue.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like the beginning to Love, American Style in pie.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Lookit.
 <br>
 See, honey, you&#39;re not looking.
 <br>
 Yeah, pie.
 <br>
 Dad.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti wanted me to give you this.
 <br>
 - What is it? - It&#39;s your question for President Ford.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m working on my question for President Ford.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 This is the one the committee made up for you.
 <br>
 &#34;What has been your favorite parade?&#34; This is asinine.
 <br>
 - Macy&#39;s? - No contest.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Can I borrow your trench coat? I can ask the President any damn thing I want.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna be a puppet for Bob&#39;s committee.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take real good care of it and I&#39;ll bring it back as soon as I possibly can.
 <br>
 Honey, just take the coat and leave.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Eric, a man has to stand up and be heard.
 <br>
 I will not sit quietly by while everything is taken away from me.
 <br>
 They took my job, my stability now they want to take away my right to free speech.
 <br>
 You still have the Toyota, it gets great mileage.
 <br>
 Where is the America that I knew as a boy? Where? You tell me, dear God, where? Okay, I really hate being in this room right now.
 <br>
 Okay, when the President starts his speech here I&#39;ll blow my Oscar Mayer whistle and we go.
 <br>
 Did you write, &#34;I hate the fuzz&#34; on your butt? Yeah.
 <br>
 - Donna, here&#39;s your lipstick back.
 <br>
 - Keep it.
 <br>
 - You got the masks? - Yeah, I got three Snoopys and one Nixon.
 <br>
 Not it.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 Fez, how&#39;d you know how to do that? My country invented &#34;not it.
 <br>
 &#34; So can we go already? I&#39;m itching to release the hound here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s go time.
 <br>
 Now, look at you guys.
 <br>
 What is it with you young people and Colombo? Bye.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t you going, Donna? No.
 <br>
 My Dad&#39;s gonna make me wear this really queer jumpsuit.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if I can do it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just too embarrassing.
 <br>
 You know, Donna, my grandmother came from Sweden and she had this thick accent and it embarrassed me to no end.
 <br>
 I asked her not to come to my high school graduation &#39;cause I didn&#39;t want my friends to hear her talk and she didn&#39;t come.
 <br>
 Sixteen years later, she got the gout and died.
 <br>
 You see? No.
 <br>
 All families are embarrassing.
 <br>
 And if they&#39;re not embarrassing, then they&#39;re dead.
 <br>
 All right, try and blend in.
 <br>
 see you alone like that, so I came over and here you are.
 <br>
 Hey, you hitting on my girlfriend? Michael, he&#39;s not - Hey, man.
 <br>
 You wanna go? Come on.
 <br>
 - Yeah, let&#39;s go, cowboy! - You are so lucky I&#39;m naked, pal.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 There&#39;s supposed to be a blue field of stars there.
 <br>
 Oh, honey.
 <br>
 Now, if we just start to sway back and forth it&#39;ll look like the flag is waving in the wind.
 <br>
 Oh, god.
 <br>
 - There&#39;s another guy in a trench coat.
 <br>
 - I bet he&#39;s a streaker, too.
 <br>
 Fez, he&#39;s with Secret Service.
 <br>
 - How about that man? - Yeah, Secret Service.
 <br>
 - And that man? - Yeah.
 <br>
 And that man with the dog? Yeah.
 <br>
 - The dog is looking at us.
 <br>
 Come here, boy.
 <br>
 - No, Fez! - Man, I just thought of something.
 <br>
 - What? What are we going to do with our trench coats? I mean, after we rip them off, we can&#39;t come back here and get them.
 <br>
 - Shucks.
 <br>
 - God, this is all my fault.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;ll hold the coats.
 <br>
 You guys streak.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 I just thought of something, too.
 <br>
 We&#39;re naked, and there&#39;s a lot of dogs here.
 <br>
 Maybe we should just sit down.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 - Me, too.
 <br>
 - Me, too.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Ladies and gentlemen  the President of the United States of America Gerald R.
 <br>
 Ford! What are you doing hiding over Okay.
 <br>
 Back off.
 <br>
 I am a flag.
 <br>
 - Are you gonna streak? - No, we took a vote and it&#39;s unanimous.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all very chicken.
 <br>
 That&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen you naked.
 <br>
 - You&#39;ve never seen me naked.
 <br>
 - Like a zillion times.
 <br>
 When we were kids, you were always running around the neighborhood naked, screaming, &#34;Wee, wee! Pee, pee!&#34; Now it&#39;s time for the &#34;Q&#34; and &#34;A&#34; portion of our program.
 <br>
 First up, I&#39;d like to introduce Red Forman.
 <br>
 Red is a father of two wonderful children and how he&#39;s managed to keep them clothed and fed while being cut back to halftime at the plant is beyond me.
 <br>
 But he doesn&#39;t blame the President for his misfortune.
 <br>
 No, sir.
 <br>
 He only blames himself.
 <br>
 I give you Red Forman! Mr.
 <br>
 President I I Come on, Red.
 <br>
 Your dad is bombing.
 <br>
 Wee, wee! Pee, pee! Hey, Gerry, here&#39;s my question.
 <br>
 How the hell could you pardon Nixon? - Hey, son.
 <br>
 - Hi, Dad.
 <br>
 Hey, good job at the rally today.
 <br>
 Not bad.
 <br>
 I kind of stumbled there at the start but I think I nailed him with a good one.
 <br>
 Anyway, it was pretty cool.
 <br>
 Yeah, well sometimes a man&#39;s gotta do what he thinks is right.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m gonna call it a night.
 <br>
 All right, son.
 <br>
 Good night.
 <br>
 Good night, Dad.
 <br>
 And next time, don&#39;t wear black socks.
 <br>
 You looked like an ass.
 <br>
 How could they not catch you? I guess no one wants to tackle a naked guy.
 <br>
 So true.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t see anything, did you? No.
 <br>
 Well maybe just a bit.
 <br>
 But not the bit.
 <br>
 Wait, what do you mean &#34;bit&#34;?
 <br>
