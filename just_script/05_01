 ( Phone Ringing ) Hello? Donna, it&#39;s you! How&#39;s California? Have you run into Johnny Carson yet? No.
 <br>
 I read he won&#39;t eat corn.
 <br>
 What? Oh, Eric.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I know he wants to talk to you.
 <br>
 He hasn&#39;t heard from you all summer.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get him.
 <br>
 Eric! Ow! Eric.
 <br>
 Eric, are you in the bathroom? ( Eric ) Yes.
 <br>
 - Well, get off, because- - Mom? Mom.
 <br>
 When this door is closed, it&#39;s my sacred alone time.
 <br>
 Okay? Think of it as church.
 <br>
 - But, I- - Mom.
 <br>
 ! Fine.
 <br>
 Gets up at noon, sits on the toilet until dinner- What kind of summer is that? ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) Well, you made me lose my concentration.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m gonna have to go back there in about an hour.
 <br>
 I just wanted to tell you Donna called.
 <br>
 Her number&#39;s on the pad by the kitchen phone.
 <br>
 What? Why wouldn&#39;t you say something? And I&#39;m staying out of this, but if you&#39;d eat a little bran you could&#39;ve taken that call yourself.
 <br>
 ( Whistling ) - Where&#39;s the notepad? - Here.
 <br>
 Quit twitchin&#39;.
 <br>
 What? There&#39;s no number.
 <br>
 Dad.
 <br>
 ( Whistling Continues ) Step away from the vehicle.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it a little early for you to be hopped up? - Empty your pockets, now.
 <br>
 - Get the hell out of my pants! Got it.
 <br>
 What the hell is wrong with him? He has low self-esteem because you are too domineering.
 <br>
 Red, you&#39;re gonna let Forman get away with that, man? He just felt you up.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s the foot in the ass? - Unless you&#39;re getting too old.
 <br>
 - Shut it.
 <br>
 And go shave that thing.
 <br>
 You look like a damn Hungarian.
 <br>
 -  ( Stereo: Rock ) - It&#39;s ringing.
 <br>
 - ( Singsongy ) It&#39;s ringing.
 <br>
 -( Line Ringing ) Oh, my God, it&#39;s ringing.
 <br>
 And Eric chickens out again.
 <br>
 Quack, quack, quack.
 <br>
 Forman, what&#39;s the problem? It&#39;s just- I want to tell her to come home, that I miss her that I love her.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s too much to say over the phone.
 <br>
 Look, Eric, just write her a letter.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how I broke up with Michael.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I was able to take my time and come up with good synonyms for &#39;&#39;cowardly, won&#39;t-marry-me loser run-away-to-California jackass.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Jackie, I&#39;m charismatic in person.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got these awesome hand gestures.
 <br>
 And, uh, I kind of, like, waggle my eyebrows when I talk.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 You do that on purpose? Thanks, you guys.
 <br>
 That&#39;s-That&#39;s helpful.
 <br>
 ( Continues ) You know what? That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just show up in California and, like, blow her mind.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean when the Empire killed Luke Skywalker&#39;s aunt and uncle, did he just call &#39;em up? - Oh, God.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 He hopped on the Millennium Falcon and he paid a little visit to the Death Star.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Do chickens go quack, or did I mess that up? I sat at my mom&#39;s house for three hours.
 <br>
 Eric still hasn&#39;t called.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what might make you feel better? Playing pinball over there.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have any quarters.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 You know what might help me? If you could tell me how you got overJackie.
 <br>
 You rememberJackie, don&#39;t you? - Who&#39;s Jackie? - Uh Jackie was my dog.
 <br>
 She died in a Big Wheel accident.
 <br>
 No, Annette.
 <br>
 I meantJackie, his ex-girlfriend.
 <br>
 Uh, also dead.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s not dead.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s going on here? - Why are you lying to me? - No, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not lying,Jackie- Annette.
 <br>
 Look, baby.
 <br>
 Well, my work here is done.
 <br>
 You want to go to California to get Donna? You can&#39;t go to California.
 <br>
 But I have to tell Donna I love her and that she should be back here with me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s sweet.
 <br>
 I think it would sound especially good on the phone.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t call till after 7:00 when the rates go down.
 <br>
 Well, I can&#39;t call her.
 <br>
 I mean - did Luke Skywalker- - Oh.
 <br>
 Would you stop.
 <br>
 Luke Skywalker this.
 <br>
 Luke Skywalker that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sick of hearing about that little fruit.
 <br>
 Luke Skywalker is not- He and Leia clearly- I- Mom, Dad.
 <br>
 - This is important.
 <br>
 - ( Red ) No.
 <br>
 No California.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s important? School.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna be a senior, and you need to buckle down.
 <br>
 Luke Skywalker would&#39;ve buckled down.
 <br>
 Forman, there&#39;s a flight to California in four hours, and you&#39;re on it.
 <br>
 Before you get all gushy, we didn&#39;t pay for it.
 <br>
 We stole the money from your secret stash in the Scooby-Doo thermos.
 <br>
 You guys know about Scooby-Doo? It was a good try, but you should have known that eventually I would need to take some cocoa on the go.
 <br>
 Well, thanks, you guys but my parents will kill me.
 <br>
 - No, Eric.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll cover for you.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Believe me.
 <br>
 I got no problem foolin&#39; whitey.
 <br>
 Hyde, you&#39;re white.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Barely.
 <br>
 Eric, if you love her, you have to go.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna do this.
 <br>
 Damn it, I&#39;m goin&#39;.
 <br>
 I gotta go pack.
 <br>
 Hey, let me help.
 <br>
 I love putting together outfits.
 <br>
 - Finally.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I thought they&#39;d never leave.
 <br>
 You know, Steven, it was really nice of you to get that ticket for Eric.
 <br>
 This usually works a whole lot better when you don&#39;t talk.
 <br>
 Look, Annette.
 <br>
 You&#39;re way more important to me than Jackie ever was.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re blonde.
 <br>
 You&#39;re beautiful.
 <br>
 You practically never wear a whole shirt.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just the thought of you with somebody else got me really upset.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really upset.
 <br>
 Which is why I propose that we do something special and romantic.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 Michael, I don&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m a virgin.
 <br>
 - What? A coincidence.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 So let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 First-timers, yeah.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m gonna go cool off.
 <br>
 - Kelso- - Ah-ah, one second.
 <br>
 She&#39;s coolin&#39; off.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 I was wondering if you and Annette could maybe discuss your plans to do it or not do it when I&#39;m not around.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re never not around.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like a carbuncle.
 <br>
 Kelso, you don&#39;t even know what a carbuncle is.
 <br>
 Well, I know it&#39;s gross, and it doesn&#39;t go away.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just I don&#39;t know anybody else.
 <br>
 California people are freaks.
 <br>
 Like that guy.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t smoke that out here! I miss Eric.
 <br>
 That guy even looks like Eric.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Eric! Donna! Kelso, what the hell are you doing? Winning.
 <br>
 I oughta- I- I can&#39;t believe you came here for me.
 <br>
 Of course I did.
 <br>
 Donna, I love you.
 <br>
 And I have so much to say, but I- You guys can French all you want.
 <br>
 I totally won.
 <br>
 - Hey, Red.
 <br>
 - Good day, Mr.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s the other idiot? Other idiot? Do we know another idiot? - Where&#39;s Eric? - Where&#39;s Eric? Where are you, man, and who wants to know? The U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 government, that&#39;s who.
 <br>
 Like, I read by 1 984, the government will have tracking devices on all of us.
 <br>
 And after that, they&#39;re gonna jam electrodes in our brains so they can read our memories.
 <br>
 Damn U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 government.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Damn U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 government&#39;&#39;? Without our government, you&#39;d be stuck in Siberia now suckin&#39; the juice from a rotten commie potato.
 <br>
 Let me tell you something.
 <br>
 If the U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 government decides to stick a tracking device up your ass you say, &#39;&#39;Thank you and God bless America.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; He&#39;s so easy.
 <br>
 And then after Michael threw up, I told him &#39;&#39;You&#39;re not supposed to eat the plastic wrapping.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And that&#39;s how we met.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 That&#39;s- That&#39;s like Love Story.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I wish there was more to talk about.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Would you look at her.
 <br>
 She&#39;s so hot, she could be a robot.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;A robot&#39;&#39;? Whatever.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 You have the van, and we want to go home.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Uh-uh.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t leave Annette.
 <br>
 I love her.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t love her.
 <br>
 I love parts of her.
 <br>
 I mean, unlikeJackie, she believes in me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I told Annette I wanted to be an astronaut and she said that she thought I could.
 <br>
 To be fair, she wants to be a lady astronaut.
 <br>
 I mean, come on, guys.
 <br>
 Just give me a few hours.
 <br>
 Okay? If- Look.
 <br>
 This girl is beautiful, and she believes in me.
 <br>
 And if I can get her to put out, she&#39;ll be three out of three.
 <br>
 Right now, she&#39;s only two out of three.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sorry, but 50% just ain&#39;t gonna cut it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Look, Steven.
 <br>
 These last few weeks with you have been really dirty and really wrong.
 <br>
 Jackie, talking is for people who have something in common.
 <br>
 Oh, good God.
 <br>
 You kids switch partners more than square dancers.
 <br>
 Uh, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not what you think.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not together.
 <br>
 Then what&#39;s going on in my kitchen? Um Eric&#39;s in California.
 <br>
 Jackie, you just totally burned Forman.
 <br>
 That was so badass.
 <br>
 So, Annette, I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m leaving in a couple hours.
 <br>
 So I guess the question is what, oh, what can two virgins do to kill an afternoon? Well, there is something.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s kind of wet and dirty.
 <br>
 Sold! Having fun? No.
 <br>
 I mean, these are our last hours together and you&#39;re not nude.
 <br>
 So all you care about is sex? I thought there was more to you than that.
 <br>
 But there isn&#39;t.
 <br>
 But there is.
 <br>
 I believe in you.
 <br>
 - Stop saying that.
 <br>
 - But I do.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Start digging the moat.
 <br>
 ( Waves Crashing ) I was so scared that I&#39;d never feel like this with you again.
 <br>
 I mean Eric, after last year- - Donna.
 <br>
 - I- About Casey and all that stuff? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Okay? I just want to be with you.
 <br>
 You know, all summer I hated California.
 <br>
 But now that you&#39;re here, it&#39;s, like, amazing.
 <br>
 This is the most romantic night of my whole life.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 I have sand in my crack.
 <br>
 - Yeah, me too.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Eric, I want to go home.
 <br>
 ( Eric Chuckles ) Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 How was your date with Annette? We went to a carnival.
 <br>
 I won her six stuffed animals.
 <br>
 Then we shared a giant pretzel.
 <br>
 And then I walked her home, and she gave me a good-night kiss on the cheek.
 <br>
 You know, in Wisconsin if you win a girl a giant purple rhinoceros she puts out! ( Pops ) ( Engine Rewing ) ( Horn Honks ) So, my folks have no idea I was gone.
 <br>
 - No idea.
 <br>
 You&#39;re golden.
 <br>
 - Ah.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Hyde! - Hey.
 <br>
 You got a beard! You look so old.
 <br>
 Of course I look old, man.
 <br>
 Party more than you.
 <br>
 Work more, drank more, and slept with way more chicks.
 <br>
 I&#39;m exhausted, man.
 <br>
 Fez, my little man! How was your summer? Well, I saw a boob and a half down by the pool.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Pool boob.
 <br>
 Nice.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Donna, I know you&#39;re nervous about seeing people at school after running away and all but I want you to know it&#39;s all under control.
 <br>
 I told everyone you went away to have a baby.
 <br>
 - What? - Yeah.
 <br>
 It was badass.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I say badass now.
 <br>
 Hi, Daddy.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you &#39;&#39;Daddy&#39;&#39; me.
 <br>
 Although it does sound good to hear those words again.
 <br>
 - Bob.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 You&#39;re in big trouble, young lady.
 <br>
 Now get home now.
 <br>
 Move.
 <br>
 Well I guess that&#39;s what happens when you, uh, disobey your parents, huh? Hey, why the long faces? Did you think that I- No, no.
 <br>
 Funny story.
 <br>
 True story.
 <br>
 I&#39;m walkin&#39; home from the library and who should drive by? Kelso and Donna.
 <br>
 Back from California.
 <br>
 Where they were.
 <br>
 Not me.
 <br>
 Oh, hey? They know.
 <br>
 What do you have to say for yourself? I- I brought you a seashell.
 <br>
 Just get in the house.
 <br>
 ( Mock Sobbing ) Do you have any idea how much trouble you&#39;re in? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 And it was worth it.
 <br>
 - ( Car Chase On TV) - Oh, not this again.
 <br>
 I told you, it gives me needs.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be upstairs.
 <br>
 Too late.
 <br>
 - Why are we watching this? It&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re stupid.
 <br>
 Man, I&#39;ve been gone all summer and I get back, and everything is just the same.
 <br>
 I guess nothing ever changes around here.
 <br>
