<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Enjoy your Anne Murray.
 <br>
 Though, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s possible.
 <br>
 - Hello Steven.
 <br>
 - He, hi, man ! Leo, this is my dad, WB.
 <br>
 Ohh ! Now I&#39;ve seen everything.
 <br>
 You&#39;re surprised he&#39;s black, huh ? No, his fly&#39;s open.
 <br>
 Wow, look at all these kids.
 <br>
 Pretty busy for a Tuesday morning.
 <br>
 Yeah it&#39;s kind of a fire sale.
 <br>
 We put stuff on sale, then I go down to the high school and pull the fire alarm.
 <br>
 If the store&#39;s keeps doing OK, there might be a nice bonus in your future.
 <br>
 Or how I like to call it, a retroactive child support.
 <br>
 Hey who&#39;s pretty boy ? Oh hey, I&#39;m Randy, but I really wouldn&#39;t call me pretty.
 <br>
 I&#39;m more like solitary, angular yet soft.
 <br>
 Really anything that would describe Faye Dunaway.
 <br>
 So Steven, what are you and Faye Dunaway doing this weekend ? Oh, well, the Point Place youth club is doing a big thrash clean up, so we were going down there and throw cans at them.
 <br>
 Check these out.
 <br>
 Front-row tickets to Eric Clapton in Chicago ? That&#39;s the coolest thing anyone has ever done for me.
 <br>
 What show you a couple of concert tickets ? You&#39;re not going ! So listen, I stopped by to see if you wanted to house-sit for me.
 <br>
 You know, bringing the mail, water the plants, feed my dog Whity.
 <br>
 Your dog&#39;s name is Whity ? Nooo, I was talking to you.
 <br>
 Yes, guess I can do that.
 <br>
 Wow man, I&#39;m staying at my Dad&#39;s house, it&#39;s like the childhood I never had.
 <br>
 And I won&#39;t be there.
 <br>
 Just like the childhood you did have.
 <br>
 Mrs Forman ? I need to talk to you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really sorry that Randy and I were kissing in Eric&#39;s room.
 <br>
 It was inappropriate.
 <br>
 Oh actually honey I&#39;m surprised you even had time to apologize.
 <br>
 I thought you would be up there making out with the rest of Wisconsin.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing showing affection outside of your own home anyway ? Kitty and I, we never kiss or hug in public.
 <br>
 As far as the rest of the world is concerned, we&#39;re complete strangers.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t mean to offend you.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve always been like a mother to me.
 <br>
 Like remember when you made me hot coco when my parents got snowed in that swinger&#39;s club ? Oh Donna I&#39;m not going to let one little incident ruin a lifelong friendship.
 <br>
 Oh hey, look Red, this egg is kinda shaped like Randy&#39;s head.
 <br>
 And now it&#39;s thrash just like Donna.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Season 8 episode 14 &#34;Son and Daughter&#34; Traduction par Mona Sax Oh, this pineapple reminds me of Donna, it&#39;s a little tart.
 <br>
 hey don&#39;t call my daughter names, you can call me names but I really wish you wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Why, I just don&#39;t know what she sees in Randy.
 <br>
 He&#39;s so charming and friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand.
 <br>
 What a jackass ! Well I like him.
 <br>
 He calls me Mr.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 Where did he come up with that one ? Kitty, if Donna&#39;s going to date anyone, why not him ? I mean his bright, he&#39;s good with tools and most important, he has never once tried to teach me the ways of the Jedi.
 <br>
 Wait a minute, you like Randy too ? Well I&#39;m just saying, I don&#39;t hate him as mush as I hate most people.
 <br>
 Well you have said a lot of hurtful things but this is the worse.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 She&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 This  pineapple&#39;s delicious.
 <br>
 See now this is the kind of house I want.
 <br>
 And I know that if I work hard enough, I can find someone would buy one for me.
 <br>
 Men, this place is clean.
 <br>
 You&#39;re sure no women leaves here, man ? Steven, please, I don&#39;t need a woman living here to keep a clean house.
 <br>
 I have a maid and she&#39;s a white girl.
 <br>
 And then Mrs Forman said you looked like an egg and then threw your broken head into the thrash.
 <br>
 Well I don&#39;t take it too personally because I&#39;ve noticed something about Mrs Forman, she&#39;s a wackedoo.
 <br>
 Oh, cool ! Peter Frampton gave you a signed guitar.
 <br>
 He you know what, I have a handful of his hair and one of them has a little piece of skin at the end of it.
 <br>
 Yeah, she keeps it next to Leith Gareth&#39;s used q-tip.
 <br>
 Hey, I had to kiss a roodie named Larry for that one.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s the kitchen, there&#39;s the living-room and there&#39;s the bar.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t touch anything ! Don&#39;t worry man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll treat this place like a broken tool of myself.
 <br>
 Hey guys, the toilet seat there is heated.
 <br>
 It felt so good on my face.
 <br>
 Man, watching your Dad&#39;s place is a big responsibility and I just know that the 500 strangers we invited to the party are going to give the respect it deserves.
 <br>
 No way, man.
 <br>
 WB is trusting me and I&#39;m not thrashing his house.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s the beauty of our plan, we will thrash it for you.
 <br>
 Oh ! Hyde doesn&#39;t want to disappoint his Daddy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Hyde and I love my Dad and he loves me and we&#39;re making up for lost time and Actually that&#39;s kind of touching.
 <br>
 Come on Hyde ! Don&#39;t you want to find out if 500 people can fit in that pool ? No, alright ? I&#39;m not letting you guys taught me into having a party.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not doing something that stupid.
 <br>
 Look everybody, I&#39;m dancing like a chicken.
 <br>
 Ever since I said I like Randy, Kitty has been stumping around, making life miserable for me.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t describe how bad it is over there.
 <br>
 Well it made you wanna come over and hang out with me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the perfect way to describe it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad you came.
 <br>
 Taste this.
 <br>
 Hum.
 <br>
 That taste&#39;s pretty good.
 <br>
 It&#39;s cause it&#39;s made with 5 different cheeses ! What&#39;s it called ? Oh, save room for cheese cake.
 <br>
 God this place looks great.
 <br>
 WB will never know we had a party.
 <br>
 You missed something behind the couch.
 <br>
 Drive safe.
 <br>
 You know, all this cleaning is actually kind of satisfying.
 <br>
 I bet my maid is thrilled she&#39;s not a doctor in her country anymore.
 <br>
 Well, I cleaned up that dirty limbrick of the wall.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know where this Notucket place is but the men there are disgusting.
 <br>
 Man, I should not have thrown a party here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird but I feel kinda guilty.
 <br>
 I never felt guilty before in my life.
 <br>
 Even when the judge said &#34; you&#39;re guilty.
 <br>
 &#34; You think that&#39;s weird ? I  took my pants off but my undies are gone.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna believe this, but I  think I&#39;m wearing them.
 <br>
 Hey, what the hell is the guitar doing on the floor ? Oh you took it down to whack all the women in the bum with it.
 <br>
 Hum hum.
 <br>
 You called it Hyde&#39;s Spankomatic.
 <br>
 Well, it looks alright.
 <br>
 What are you talking about ? It&#39;s broken into pieces.
 <br>
 Ok, so we should probably say goodnight here because if my dad saw us kissing, he&#39;ll yell Yoo Hoo ! Oh look at this, Randy and Donna kissing.
 <br>
 Yoo Hoo ! Well I think I shouldn&#39;t get too upset because after all it&#39;s none of my business what two people do in the privacy of my own drive-way.
 <br>
 Mrs Forman, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re uncomfortable but for the last time, Eric broke up with me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 You should still be waiting for him.
 <br>
 When Red went to war, I waited for him, and I had more men coming after me than Hitler ! That&#39;s different ! Eric chose to go to Africa and he chose to break up with me.
 <br>
 Well, maybe he wouldn&#39;t have left if you were a better girlfriend.
 <br>
 well, maybe if you hadn&#39;t been so smothering and controlling him, he wouldn&#39;t have gone half way across the world just to get away from you.
 <br>
 Eh, that egg shell does look like me ! Hey handsome.
 <br>
 Red, do one more.
 <br>
 What am I now ? A deer.
 <br>
 No, a rhinoceros.
 <br>
 What I am now ? A moron.
 <br>
 Wrong again, I&#39;m a deer ! Mr Forman, your wife just saw me and Randy kissing in the drive-way.
 <br>
 Yoo Hoo.
 <br>
 Then she yelled at us, so I told her she was a bad mother and that Eric went to Africa to get away from her.
 <br>
 Now she&#39;s really mad at me.
 <br>
 Well, of course, she&#39;s mad at you Donna.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t just go around telling people the truth.
 <br>
 Why in the hell didn&#39;t you stop them ? Because the last time I got between two women, well, that actually worked out very well.
 <br>
 Well, thanks Donna.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;ve made it worse.
 <br>
 I have to go and fix this now.
 <br>
 Because if I have to stay here another day with your dad, I&#39;m gonna end up killing myself.
 <br>
 No offence.
 <br>
 How was that no offence ? You should have just said offence.
 <br>
 Fine, offence.
 <br>
 OK, go but you&#39;re gonna miss out on what I&#39;m doing for dinner: This thing is completely destroyed.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know what else happened at the party ? A guy grabbed my butt and his girlfriend got very mad at them.
 <br>
 You know, I think they broke up.
 <br>
 I had a great time.
 <br>
 I&#39;m screwed, man.
 <br>
 WB is in the music industry.
 <br>
 They can kill anyone and make it look like an accident.
 <br>
 They did it to Mama Kass, they did it to Hendrix, they even took out Bobby Holly, they got the big bumper.
 <br>
 Oh Hyde, you&#39;re such a baby ! Oh I&#39;m Hyde and I just lost the trust of the father I just met.
 <br>
 Oh, here comes the waterfall again.
 <br>
 Oh, I hear you and Donna had quite a fight.
 <br>
 You wanna tell me what happened ? well, your guess is as good as mine.
 <br>
 I saw Donna and Randy in the drive-way, I politely said Good day and out of nowhere she just bit my head off.
 <br>
 - Completely unprovoked ? - Completely.
 <br>
 - So just like all of our fights.
 <br>
 - Exactly.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, look Kitty.
 <br>
 What happened with Eric and Donna is normal.
 <br>
 People, people move away, they move on.
 <br>
 Just like you did when I went off to war and you dated Roger Silver.
 <br>
 You knew about that ? Well you guys should probably not have gone on America&#39;s Band stage.
 <br>
 Well my situation was different.
 <br>
 You were overseas, I had to keep my options open.
 <br>
 Donna is a whore.
 <br>
 What do you think, man.
 <br>
 Can you fix it ? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 You kinda caught me at a bad time.
 <br>
 Right in the middle of Hawai 5-0.
 <br>
 Leo, there is no TV in here.
 <br>
 That doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s on.
 <br>
 Look, man, I actually really need your help.
 <br>
 OK, I can fix this, man.
 <br>
 But I just need to do one thing to prepare.
 <br>
 OK here we go, gloves, knife, napkin.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t fix a guitar in an empty stomach.
 <br>
 Oh, hi Donna.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t recognize you without a 6 feet stranger boy attached to your face.
 <br>
 Mrs Forman, about what happened in the drive-way, we both said some things we probably didn&#39;t mean.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Oh I&#39;m just saying.
 <br>
 We both got emotional and we said some things we might want to take back.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t think of anything.
 <br>
 But you do admit you were on the drive-way, right ? I don&#39;t know, it looks more like a brothel to me.
 <br>
 Mrs Forman, please.
 <br>
 I just came over here to tell you that the whole thing with Randy, it was all a huge mistake.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna.
 <br>
 I am so happy to hear you say that.
 <br>
 So are you and I okay ? Of course we are ! Ohhh.
 <br>
 I never really saw you with Randy anyway, he&#39;s awful handsome.
 <br>
 Oh, no, we&#39;re still together.
 <br>
 We just won&#39;t kiss in front of you anymore.
 <br>
 And for the record, I can get any guy I want.
 <br>
 I am damn hot.
 <br>
 You should hear the disgusting things construction workers say they wanna do to me.
 <br>
 Oh come on Donna.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t belong with Randy anyway and just wait when Eric gets home Mrs Forman listen to me.
 <br>
 When Eric comes back we are not going back together.
 <br>
 So  you need to get over it.
 <br>
 How am I supposed to get over Eric running off to Africa.
 <br>
 he was supposed to stay here, marry you and and give me and Red 3 wonderful grandchildren named Ronald, Rose and Kitty Junior.
 <br>
 Only everyone would call her Kitkat so that it doesn&#39;t get confusing.
 <br>
 Oh my god.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re not mad at me, you&#39;re mad at Eric.
 <br>
 Of course I&#39;m mad at Eric.
 <br>
 It just wasn&#39;t supposed to turn out this way.
 <br>
 Mrs Forman, I&#39;ll always care about Eric but, it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 S oo Kitty Junior ? Or Kitty the second.
 <br>
 Whichever you prefer.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your child.
 <br>
 There you go, the guitar is all fixed.
 <br>
 Leo, I could kiss you, man.
 <br>
 Ok, but that&#39;s as far as you gonna get.
 <br>
 Hey, where is my kiss ? I&#39;m the one who whipped off all the graffiti.
 <br>
 What ? Yeah, some jerk named Peter Frampton wrote his name on it.
 <br>
 Fez ! You moron, this is Peter Frampton&#39;s guitar.
 <br>
 - Who ? - Peter Frampton.
 <br>
 The talentless idiot that a million brainless teenage girls made a star ?! I love Peter Frampton ! A million and one.
 <br>
 Oh my god, my dad&#39;s here.
 <br>
 What am I going to do ? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of him with this ! Hands down, you son of a bitch ! You now what, I&#39;ll sign it myself.
 <br>
 Peter Frampton&#39;s wrote on many things.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just leave the sucks part.
 <br>
 - Hey there Steven ! - Hey man, how was Clapton ? Great.
 <br>
 I got you a T-shirt.
 <br>
 &#34;I love Chicago.
 <br>
 &#34; I didn&#39;t remember tilI got to the airport.
 <br>
 Wow, look at this place.
 <br>
 You know I was thinking I was gonna give you a nice cash bonus but now I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re not ? - No, check this out ! Eric Clapton signed this guitar.
 <br>
 - Oh my God, I love Clapton.
 <br>
 - Me too ! That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving you the Peter Frampton.
 <br>
 Actually, you know, the store is going great, you took care of the house so here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re giving me the Clapton guitar ? Yeah, you deserve it.
 <br>
 Ohhh, yeah.
 <br>
 WB I got something bad to tell you.
 <br>
 Well, actually it&#39;s kind of funny too.
 <br>
 No it&#39;s mostly bad.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;d say 50-50 funny bad.
 <br>
 I threw the most freaking awesome party here last night and well, we broke your Frampton guitar.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the funny part ? Well I was hoping that was the funny part because I put the &#34;ah ah&#34; in there.
 <br>
 It made me laugh.
 <br>
 So while I was away, you disobeyed my wishes, you used my house for a party and broke something that was extremely valuable to me ? I have a son ! - You&#39;re not mad ? - No, of course not.
 <br>
 Do I still get the Clapton guitar ? Oh hell, no.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t trust you worth a damn.
 <br>
 I have a confession to make too.
 <br>
 I broke your toilet seat trying to reheat some pizza.
 <br>
 Yeah and I peed in your pool.
 <br>
 Leo, you weren&#39;t even at the party.
 <br>
 I know that&#39;s why I peed in his pool.
 <br>
 Towel, succion, ohhh We&#39;re losing him.
 <br>
 Time of death, Murdererrrrrrr !
 <br>
