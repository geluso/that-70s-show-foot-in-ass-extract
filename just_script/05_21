<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 I&#39;m telling you, the government has a car that runs on water, man.
 <br>
 They just don&#39;t want us to know, because then we&#39;d buy all the water.
 <br>
 Then there&#39;d be nothing left to drink but beer.
 <br>
 And the government knows that beer will set us free.
 <br>
 Hyde, you told us about the car a million times.
 <br>
 Can we please talk about how hungry and horny I am? I wish I had a lady made of pizza.
 <br>
 Or a pizza made of boobs! Yeah, hungry, check.
 <br>
 Horny, check.
 <br>
 It&#39;s getting a little old, Fez.
 <br>
 God, I feel like I&#39;m Luke Skywalker, you know? Remember when he was living on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up? Just workin&#39; on Uncle Owen&#39;s water farm all day.
 <br>
 Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station to pick up some power converters.
 <br>
 Boring.
 <br>
 Eric, enough with the Star Wars crap! Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown.
 <br>
 And when I frown, my skin wrinkles.
 <br>
 And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over.
 <br>
 And I like my free ride! Yeah, we get it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re good looking.
 <br>
 Look, doesn&#39;t anybody have anything new to say? So there&#39;s this car that runs on water, man.
 <br>
 It runs on water, man! Okay, Nina, I brought you the special.
 <br>
 One small soda, one medium popcorn and one large Fez, dark and sweet.
 <br>
 Fez, you know I&#39;ve had a lot of fun hanging out with you.
 <br>
 Hey, 37 times of fun, to be exact.
 <br>
 It would&#39;ve been 38, but you know- And then again, I apologize.
 <br>
 Now enjoy your meal.
 <br>
 If you need me, I&#39;ll be smelling your neck.
 <br>
 Fe-Fez, I&#39;m starting to feel like I need some space.
 <br>
 But I want you to know it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, I guess tonight I&#39;ll be doing number 12,377 of the other thing.
 <br>
 That&#39;s sort of gross.
 <br>
 Hey, it may be gross, but that&#39;s the way I learned how to count.
 <br>
 ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] Six Million Dollar Man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s like a $20 jumpsuit and a $4 haircut.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 Where did all the money go? I think we&#39;ve seen this episode.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And we were sitting in these exact same seats when we saw it.
 <br>
 Actually, you were sitting over there.
 <br>
 I remember, &#39;cause I could see up your skirt.
 <br>
 You guys, we do the exact same thing every day.
 <br>
 TV, snack, nap.
 <br>
 It&#39;s- You know what? This isn&#39;t a basement.
 <br>
 This is a nursing home.
 <br>
 I know something new we could do.
 <br>
 Jackie, Donna, get naked.
 <br>
 The rest of you guys back off and give us some room.
 <br>
 - Hello, friends of Fez.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Nina? She don&#39;t wanna hang out with me tonight.
 <br>
 She said she needed space.
 <br>
 - [All] Ooh! - Uh-oh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the same sound you guys made when I told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.
 <br>
 Fez, when a girl says she needs space, that means that she&#39;s dumping you.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 She said it was her and not me.
 <br>
 - [All] Oh! - That ain&#39;t good.
 <br>
 - Oh, what&#39;s the big deal? - Oh, man, I can&#39;t tell him.
 <br>
 This is a job for someone who&#39;s cold, heartless and just inhuman.
 <br>
 Jackie, go for it.
 <br>
 Fez, when a girl says, &#34;It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me&#34; what she really means is it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 - So I have really been dumped.
 <br>
 - [Hyde] Yep.
 <br>
 And here&#39;s another tip.
 <br>
 When a girl says she just wants to be friends it means she wants you to do stuff for her, but she&#39;s not gonna put out.
 <br>
 So, you know, heads-up on that one.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Women&#39;ll screw you over every chance they get.
 <br>
 That and breast-feeding.
 <br>
 It just comes natural to &#39;em.
 <br>
 So, Hadji&#39;s girlfriend finally came to her senses.
 <br>
 What happened? She didn&#39;t wanna be a fifth wife? [Laughing] - Hadji.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s her loss.
 <br>
 The girls in my Friday night cribbage game will be thrilled to have Fez back at the table.
 <br>
 You know what? At least Fez has a social life.
 <br>
 Look at us.
 <br>
 We&#39;re hanging out with my parents.
 <br>
 Yeah, about that.
 <br>
 Feel free to get the hell out.
 <br>
 Well, we can do better than this.
 <br>
 You guys, we&#39;re gonna graduate in two months and there is a whole town out there just waiting for us.
 <br>
 We just have to, you know, grab the bull by the horns.
 <br>
 Okay, but I tell you this from experience.
 <br>
 If we&#39;re gonna mess with the bull, we better have an escape plan.
 <br>
 Well, what are the popular kids doing tonight? Well, I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re not hanging around with their parents giving them snarky looks.
 <br>
 I remember when the Brady kids got bored and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] It just all turned around.
 <br>
 They got in a pie fight and everything.
 <br>
 You know what? Kelso might actually be onto something.
 <br>
 Maybe we should look for someone new to hang out with.
 <br>
 All right! We&#39;re gettin&#39; a fat kid! You know, instead of adding someone maybe you should think about weeding out a few.
 <br>
 Like you and you and you.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m your son.
 <br>
 - I can&#39;t play favorites.
 <br>
 You know, if you&#39;re looking for a new friend, how about Lance Crawford? He&#39;s such a nice boy.
 <br>
 Mom, Lance Crawford and I hate each other.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just obsessed with getting his mother&#39;s peach cobbler recipe.
 <br>
 Well, what kind of a woman keeps a recipe a secret? If that recipe were the polio vaccine, we&#39;d all be in wheelchairs! I don&#39;t like Lance Crawford.
 <br>
 He&#39;s always staring at me in this really creepy way.
 <br>
 And this one time, I saw him fiddling around in my locker.
 <br>
 When I opened it, there was a rose inside, and my gym socks were missing.
 <br>
 Donna, a little advice.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna want those socks back.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t think of anyone new I wanna hang out with.
 <br>
 All the girls I know are either too snobby or too slutty.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m not good with the snobs, but slutty&#39;s my bread and butter.
 <br>
 You know, what we need are people with stuff to offer, like Mark Herman.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got that dirt bike.
 <br>
 I always liked him.
 <br>
 - Sold it last week.
 <br>
 - That punk.
 <br>
 He&#39;s out.
 <br>
 Hey, Carrie Gerber has a trampoline.
 <br>
 Carrie Gerber also has a big, hairy mole.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna be bouncing around and get tangled up in that.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Honey, there&#39;s someone here to see you.
 <br>
 Mom, if it&#39;s another one of Dad&#39;s Marine Corps recruiters, I&#39;m gonna run away.
 <br>
 I swear.
 <br>
 Lance Crawford? Mom! Hello, Eric.
 <br>
 Your father and I were just discussing how unrealistically space travel is portrayed in Star Wars.
 <br>
 It was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
 <br>
 - You either buy it or you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 - What a lively conversation.
 <br>
 [Laughing] - I&#39;ll get some sodas.
 <br>
 - No, please.
 <br>
 Allow me.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you stay here and chat with Mr.
 <br>
 Unrealistic Space Travel.
 <br>
 Yes, I&#39;d love to explain the practical impossibility of the so-called light saber.
 <br>
 You son of a bi- Red alert, you guys.
 <br>
 Red alert! Lance Crawford is in the building! - I&#39;m gettin&#39; the hell outta here! - [Jackie] Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 - What if he sees us sneaking out? - Oh, Donna leave one of your socks behind.
 <br>
 [Groans] What? It&#39;ll distract him.
 <br>
 Nina, I thought we were so happy together.
 <br>
 What happened? Fez, right now I&#39;m at a point in- Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker.
 <br>
 I want the truth! Okay, the truth is you&#39;re too needy.
 <br>
 Too needy? I&#39;m sorry, but a man in his sexual prime has needs.
 <br>
 And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
 <br>
 No, your needs are fine.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your neediness that&#39;s the problem.
 <br>
 - Then why didn&#39;t you say that? - I didn&#39;t want you to make a scene.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t want me to make a scene? You didn&#39;t want me to make a scene? Ha! You dump Fez! I dump fries! There&#39;s your scene! Here&#39;s a dollar.
 <br>
 Sorry about the scene.
 <br>
 Oh, poor Fez.
 <br>
 Too depressed to leave his room.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 You guys, we gotta cheer him up.
 <br>
 - Knock first.
 <br>
 If Fez is alone, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not wearing pants.
 <br>
 Oh, awesome! Wait.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s catch him.
 <br>
 - Oh, wow.
 <br>
 - Wow! Check out all this great stuff.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Is that a race-car bed? - I call shotgun! - Ay! Oh! Fezzie, come on out.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not wearing pants.
 <br>
 Told you! Nina told me why she dumped me.
 <br>
 She said I was too needy.
 <br>
 Am I too needy? Tell me! I need to know! Fez, I&#39;m sorry, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the definition of needy.
 <br>
 Remember, one time, you called me at 3:00 in the morning just to make sure we were still friends? Look, if you wanna get Nina back, you gotta act like you don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 - But I don&#39;t know how to do that.
 <br>
 - Well, we can help you.
 <br>
 Oh! We&#39;ll rebuild you like the Six Million Dollar Man! Fez One to Control.
 <br>
 We have liftoff.
 <br>
 All systems are go.
 <br>
 Proceed to eat candy.
 <br>
 - [Klaxon Blaring] - Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Emergency! Emergency! We are breaking up.
 <br>
 I repeat, Nina and I are breaking up.
 <br>
 [Kelso&#39;s Voice] Fez, a teenager, a boy with needs.
 <br>
 Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
 <br>
 We have the technology.
 <br>
 [Hyde&#39;s Voice] We can make him more appealing to Nina by making him less needy.
 <br>
 [Grunting] We can make him cooler, suaver, aloofer.
 <br>
 &#34;Aloofer&#34;? Is that even a word? We can make it one.
 <br>
 We have the technology.
 <br>
 [Scoffs] - Initiate female reaction sequence.
 <br>
 - Release the girls.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez, looking good.
 <br>
 Love the outfit.
 <br>
 Totally bionic.
 <br>
 You mean nothing to me.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 He&#39;s no longer needy.
 <br>
 And because of that, I want him even more.
 <br>
 [All] Doctor.
 <br>
 Doctor.
 <br>
 Doctor.
 <br>
 - Terrific job.
 <br>
 - [All] Doctor.
 <br>
 Doctor.
 <br>
 Doctor.
 <br>
 - Whoa.
 <br>
 Doctor.
 <br>
 - Whoa.
 <br>
 Doctor.
 <br>
 Oh, I see.
 <br>
 In order to get Nina I have to act like I don&#39;t need her.
 <br>
 Well, fine.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need Nina.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need women.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t need anything! - [All] Oh! Eric sure is taking an awfully long time with those sodas.
 <br>
 [Laughing] I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no reflection on you, Lance.
 <br>
 He probably just wants to make sure a good friend like you gets the freshest soda available.
 <br>
 I know Eric doesn&#39;t like me, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I only came over for the chance to see my beautiful Donna.
 <br>
 And after I make my fortune in robots I&#39;m gonna come back to this Podunk town and buy whatever flour mill Eric is working at fire him, and make Donna my wife.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a creepy kid.
 <br>
 You know that? Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I think we both know the real reason you invited me over here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re after Mother&#39;s coveted peach cobbler recipe, no? Your mom makes peach cobbler? I had no idea.
 <br>
 Please, let&#39;s speak frankly.
 <br>
 I have something you want, and you have something I want.
 <br>
 W-We&#39;re not in a- in a position to just give you Donna.
 <br>
 We could give you Eric.
 <br>
 Mother tasted your stuffing at the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot and ever since then she&#39;s wanted the recipe.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been instructed to arrange a swap.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you have any weird friends to play with? Friends are for the weak.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys.
 <br>
 MeetJulie.
 <br>
 She&#39;s got two horses, a brand-new Firebird and her dad works for Six Flags! [All] Hello, Julie! Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 Love your hair.
 <br>
 You can touch it if you want.
 <br>
 Oh, get lost, skankoid.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all full.
 <br>
 Damn, Jackie! She&#39;s got a Firebird and two horses! We could&#39;ve raced &#39;em! All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go askJake Bradley.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve all been thinking it, but no one&#39;s had the guts to ask him &#39;cause he&#39;s the quarterback, and we&#39;re a bunch of jelly heads.
 <br>
 But you know what I say? I say we shoot for the stars.
 <br>
 And that star is Jake Bradley! Jake Bradley! All right, Fez.
 <br>
 There&#39;s Nina.
 <br>
 Now remember, you&#39;re a new man.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t need her or anything else.
 <br>
 - Got it.
 <br>
 I am cooler, suaver, aloofer.
 <br>
 - There you go.
 <br>
 - Oh, hi, Fez.
 <br>
 - Oh, you wish, baby.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you take your &#34;Hi, Fez&#34; act and try it on someone else? &#39;Cause I don&#39;t need it.
 <br>
 - Nice work, Fez.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need your accolades.
 <br>
 How can you give away your stuffing recipe, Kitty? It&#39;s the one thing that we have that&#39;s better than everyone else&#39;s.
 <br>
 Our house? Crappier.
 <br>
 Our son? Crappier.
 <br>
 Our stuffing? Better! [Groans] Okay, Lance.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 Excellent.
 <br>
 Mother will be most pleased.
 <br>
 Oh, you be sure to say hi.
 <br>
 Such a nice lady.
 <br>
 Please, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, there&#39;s no need to keep up the charade.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 She&#39;s cold.
 <br>
 Get out.
 <br>
 I just want you to know that I don&#39;t need these fries.
 <br>
 I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
 <br>
 Please, just take the fries.
 <br>
 You need me to take them, don&#39;t you? Needy bastard.
 <br>
 Hi, Fez.
 <br>
 Can I talk to you? Oh, you need permission, do you? I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
 <br>
 - Really? - Yes.
 <br>
 I like the new Fez.
 <br>
 - What about the old Fez? - Not so much.
 <br>
 You know what, Nina? There&#39;s only one Fez and that is a Fez with needs.
 <br>
 And if you don&#39;t like that, then we shouldn&#39;t be together.
 <br>
 - But, Fez, l- - Shh! Sorry, baby.
 <br>
 It&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Oh, and, Nina, it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 Ladies ofThe Hub why do we try to act like we have no needs? I have needs.
 <br>
 For instance, I need a date for Saturday night.
 <br>
 Any takers? You, blondie.
 <br>
 You there, with the glasses.
 <br>
 What about the redhead trying to cover her face? Hey.
 <br>
 So I went to see Jake Bradley- You mean- [Imitating Eric] Jake Bradley? Yes.
 <br>
 To see if he wanted to hang out.
 <br>
 And you know what Mr.
 <br>
 Cool Guy was doing? Just hanging out in his basement with his friends and they were watching The Six Million Dollar Man.
 <br>
 It was eerie.
 <br>
 Was there a skinny guy dating this really hot chick who&#39;s way out of his league? You know, there was.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Does this mean we&#39;re not gettin&#39; a fat kid to play with? No, man.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t need anyone else.
 <br>
 You know what? We&#39;ve only got two months until graduation and we can&#39;t waste a second of that.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s seize the day, man.
 <br>
 Hey, weren&#39;t we supposed to seize something, man? You know what the Six Million Dollar Man should have? A bionic nose.
 <br>
 You could smell everything! Guys, all I know is that we should really appreciate this &#39;cause I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna be able to do this in college.
 <br>
 This peach cobbler is amazing! Now, who would leave a whole pan of peach cobbler just sitting on a counter? See? We don&#39;t need anyone else.
 <br>
 We have lots of interesting things to say.
 <br>
 Right? Hey, there&#39;s this car that runs on water.
 <br>
 It runs on water, man! - [Laughing] - [Imitating Engine Revving] Careful.
 <br>
 I know it looks like a race car, but it&#39;s really a bed.
 <br>
 Please don&#39;t make a mess.
 <br>
 The maid doesn&#39;t come until Thursday.
 <br>
 Watch it! That is a present from my cousin in Hong Kong.
 <br>
 Who has been dropping Milk Duds on my carpet? Who has been dropping Milk Duds on my carpet? Screw this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to Eric&#39;s.
 <br>
 [Jackie Yells, Laughs]
