 Happy Veteran&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 Now where have you hidden the chocolate eggs? Uh, they&#39;re everywhere, Fez.
 <br>
 Start looking.
 <br>
 So, Steven.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t Veteran&#39;s Day romantic? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Government pawns and missing limbs.
 <br>
 That&#39;s amore.
 <br>
 I know, I know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a day for people in love to have fun together.
 <br>
 You know what? All this talk about having fun makes me want to have fun.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s throw stuff at other stuff.
 <br>
 Man, that&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got stuff.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 - Let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 So, Steven.
 <br>
 Would you like to go to Mr.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s barbecue with me? No.
 <br>
 - As a matter of fact, I don&#39;t want to go anywhere with you.
 <br>
 - You know, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You know what? We can stay in.
 <br>
 No, Jackie.
 <br>
 Look, I told you, again and again I have no interest in you, and you don&#39;t have a chance.
 <br>
 And yet, you keep thinking that I have interest in you, and you have a chance.
 <br>
 Wait, did you just say that you&#39;re interested in me and that I have a chance? Okay.
 <br>
 You know what? You&#39;ve forced me to do this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna explain my feelings to you through a highly disciplined form ofJapanese poetry haiku.
 <br>
 My heart aches with pain.
 <br>
 When I see you, I vomit.
 <br>
 Die away from me.
 <br>
 Ouch.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Sayonara.
 <br>
 Donna, never have 17 syllables hurt me so much.
 <br>
 Why would he want to hurt me like that? Because you&#39;re stalking him, Jackie.
 <br>
 - No, really, Donna.
 <br>
 - Jackie, really.
 <br>
 You are to Hyde what Fez is to you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s ridiculous.
 <br>
 Fez and I will never happen.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Steven and I will never happen.
 <br>
 Jackie, it&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 You just gotta get over this and be strong.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, Donna.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Oh, how I wish my daddy could buy him for me.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 This smell like chocolate to you? Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Paul Stanley from KISS.
 <br>
 Kelso, don&#39;t play with the cheese.
 <br>
 These damn kids.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t respect anything American.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, this isn&#39;t about the kids misusing dairy products.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still upset that Bob marched in the Veteran&#39;s Day parade.
 <br>
 Well, he was only in the National Guard.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called Veteran&#39;s Day not Pansy-ass, National Guard Wussy, Pansy-ass Day.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Red.
 <br>
 Are any dirty Commies less dead because of him? No, I guess not.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, Kitty.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m gonna put away this uniform, and then we&#39;ll fire up that grill.
 <br>
 Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Some parade, huh? Yeah, sure was, till the National Guard got there.
 <br>
 Look, I just came over to invite you to my barbecue.
 <br>
 Your barbecue? Bob, I have an annual barbecue every Veteran&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my day because I&#39;m a veteran.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m a veteran too.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m having a barbecue, and you can&#39;t stop me.
 <br>
 Hey, Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, I didn&#39;t know you were in the Boy Scouts.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody.
 <br>
 This is Chip.
 <br>
 He&#39;s been after me for a while now, so I just said, &#34;What the hell?&#34; - Chip, it&#39;s everybody.
 <br>
 - Hey, everybody.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;ll, uh, get you something to drink.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re with this Chip guy now? - Yep.
 <br>
 - Huh.
 <br>
 Why? Do you care? No, I mean, if you want to date this guy, that&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 It is? And then Steven said, &#34;That&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 &#34; But not like &#34;cool.
 <br>
 &#34; More like he&#39;s jealous.
 <br>
 Jackie, or he just thinks it&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 Donna, it is so romantic.
 <br>
 Just like West Side Story.
 <br>
 Yeah, but without the dancing and the Puerto Ricans.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Is Fez Puerto Rican? You know what? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 This will show Red.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna have the best barbecue ever.
 <br>
 If there&#39;s one thing you learn in the National Guard, it&#39;s how to cook.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m gonna defrost some chicken.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Mom, the Formans have a barbecue every Veteran&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 - I mean, why are we having one? - Honey, this isn&#39;t about a barbecue.
 <br>
 This is about your father going bankrupt.
 <br>
 - Now help me with these chairs.
 <br>
 - What? What are you talking about? We need the chairs for people to sit on.
 <br>
 No, Mom.
 <br>
 About Dad being bankrupt.
 <br>
 Your dad&#39;s appliance store&#39;s going out of business &#39;cause he can&#39;t compete with Price Mart.
 <br>
 So he decided to throw a big barbecue.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m still not getting this.
 <br>
 Oh, your dad wants to be big shot one last time before everybody discovers what a failure he is.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 - And please don&#39;t tell anybody.
 <br>
 He&#39;s very sensitive about being a failure.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 Enjoy your burger.
 <br>
 And thank you for choosing the Formans for your Veteran&#39;s Day celebration needs.
 <br>
 Kitty, why is everybody over at Bob&#39;s? They&#39;ve got chicken.
 <br>
 Chicken? Well, isn&#39;t that a surprise? A National Guardsman serving up chicken.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not gonna get away with this.
 <br>
 Eric, chop up some onions and mix it in with the meat.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t we just put the onions on top of the burger? Eric, do you want to win this thing or don&#39;t you? Okay, not-crazy Dad.
 <br>
 - Eric, can I talk to you? - Uh, not really, Donna.
 <br>
 I got to bust hump.
 <br>
 - My dad wants to crush your dad&#39;s barbecue.
 <br>
 - What? Why? Well, apparently, my dad believes that if your dad&#39;s barbecue is better than his America will fall to the Russkies.
 <br>
 Did you ever stop to think that maybe my dad&#39;s barbecue is really important to him? Uh, no.
 <br>
 Because it&#39;s just a stupid barbecue.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not stupid.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sick of your dad.
 <br>
 He&#39;s such a jerk.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s a jerk? Well, Donna, your dad&#39;s a jerk, and he&#39;s just copying my dad.
 <br>
 And your dad didn&#39;t even fight in the war.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just a National Guard kid.
 <br>
 Yeah, I said it.
 <br>
 What? What? Oh, yeah? Well, you and Red are going down.
 <br>
 And you know what else? I was wrong, Eric.
 <br>
 Red&#39;s not a jerk.
 <br>
 He&#39;s an ass, and you&#39;re an ass.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause the ass doesn&#39;t fall far from the ass tree.
 <br>
 &#34;What did I say, what?&#34; Man, I can&#39;t believeJackie chose that guy over me.
 <br>
 - Or me for that matter.
 <br>
 - Yeah, that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you&#39;re a good-looking guy.
 <br>
 Back at you, Kelso.
 <br>
 Your eyelashes, they go for, like, miles.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve heard that.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m what&#39;s known as &#34;man-pretty.
 <br>
 &#34; Bad news, Dad.
 <br>
 The Pinciottis have these.
 <br>
 Red, white and blue napkins? That clever S.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 And I cheaped out and went for the plain white.
 <br>
 So what, now we surrender? Surrender? You know, if this were an actual war, you&#39;d be the first in a body bag.
 <br>
 Yes, sir.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go refill the ketchups.
 <br>
 Schlitz.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s that hot guy you brought with you? Back off! I need him for right now but you can have him when I&#39;m done, as usual.
 <br>
 Wait a second, Jackie.
 <br>
 Are you working an angle here? Nice.
 <br>
 No, there&#39;s no angle.
 <br>
 I just want to see if I can make Steven jealous.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re gonna sleep with him a couple of times and see what happens.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I&#39;ve been down that road.
 <br>
 - No! Oh, you&#39;re such a child.
 <br>
 Send him to my room when you&#39;re done.
 <br>
 - So, you and Jackie, huh? - Yeah, isn&#39;t she something? - Sure.
 <br>
 - Sometimes, though, I kind of hate it when she talks.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I hear you.
 <br>
 And she&#39;s always talking.
 <br>
 But, I figure it&#39;s worth it if I can nail her.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Yeah, you should probably think about that, man.
 <br>
 You know, I mean, Jackie&#39;s kind of young.
 <br>
 - She only had, like, one boyfriend, so- - Hey, that&#39;s not a big surprise.
 <br>
 You know, she&#39;s a bitch.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 - Steven, what happened? - What? Nothing.
 <br>
 Just somebody-And then the guy said &#34;bitch,&#34; and there&#39;s nothing.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 He called me a bitch? And you hit him.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s what happened, isn&#39;t it? No.
 <br>
 Liar.
 <br>
 I am the bitch, and you love me.
 <br>
 Stop staring at me.
 <br>
 Quit it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not this guy.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, I saw what happened.
 <br>
 Is your girlfriend okay? My girlfriend? Yeah, the-the bossy, little, mean one you&#39;re always hanging around with.
 <br>
 - Oh, uh, Jackie.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s not my girlfriend.
 <br>
 Are you sure? Yes, I&#39;m sure.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like her.
 <br>
 She&#39;s shallow and rich and mean and bossy.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s everything that I hate.
 <br>
 - But, Steven, you hate everything.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s that supposed to mean? - Well, it means that maybe you like her &#39;cause I kind of think you do.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 How could I like her? Because I don&#39;t like her.
 <br>
 Because I can&#39;t like her.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, if I like her, shoot me.
 <br>
 Pow! Jackie, get your car.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going on a freakin&#39; date.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a Veteran&#39;s Day miracle.
 <br>
 [Man Singing Rock] Red, white and blue cheeseburgers.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re a genius.
 <br>
 Voilà.
 <br>
 Sparkler dogs.
 <br>
 God bless America.
 <br>
 - Freshly squeezed.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s fresh.
 <br>
 Ah, beer in the bottle.
 <br>
 That&#39;s class.
 <br>
 - The keg is tapped.
 <br>
 - Bend over and kiss it good-bye, Bob.
 <br>
 Here comes the big one.
 <br>
 [Laughing] A keg? Oh, great.
 <br>
 Red&#39;s gone nuclear.
 <br>
 - This barbecue is over.
 <br>
 - [Ends] Dad, that&#39;s it? You&#39;re just gonna give up? We had sparkler dogs.
 <br>
 We could win this thing.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Donna, thanks.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 I just wanted one big blowout.
 <br>
 One last hurrah, you know? Oh, why didn&#39;t I rent the one-man band? [Radio: Ballad] This is the best date ever.
 <br>
 Jackie, we haven&#39;t talked in 30 minutes.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Steven, you don&#39;t have to say anything.
 <br>
 I understand you.
 <br>
 - [Scoffs] Oh, you do, do you? - Sure.
 <br>
 Okay, so you&#39;re probably sitting there thinking &#34;I&#39;m on this date with this girl &#34;who really, really likes me.
 <br>
 And she&#39;s so beautiful.
 <br>
 &#34; - Jackie.
 <br>
 - Hush.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re wondering &#34;How can I open up to her &#34;when everyone I have ever loved have abandoned me? Am I even worthy of love?&#34; Well, you are, Steven.
 <br>
 You are.
 <br>
 [Sobs] It&#39;s okay, Steven.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Know what? Let it out.
 <br>
 - Let it all out.
 <br>
 - [Sobbing] Okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 [Raspberry] - Let&#39;s go home.
 <br>
 - Oh, come on.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 No, this is all right.
 <br>
 We can hang out here for a while, okay? God.
 <br>
 Here, have some of my pop.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Okay.
 <br>
 - Well, we&#39;ve gone through three batches of ambrosia salad.
 <br>
 - Three batches! Not since D-day has there been such a complete and glorious victory.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] Oh, hi, Donna.
 <br>
 Well, I hope you&#39;re all happy.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you ruined my dad&#39;s barbecue.
 <br>
 All he wanted was one more good day before everybody found out that his store was closing, and he&#39;s going bankrupt.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 What? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Bargain Bob&#39;s is closing this week so congratulations.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I feel so bad.
 <br>
 Well, you should.
 <br>
 You ruined his barbecue.
 <br>
 Why would you do that? What? Me? You were- Eric, for God&#39;s sakes, the man is almost a veteran.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You know what? Fine.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all my fault.
 <br>
 But, Dad, you, you gotta make everyone here go next door.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 We have got to go over there.
 <br>
 They are our neighbors.
 <br>
 They are our best friends.
 <br>
 Yeah, I suppose.
 <br>
 All right, freeloaders.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s move it on over to Bob&#39;s.
 <br>
 - Eric, grab that keg.
 <br>
 - Okay, I&#39;m on it.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s everybody doing here? Congratulations, Bob, you really out-barbecued me.
 <br>
 I gotta say.
 <br>
 You&#39;re one hell of a guy.
 <br>
 Oh, Bob.
 <br>
 We just love you so much.
 <br>
 - Midge, you told.
 <br>
 - [Nervous Laughter] Look, Bob.
 <br>
 I just want you to know that you&#39;ve been a real good neighbor and a real good friend.
 <br>
 And if you ever need it, I&#39;m here for you.
 <br>
 Thanks, Red.
 <br>
 Oh, but, uh I can&#39;t help you if you cry, Bob.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t cry.
 <br>
 - These are tears of joy, Red.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s bad too, Bob.
 <br>
 [Sobbing] Move! Come on.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Oh, hey.
 <br>
 What&#39;s up? Hi.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Look, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Everyone came by, and I know you did that so thanks.
 <br>
 No, Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Look, you know that I wouldn&#39;t have acted like such a jerk if I knew something so terrible was happening to your dad.
 <br>
 No, I know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - My folks didn&#39;t want me to say anything, so.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 No, I mean.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Are you okay? Yeah, and no.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 [Radio: Ballad] So our first date&#39;s almost over.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 What&#39;d you think? It was no worse than bowling.
 <br>
 L- I don&#39;t hate bowling.
 <br>
 [Ballad Continues] - [Record Scratches, StoPs] - Huh.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t feel anything.
 <br>
 - Nothing? - No, I mean, the kiss was hot, but- Well, did you feel something? Uh, no.
 <br>
 Well, no.
 <br>
 [Ballad Resumes] So I guess that&#39;s it then.
 <br>
 Turns out you were right about us all along.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 So what happens now? I&#39;m not opposed to doing it.
 <br>
 Take me home, you pig.
 <br>
 Yes, dear.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t feel so good.
 <br>
 Me neither.
 <br>
 You see a horse? - Yes, I do.
 <br>
 - Is it pink? Uh-huh.
 <br>
 This was the best barbecue ever.
 <br>
