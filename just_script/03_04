<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 [TV: Organ] Boo! Damn it, Fez! [Sighs] Oh! Damn, Fez.
 <br>
 Fez, what the hell are you doing? Yeah, I don&#39;t know if you know this but you&#39;re dressed like a girl.
 <br>
 And not a nice girl.
 <br>
 Kelso, you spilled juice all over your shirt.
 <br>
 - You look stupid.
 <br>
 - [Eric] Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, while you&#39;re over there, would you Please, Please toss Fez a Pair of Pants? Or at least a skirt.
 <br>
 No, I am Dr.
 <br>
 Frank-N-Furter from The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
 <br>
 You know, my Bible-thumping host parents were really upset about my rock-hard ass.
 <br>
 Fez, put it away or take it outside.
 <br>
 So, Eric, do you wanna get out of here? - Do something fun for Halloween? - I do.
 <br>
 I gotta go to this stupid Halloween party with Laurie&#39;s stupid friends.
 <br>
 Not only do I have to wear a suit but all of her guy friends act like they&#39;ve done it with her before.
 <br>
 - Uh, Kelso- - Leave it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing to do.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we&#39;re too old to trick or treat and too young to die.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, we could take Fez to Chicago and peddle his ass for beer.
 <br>
 I&#39;m game.
 <br>
 No, Eric, I meant maybe there&#39;s something, you know, we could do.
 <br>
 Together.
 <br>
 - [Snorts] I doubt it.
 <br>
 - Oh! That is a burn.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 What? - No, l- No, I didn&#39;t- I didn&#39;t mean it like that.
 <br>
 Nope, sorry, Eric, that was a burn.
 <br>
 And what&#39;s burnt is burnt.
 <br>
 And what&#39;s burnt is Donna.
 <br>
 We&#39;re out of fun things to do? You&#39;re already bored of your girlfriend? No, I meant this town not you, pretty lady.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what&#39;d be fun? Is if we were in an Alfred Hitchcock movie right now and we didn&#39;t know it, and then someone told us and we&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, man, I&#39;m in a movie.
 <br>
 &#34; - Yeah, okay, I&#39;m outta here.
 <br>
 - Wait, but I thought we- - Get bent.
 <br>
 - Okay, I&#39;ll do that.
 <br>
 You know what will cheer you up? A little trick-or-treating.
 <br>
 Hello? Stop bouncing that damn ball and let&#39;s do something.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know, I can&#39;t, Fez, &#39;cause I can&#39;t even look at you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know whether to throw you out or throw you down and make sweet love to you.
 <br>
 You know, that says more about you than it does him.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not the one dressed like a damn girl.
 <br>
 Well, the damn girl has your ball.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] - Like I care about a- - [TV: Organ] Man, that&#39;s my ball.
 <br>
 Oh, these heels are killing me.
 <br>
 Okay, Fez, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Give the ball back, and no one gets hurt.
 <br>
 - [Grunts] - [Screams] Hey, you guys, you wanna go outside and watch Eric and Fez run around? Someone might get hurt.
 <br>
 It&#39;s funny when people get hurt.
 <br>
 Especially when they&#39;re in their underwear.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 The only person dumb enough to get hurt around here is you.
 <br>
 [Snorts] Okay, Jackie, I&#39;m really starting to get sick- [Screaming] That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give you the ball, Eric.
 <br>
 Just don&#39;t fall.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want anyone to fall.
 <br>
 No falling.
 <br>
 [Screams, Grunts] Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Okay, Fez.
 <br>
 Well you got a bad sprain here.
 <br>
 Not to- to mention a run in your stocking.
 <br>
 [Laughs] So, you were running around chasing him on the roof because he took your little rubber ball.
 <br>
 It wasn&#39;t a ball.
 <br>
 It was a SuperBall.
 <br>
 Yeah, you should see that thing bounce.
 <br>
 It&#39;s pretty super.
 <br>
 Dumb-asses.
 <br>
 Steven, Eric, um, get Fez a blanket.
 <br>
 He needs to cover his- He just- He needs to cover up.
 <br>
 [Gasping] [Screaming] Get off me, you girl.
 <br>
 - What-What happened? - Honey, you just- you had a little touch of vertigo there.
 <br>
 So, just stay away from heights for a while and you&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Oh, see? You see that, Jackie? Fez hurt himself.
 <br>
 There is someone &#34;stupider&#34; than me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not his fault he&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 He&#39;s foreign.
 <br>
 What&#39;s your excuse, stupid? Well, I know one thing&#39;s for sure.
 <br>
 There&#39;s definitely someone bitchier than me.
 <br>
 Oh, you better not mean me.
 <br>
 Oh, I so mean you! - Oh.
 <br>
 - Nice burn.
 <br>
 - Top shelf.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 Well, now, that&#39;s strange.
 <br>
 Midge&#39;s car&#39;s right there.
 <br>
 Bob said she wasn&#39;t home.
 <br>
 In fact, I haven&#39;t seen her for days.
 <br>
 Maybe she went to the store and forgot where she lived.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s- that&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Okay, Fez, this&#39;ll cheer you up.
 <br>
 With these you can look into the Pinciotti&#39;s house and frequently enjoy a naked Midge, up close and personal.
 <br>
 That&#39;s exactly how I like my naked Midges.
 <br>
 Oh, but, Fez, be warned.
 <br>
 If Bob approaches a naked Midge, look away.
 <br>
 Oh, for the love of God, look away.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s practice.
 <br>
 Naked Midge, naked Midge, naked Midge - naked Midge, Bob.
 <br>
 - Ay.
 <br>
 - Okay, I think you&#39;re gonna be okay.
 <br>
 - [Chuckles] No, okay.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Bye-bye.
 <br>
 Red, I need you to take this soup up to Fez.
 <br>
 No, Kitty.
 <br>
 He&#39;s wearing ladies&#39; underwear.
 <br>
 So, uh, no.
 <br>
 Well, crazy bird lady from next door called me.
 <br>
 Her bingo cruise got stuck out on Lake Michigan so she asked me to feed her birds.
 <br>
 So, you have a choice.
 <br>
 Feed the birds, or feed the Fez.
 <br>
 Give me panty boy&#39;s damn soup.
 <br>
 Hello, pretty birds.
 <br>
 Hello, pretty damn big birds.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] It&#39;s your Aunt Kitty.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 [Squawks] [Gasps] [Cawing] [Cawing Continues] Hey.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;ve seen this one.
 <br>
 Those guys think that Cary Grant&#39;s a secret agent, but he&#39;s not.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a case of mistaken identity.
 <br>
 Right, like you&#39;ve mistaken me for someone who wants you here.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 - [Chuckles] Wait.
 <br>
 - [Doorbell Rings] - Oh, kick back.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 - No, it&#39;s the paperboy.
 <br>
 - [Ringing Continues] - Well, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, you have to answer the door.
 <br>
 Look, I forgot to pay him for the last couple of weeks and I didn&#39;t pick up any cash, so, just ignore him.
 <br>
 Red, I don&#39;t think you understand, okay? - L- I can&#39;t let a doorbell go unanswered.
 <br>
 - [Ringing Continues] - Don&#39;t answer the damn door.
 <br>
 - I gotta.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t.
 <br>
 - But I gotta.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You pay him, kettlehead.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman.
 <br>
 I want my money.
 <br>
 Oh, l- Oh.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no Formans here.
 <br>
 See for yourself.
 <br>
 Then why does it say Forman on your shirt? Oh, I borrowed the shirt.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a bunch of bullcorn, Forman.
 <br>
 Now, give me my money.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not Forman.
 <br>
 All right, look.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re taking this paperboy thing a little too serious? I&#39;m a very serious paperboy.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what this is? This is a case of mistaken identity.
 <br>
 See, you are mistaken about my identity.
 <br>
 Fork it over, Forman! Look, someone&#39;s stealing your bike.
 <br>
 All right, there&#39;s two guys stupider than me.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Any sign of naked Midge yet? - No.
 <br>
 Just Bob dragging in big, heavy garbage bags.
 <br>
 What do you suppose is in &#39;em? Oh, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m guessing garbage.
 <br>
 - Or- You know how Mrs.
 <br>
 Kitty said she hasn&#39;t seen Midge in a few days? What if naked Midge is in the bags? Red.
 <br>
 Red, I killed a bird.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 And then-And then the rest of them, they just- they glared at me with this- this birdie hate look.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t go back there.
 <br>
 I have got to find somebody else to feed those birds.
 <br>
 Somebody who won&#39;t flinch in the face of evil.
 <br>
 Oh, and there&#39;s Mommy&#39;s girl.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Laurie, have I got a job for you.
 <br>
 - Not interested.
 <br>
 - It pays 10 bucks.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;ll do anything for 10 bucks.
 <br>
 And-And for once, that&#39;s a good thing.
 <br>
 Donna, what&#39;s wrong? You look sad.
 <br>
 I think Eric thinks I&#39;m boring.
 <br>
 Do you think I&#39;m boring? Oh, Donna.
 <br>
 Yeah, a little.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a bad thing.
 <br>
 The world needs people like you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the gray that makes the color- me- pop.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m not boring.
 <br>
 Eric and I do lots of fun stuff together.
 <br>
 We go to movies- Every Friday, early show.
 <br>
 - What? I get sleepy.
 <br>
 - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 [Thinking] Boring, boring, boring.
 <br>
 Boring, boring, boring.
 <br>
 [Screaming] [Screaming] [Screaming] Hey, who&#39;s the hot blonde? [Eric] That&#39;s not a hot blonde.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Donna.
 <br>
 Where is she going? Maybe she&#39;s going trolling for men who don&#39;t piss her off.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] That&#39;s so funny, Hyde.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know where she&#39;s going, but I&#39;m gonna follow her.
 <br>
 [Gasping] [Screaming] [Grunts] Would you stop doing that? [Thuds] [Door Closes] Hey, I don&#39;t know how this fits in your murder theory but Bob&#39;s wearing an apron with guts all over it and holding a big carving knife.
 <br>
 He did kill Midge.
 <br>
 And I never got to see her naked.
 <br>
 [Whirring] [Whirring Continues] [Whirring] [Grunts] [Whirring] [Whirring] [Groans] That&#39;s 2.
 <br>
 50 plus a 50 cent tip &#39;cause I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 See you next week, Forman.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not Forman! First of all, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I&#39;m using your shower.
 <br>
 And second of all, you have to pay your paperboy.
 <br>
 So, how&#39;d it go? Did- Did you feed the birds? Well, uh-Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, I think I did.
 <br>
 Well, either you did or you didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Well, you didn&#39;t either, and you didn&#39;t even get pooped on.
 <br>
 Now, go feed your own stupid birds.
 <br>
 [Thinking] Oh, Hyde, please be careful.
 <br>
 I want you to catch some clues but I don&#39;t want you stuck in the garbage bag with dead, naked Midge.
 <br>
 Oh, beers.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] [Laughs] Hyde is so funny.
 <br>
 Oh-oh, what is he going to do? Is he going to moon me? [Laughs] Oh, run, Hyde, run.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t forget the beers.
 <br>
 ! The beers.
 <br>
 [GasPing] [WhimPering] [Gasps] [Murmuring, Indistinct] [Water Running] Why are you in my bathroom? Get out! Out! Out! I need the shower.
 <br>
 - I got pooped on.
 <br>
 - All right, stop it.
 <br>
 Cut it out.
 <br>
 - [Water Flushes] - [Screaming] That&#39;s really hot.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You spilled my shampoo, you idiot! [Gasps] Help.
 <br>
 [Sobbing] You can&#39;t kill me like you killed Midge, you big doofy.
 <br>
 Midge? I didn&#39;t kill Midge.
 <br>
 She&#39;s in Chicago visiting her sister.
 <br>
 Oh, really? Then what was in the heavy garbage sacks? Garbage, you idiot.
 <br>
 Oh, well, I guess that explains the giant knife guts all over your apron.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 No, it doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Explain that, killer.
 <br>
 - They were pumpkin guts.
 <br>
 I was making jack-o&#39;-lanterns.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re hiding Midge&#39;s body in a jack-o&#39;-lantern.
 <br>
 Clever plan.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Look, there&#39;s Midge now.
 <br>
 Not dead or nothing.
 <br>
 Oh, goody.
 <br>
 You can go now.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Midgie, no! Cover yourself! - [Door Closes] - Ow.
 <br>
 Give it.
 <br>
 Give it! Ay! [Whimpers] Donna! Donna! Why would she go up the water tower? Why does she want to be up there? And why am I talking to myself? I have to- [Gasps] Climb.
 <br>
 [Breathing Heavily] [Gasps] [Screaming] [Panting] Donna, what the hell are you doing? Well, I guess you&#39;ve caught me.
 <br>
 And if you must know the truth I&#39;m not boring, you ass.
 <br>
 I never said you were boring.
 <br>
 - How&#39;d you know I&#39;d follow you here? - I saw you spying on me.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t- No, I wasn&#39;t spying on you.
 <br>
 I was teaching Fez how to spy on your naked- Yeah, you know what, I was spying on you.
 <br>
 - What a weird night.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 Please, Donna, tell me there&#39;s not a head in that basket.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a picnic.
 <br>
 So- So, we&#39;re okay? Ow, you&#39;re on my wig.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! I&#39;m gonna die! - Eric, hold on.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna pull you up.
 <br>
 - No, Donna, you can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just a girl.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, you- Hey.
 <br>
 Okay, you got it.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] That&#39;s- To be honest, it was never really a problem.
 <br>
 - Whoa.
 <br>
 - [Screaming] [Groans] Ow.
 <br>
 [Gasps] [Cawing] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Screaming Continues] - [Gasping] - [Cawing] Oh, my goodness.
 <br>
 A phone booth.
 <br>
 That&#39;s lucky.
 <br>
 [Cawing Continues] [Screaming] - [Screaming Continues] - [Cawing] [Gasping] [Laughing] Oh, thank God.
 <br>
 It was just a dream.
 <br>
 [Breathing Heavily] Well, I can&#39;t go back there.
 <br>
 I just can&#39;t.
 <br>
 [Sighs] So, you know, Donna, even though my ankle&#39;s sprained I can still probably make it up that water tower.
 <br>
 You know, finish what we started.
 <br>
 I would, but I don&#39;t know if I can.
 <br>
 I mean, something happened to me up there too.
 <br>
 Oh, I know.
 <br>
 Vertigo, right? Fear of heights? No, Eric.
 <br>
 Fear of sex.
 <br>
 [Gasps] [Screaming]
