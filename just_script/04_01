 <br>
 - Hyde, what are you doing? Get the hell off her! - Eric, they can&#39;t hear you.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you watch movies? I mean, this is pretty basic stuff here.
 <br>
 Well, Eric, it&#39;s three months later.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s with Hyde, Kelso&#39;s with Jackie, and you became-Just watch.

 <br>
 This is made-up angel crap.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t cave to Red like that.
 <br>
 Ah, you&#39;ve already forgotten what a wuss you were.
 <br>
 See, it was Donna who gave you the confidence to stand up to Red.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m gonna show you a lot of neat stuff like this.
 <br>
 Well, I guess I have no choice.
 <br>
 Like everyone doesn&#39;t try that.

 <br>
 Then you won&#39;t have to drop out.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) - ( Angel Chuckles ) - Okay, Mom.
 <br>
 Now get one of me giving her the corsage.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s roll, Twiggy.
 <br>
 My bra&#39;s about to snap.
 <br>
 I went to prom with Big Rhonda? Sweet, huh? Real quick, real quick.
 <br>
 Now, Rhoda- It&#39;s Rhonda! Rhon-da! God! Rhon-da.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry, dear.

 ( Chuckles ) I told you he&#39;d fall for the first piece of tail that came along.
 <br>
 Shh! Okay- Okay.

 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Classy! ( Stereo: Slow Rock ) What? What&#39;s Fez doing? - Step away from that stereo! - But, Hyde, I got the new Leo Sayer album.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody! I just made Forman a man.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Well, as much of a man as he&#39;ll ever be.
 <br>
 Kelso and Pam Macy? - But Kelso and Jackie got back together on prom night.
 <br>
 - Never happened.
 <br>
 I wrote you a love poem, Pam.
 <br>
 It goes like this: I love your rack.
 <br>
 I&#39;d love to shack up with you and do it too.
 <br>
 Oh, Michael.
 <br>
 That is so deep.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I kicked that poem&#39;s ass! - ( Laughing ) It&#39;s all a domino effect, Eric.
 <br>
 You see, Hyde wasn&#39;t there to takeJackie to prom, so she couldn&#39;t make up with Kelso.
 <br>
 See? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s so sad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like my relationship with Donna touched everyone&#39;s life.
 <br>
 And I was just gonna throw that a- ( Blows Raspberry ) Okay, you&#39;re unpleasant.
 <br>
 Just give it up.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 None of this is really that bad anyway.
 <br>
 Well, it gets a lot worse.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going into the future.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right: the &#39;80s.
 <br>
 - ( Man Singing New Wave Rock ) - ( Ends ) - Hey, what the hell was that? Oh, you&#39;ll find out.
 <br>
 Welcome to 1 983- Donna and Hyde&#39;s wedding.
 <br>
 ( Eric ) Man, did you have to make her pregnant? Good God, I wish I could just wake up.
 <br>
 Oh-Oh, you may never wake up.
 <br>
 This could be a coma dream.
 <br>
 Congratulations, Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Steven Hyde from Cedar Rapids&#39;s number one anchorman.
 <br>
 Kelso, man, glad you could make it.
 <br>
 - Hey, oh, man, can I kiss the bride? - Sure.
 <br>
 Damn it, Kelso! You don&#39;t French the bride! Where&#39;s the food? - Please, honey, for the love of God- - Don&#39;t &#39;&#39;honey&#39;&#39; me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hungry, stick man.
 <br>
 ( Sniffing ) Hey, Forman, so when are you and Big Rhonda gonna tie the knot, huh? Oh, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m so busy at Price Mart, and, uh, she has her dog grooming and her cheating on me, so- Jackie Burkhart? Is that you? I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Do I know you? It&#39;s Michael.
 <br>
 Kelso? It rings a stupid, little bell.
 <br>
 You know, I bet if I wasn&#39;t so happy as a globe-trotting stewardess I might actually remember the tiny effect you had on me in high school.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m on TV now.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve always loved you.
 <br>
 - Ow! - Oh, oh,Jake, honey, honey.
 <br>
 Be nice to your big brother.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not strong like you.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Brother&#39;&#39;? What the hell? Your parents finally had the son they always wanted.
 <br>
 - Now, Son, what do we call Eric? - Dumb-ass! There&#39;s my boy! ( Red, Kitty Laughing ) Oh, what a wonderful wedding.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so nice when children get married and- and move far away from their parents.
 <br>
 Or they don&#39;t get married and stay at home with their mother who they just couldn&#39;t stand to be- ( Singsong Voice ) away from.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 ( Electronic Keyboard ) Hey, Kelso, man.
 <br>
 I just opened your wedding gift.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s primo.
 <br>
 What do you say we go break it in? -  ( Continues ) - All right! ( Chuckles ) - ( Slaps ) You&#39;re leaving? I hate you! Call me.
 <br>
 - Fez.
 <br>
 - Good night, Wisconsin! ( Coughing ) This is really- ( Coughing ) I&#39;ve really missed- ( Coughing ) We have breaking news.
 <br>
 I&#39;m toasted.
 <br>
 Man, they pay me gobs of money to talk like that.
 <br>
 Fez, do something with your hair, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s making me paranoid.
 <br>
 Guys, I have discovered a band that will change music forever.
 <br>
 - ( Electronic Keyboard ) -  ( Singing New Wave Rock ) ( Ends ) I love to cook, you know? - I&#39;m really good with sauces.
 <br>
 - ( Hands Clap ) Guys, sometimes when I do the news I don&#39;t wear any pants! ( Inhales Deeply ) Whoo! ( Snickers ) You know, there are some things about Earth I really miss! ( Laughing ) Okay, welcome to your All right! I finally grew a mustache! Actually, it&#39;s chocolate cake.
 <br>
 - What happened to Kelso? - Oh, he got fired.
 <br>
 Yeah, he thought the news would be funnier drunk.
 <br>
 Now he works for you, selling water beds.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) What a loser! - Wait, I sell water beds? - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Kelso, what are you doing here? You&#39;re supposed to lock up the store tonight.
 <br>
 It&#39;s our reunion, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll lock it up tomorrow, I promise.
 <br>
 - Hello, Michael.
 <br>
 - Hello,Jackie.
 <br>
 Oh, I just want to let you to know that, uh, I married Pam Macy.
 <br>
 She&#39;s one hell of a cook, a super lady, and I&#39;m really, really happy.
 <br>
 Good, &#39;cause I wouldn&#39;t be with you anyway.
 <br>
 You&#39;re fat.
 <br>
 Okay, Michael.
 <br>
 When you&#39;re done being a pig, I&#39;ll be in the Le Car.
 <br>
 - Uh, I&#39;m sorry, Rhonda.
 <br>
 - ( Mutters ) - Uh, yeah.
 <br>
 - Rhonda? Oh, my God, Rhonda! ( Laughs ) Hi, Eric.
 <br>
 Uh, I was hoping you&#39;d be here.
 <br>
 - I just wanted to thank you.
 <br>
 - Thank me? Yes.
 <br>
 Um, after you broke up with me, I was so disgusted with my life.
 <br>
 I mean, if someone like you didn&#39;t want to see me- ( Inhales Sharply ) Whoo! So, thanks to you and Jane Fonda, I have this new, fabulous body and a successful aerobics studio.
 <br>
 Well, hey, you know what? - I&#39;m glad I could help.

 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Good one.
 <br>
 ( Both Laugh ) - So, how are you doing? - Um, I was pretty lousy until I saw how fat Kelso got.
 <br>

 <br>
 - Oh, right.
 <br>
 - I heard you guys moved.
 <br>
 How&#39;s Hyde? - Hyde&#39;s good.
 <br>

 <br>
 ( Laughs ) ( Clears Throat ) You know, don&#39;t laugh, but- - Actually, never mind.
 <br>
 - No, no.
 <br>
 What? I had a crush on you in high school.
 <br>
 I had a crush on you too.
 <br>
 You know, I almost kissed you once.
 <br>
 - What might&#39;ve been, huh? - ( Sighs ) So- ( Clears Throat ) So are you- are you still writing? Oh, God.
 <br>
 Well, I mean, permission slips.
 <br>
 - Three kids, you know.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 Well, you should start again, &#39;cause, you know you were really good at it.

 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Huh? Huh? Start the waterworks.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 - Come on.
 <br>
 You gotta feel something.
 <br>
 Yeah- envy.
 <br>
 He never had to feel the pain of losing her.
 <br>
 Oh, wait a minute.
 <br>
 You actually had a relationship with Donna? - Wait, I thought you said he couldn&#39;t hear me.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m loose with the rules.
 <br>
 - So sue me.
 <br>
 - No, seriously.
 <br>
 You had Donna? Look- ( Sighs ) We broke up.
 <br>
 You&#39;re much better off.
 <br>
 Says you! Look at me! I&#39;m 28 years old.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve only had sex with Big Rhonda, and all three times, believe me she did not look like that! Idiot! You&#39;re sad you were never with Donna? Well, you got off light, man! I had her, and I lost her! And believe me, you don&#39;t want to know how bad that hurts! - ( Door Opens ) - ( Groans ) - So - ( Door Closes ) -you&#39;re an angel, right? - Why, yes.
 <br>
 Yes I am.
 <br>
 Can you, like- Can you do anything to help me? Listen closely: No.
 <br>
 You know, Angel, thanks.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ve got to go to sleep, &#39;cause I have a big day of misery ahead of me.
 <br>
 Okay, you win.
 <br>
 It was better never to have loved at all.
 <br>
 Thank you! And, hey, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll make you a deal.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna take it all away.
 <br>
 You won&#39;t feel a thing- good or bad.
 <br>
 Really? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, do it.
 <br>
 Okay.

 Well, let me just remind you what you&#39;re giving up.
