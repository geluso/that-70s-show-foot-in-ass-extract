<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 And then I realized, that&#39;s why they call it a clock radio.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause it&#39;s got both.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Feast your eyes.
 <br>
 All new stuff for me and Joanne&#39;s weekend away at tennis camp.
 <br>
 BillieJean King&#39;s sister is leading the campfire songs.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna make quite the racket.
 <br>
 Good one, Bob.
 <br>
 Bob&#39;s goin&#39; out of town for the weekend? All right! Party at Donna&#39;s! Okay.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna need beer, balloons and girls with low self-esteem.
 <br>
 Guys, hang on.
 <br>
 Donna and I already made plans this weekend.
 <br>
 Well, then just leave us a key, man.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 If anything bad happens I know how to make it look like a robbery-homicide.
 <br>
 Look, Eric and I want one weekend alone where we don&#39;t have to be so secret about being engaged.
 <br>
 I could even wear my ring if it weren&#39;t being resized for me.
 <br>
 Can they make a ring big enough to fit your Paul Bunyan hands? - Jackie? - Well, I&#39;m sorry, Donna but if you&#39;re not gonna have a party, you&#39;re gonna get insulted.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just the way it is.
 <br>
 The way I see it, unless Donna&#39;s blockin&#39; the door with her giant hands - we&#39;re comin&#39; over for a party.
 <br>
 - Oh-Oh! We should get one of those girls that jump out of cakes.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 They&#39;re great.
 <br>
 You know, you two could do a little less standin&#39; around and a little more jumpin&#39; out of cakes.
 <br>
 Morning.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad, I was thinking of spending tonight and tomorrow over at Fez&#39;s.
 <br>
 At whose&#39;s? The foreign boy with the tight pants wears a little too much cologne.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like him.
 <br>
 I caught him stealin&#39; bacon out of our fridge.
 <br>
 Why are you doing your homework in the morning? Uh, I was out last night with Donna.
 <br>
 Well, of course you were.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why you came in a half hour past the curfew.
 <br>
 Oh, well, Donna had a flat.
 <br>
 Ohh! That&#39;s awful bad luck.
 <br>
 Seein&#39; how Donna doesn&#39;t have a car.
 <br>
 I see you getting bigger but you still act like a 12-year-old.
 <br>
 Now, when are you gonna grow up and start thinkin&#39; about your future? Red, don&#39;t get upset so early.
 <br>
 You won&#39;t enjoy your sausage and Tang.
 <br>
 Sausage and Tang? Is- Is that a little racy for breakfast? I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m gonna leave before someone explains it.
 <br>
 Good morning.
 <br>
 Steven.
 <br>
 You got a big tear in that jacket.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hard hoppin&#39; over a fence carrying two 12 packs.
 <br>
 I mean, library books.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m gonna ignore that, &#39;cause you don&#39;t even have parents to buy you a new coat.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t have parents, Eric.
 <br>
 He told me that sometimes when he&#39;s all alone, he cries.
 <br>
 Oh, that settles it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m taking you shopping for a new coat.
 <br>
 Here, here.
 <br>
 Take some Tang and go.
 <br>
 Man, if I had a dollar for every time I heard a chick say that.
 <br>
 [Laughs] What? What? Never turn down Tang.
 <br>
 Growing boys need Tang.
 <br>
 What is funny here? ## [Rock Group S/ng/ng] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greet/ng] Oh, the plumber took apart the toilet upstairs, so you&#39;ll have to use this one.
 <br>
 - I know it&#39;s scary down here at night, but- - She&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Just when you come around that corner in the dark, that coat rack can look like a bear.
 <br>
 [Door Closes] Finally - we&#39;re alone.
 <br>
 - For the whole weekend.
 <br>
 All right! Party time! I brought the Slip &#39;n Slide.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s move the couch.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get the hose.
 <br>
 No, we don&#39;t need the hose, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll just use beer.
 <br>
 - Kelso, are you nuts? - You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t wanna waste the beer.
 <br>
 Go get the hose, man.
 <br>
 No! Guys, we said, no party.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Forman.
 <br>
 Look, man, you gotta help me out here.
 <br>
 Jackie and I are going through a really rough time and maybe, just maybe, we can start to heal if you can find it in your heart to let me trash your girlfriend&#39;s house! Don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s party time, man.
 <br>
 I invited a girl in a halter top who was on her fifth beer.
 <br>
 - Fifth beer! Halter top! - Forget it, Kelso.
 <br>
 But do you know what a Slip &#39;n Slide can do to a halter top? It turns it into a belt.
 <br>
 [Rhone R/ngs] - Hello? - Hello, is, uh, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman there? No, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 You just missed him.
 <br>
 Can I take a message? Yes.
 <br>
 This is, uh, Fenton from All That Glitters.
 <br>
 Um, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman bought a ring here, and I&#39;m calling to tell him it&#39;s ready.
 <br>
 And, ah, oh, it looks fabulous.
 <br>
 He bought me a ring? Oh, uh- [Clears Throat] I, uh- I hope it wasn&#39;t a surprise.
 <br>
 Perhaps you shouldn&#39;t know that I called.
 <br>
 Um- Uh, could you let Mr.
 <br>
 Forman know that I called.
 <br>
 I mean, um- You shouldn&#39;t know that he bought you- Oh! Now I&#39;ve made a messy.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, dinner is all ready.
 <br>
 I just had to add the secret ingredient- love.
 <br>
 - By the way, &#34;love&#34; is salt.
 <br>
 - [Chuckles] All right.
 <br>
 Chicken Pinciotti for two.
 <br>
 Um, is this red stuff gravy or blood? There&#39;s no gravy.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I guess it&#39;s just kinda moist then.
 <br>
 Actually, it&#39;s kinda pink.
 <br>
 Is this ham? No, it&#39;s Chicken Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Mine looks fine.
 <br>
 Well, if you don&#39;t wanna eat yours we have some Fruity Pebbles.
 <br>
 No- No.
 <br>
 Grown-ups don&#39;t eat Fruity Pebbles.
 <br>
 They eat chicken.
 <br>
 What grown-ups? Where are these grown-ups? Donna, us.
 <br>
 The whole point of this weekend is to prove that we&#39;re grown up and that Red doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about when he says I&#39;m immature.
 <br>
 It is? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I thought the point of this weekend was to have, you know, a fun, light weekend.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 No, it will be fun and light.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that in the next 36 hours I would like to prove to myself that my father&#39;s been wrong about me my entire life.
 <br>
 But in a fun, light way.
 <br>
 - Well, whatever.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to eat the chicken.
 <br>
 - No! What? No.
 <br>
 Are you kidding? I was kidding.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I&#39;m doing our grown up, domestic squabbling thing, you know? It&#39;s like, I make fun of your cooking, you tell me to put on pants when we have company.
 <br>
 Are you gonna stop wearing your pants? &#39;Cause I might have a problem with that.
 <br>
 See? Good, we&#39;re bickering like husband and wife.
 <br>
 What, you call this dinner? [Laughs] Hey, take my wife, please.
 <br>
 [Laughs] That&#39;s delicious.
 <br>
 Steven, just come in.
 <br>
 Your jacket looks fine.
 <br>
 [Door Closes] Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I don&#39;t think this jacket&#39;s really my style.
 <br>
 Oh, nonsense.
 <br>
 Ever since I&#39;ve know you, you&#39;ve been nothing but flash and pizzazz.
 <br>
 [Giggles] Oh, and look, it says &#34;stuntman&#34; on the arm.
 <br>
 People are gonna think you&#39;re from Hollywood.
 <br>
 - Excuse me.
 <br>
 - Yes? Oh.
 <br>
 Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 I was wondering if I might look at that ring you called Mr.
 <br>
 Forman about that he doesn&#39;t know I know about yet.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I&#39;m supposed to show you, but- but I do a lot of things behind this counter I&#39;m not supposed to do.
 <br>
 So, hmm.
 <br>
 This is an engagement ring.
 <br>
 An engagement ring? Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Why would Red give me a diamond ring? Maybe it&#39;s a menopause diamond.
 <br>
 You know, for a happy menopause.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, it&#39;s engraved.
 <br>
 &#34;To Donna.
 <br>
 &#34; You&#39;re a lucky woman, Donna.
 <br>
 I mean, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman seems a tad young for you but, uh, men and women are doing all sorts of things we never used to do, hmm? Oh, my goodness! This is from Eric to- Eric and Donna are engaged? Well, if they are, I&#39;m learning it here for the first time.
 <br>
 So, Mr.
 <br>
 Stuntman.
 <br>
 Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 Are you from Hollywood? I gotta tell ya, this &#34;being grown up&#34; thing really seems to work for us.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we&#39;re already good at being married.
 <br>
 All we did was eat.
 <br>
 Hey, a little secret they don&#39;t tell ya? That&#39;s all marriage is.
 <br>
 [Knock/ng] Forman, listen.
 <br>
 I just got back from the mall with your mom.
 <br>
 Nice coat, Hyde.
 <br>
 Burt Reynolds have a garage sale? [Laughs] Yeah, Hyde, Donna and I are trying to be alone.
 <br>
 We got no use for a shiny, red stuntman.
 <br>
 - Look, would you shut up and listen to me- - No! Okay? This house is closed to parties, okay? So just go away.
 <br>
 Oh, and tell the cast of Smokey and the Band/t that I said, &#34;10-4.
 <br>
 &#34; Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gone, man.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you mean, &#34;I&#39;m eastbound and down, good buddy&#34;? [Laughs] What does a married couple do after a delicious dinner of Chicken Pinciotti? Well, we could make out on the couch but we&#39;re married, so maybe we should just fight and go to bed.
 <br>
 - Whoa.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s wrong? Whoa! Okay, I think the Chicken Pinciotti wants to - fly the coop.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be upstairs for a little bit.
 <br>
 Uh, do you have any magazines that I could-Whoa! Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m- l-l-I&#39;ll just read the shampoo.
 <br>
 Well, wait.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t- You can&#39;t use the bathroom upstairs.
 <br>
 You have to use the one off the den.
 <br>
 Th- Right in there? Wh-While-While you&#39;re right in here? L-l-I can&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 You might sense something.
 <br>
 I &#34;might sense something&#34;? How much of a ruckus are you gonna make? Wh- I just- I can&#39;t go here, okay? And I can&#39;t go home because Red thinks I&#39;m over at Fez&#39;s.
 <br>
 What- I&#39;m a man without a country.
 <br>
 Eric, you wanted to be grown up.
 <br>
 And- Well, this is something that grown-ups do in the same house.
 <br>
 No, I ju-You know what I was thinking? I could build us another house, a separate house.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re talking about an outhouse.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s about time those made a comeback! Eric and Donna can&#39;t be engaged.
 <br>
 They&#39;re too young.
 <br>
 How does something like this happen? Well, Eric asked her to marry him and instead of saying &#34;ew,&#34; like a normal person Donna said &#34;yes.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, I don&#39;t like secret-keeping in my house.
 <br>
 What else is going on that I don&#39;t know about? Ooh.
 <br>
 There is something else.
 <br>
 In the back left corner of Forman&#39;s closet he has stashed some highly offensive photographic material.
 <br>
 Well, this has gotta stop.
 <br>
 Eric should have told me about his engagement, because in this house we do not keep secrets.
 <br>
 What are you talkin&#39; about? Cheesecake.
 <br>
 Different types of cheesecake.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Sorry I missed it.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t judge me.
 <br>
 Kelso, I need to use your bathroom.
 <br>
 Nope.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nobody here.
 <br>
 Of course, I can&#39;t see people who don&#39;t have parties for their friends.
 <br>
 So maybe there is somebody here, and I just can&#39;t see &#39;em.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t see you, Eric! Kelso, I really need to use the bathroom.
 <br>
 Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you kicked us out of Donna&#39;s house, you party pooper.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - No party, no pooper! - Nice.
 <br>
 - Yeah, it really was.
 <br>
 No party, no pooper! So then I said, &#34;No party, no pooper!&#34; Because he wouldn&#39;t have a party.
 <br>
 See, I think it&#39;s stupid that Eric and Donna need to practice being married.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s simple.
 <br>
 The woman just needs to be a cook in the kitchen a maid in the living room, and an acrobat in the bedroom.
 <br>
 And I can hire a cook and a maid.
 <br>
 I am liking you more and more.
 <br>
 You know, I was thinkin&#39; about The Incred/ble Hulk.
 <br>
 I like that show.
 <br>
 Especially the part where he gets all, like, mad and turns green and then his shirt rips off.
 <br>
 But then I was thinkin&#39;, like what if he was purple? And a lady? Come on.
 <br>
 Like an angry, naked purple chick.
 <br>
 That&#39;s better, right? [Red] What&#39;s go/n&#39;on down here? Why doesn&#39;t anybody ever go home? And then I realized, that&#39;s why they call it a clock radio.
 <br>
 [All] Cause it&#39;s got both! What are you doin&#39; here? I thought Eric was with you.
 <br>
 Eric is always with me in spirit.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t pussyfoot around.
 <br>
 I make three phone calls, you&#39;re back on that raft you floated in on.
 <br>
 - Eric is at Donna&#39;s.
 <br>
 - Fez! I fear the open sea.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 You know what I just found out about Eric? You found out? He lied to us.
 <br>
 He&#39;s spending the night at Donna&#39;s.
 <br>
 Oh! What did you think it was? He has dirty magazines in his closet.
 <br>
 Our son is a pervert.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just gonna go pray for him.
 <br>
 Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Well, speak of the idiot.
 <br>
 - I gotta use the bathroom.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s a matter with the foreign kid&#39;s bathroom? That is where you were, isn&#39;t it? Yeah, of course.
 <br>
 Wh-Why would I lie to you about something like that? I need bacon.
 <br>
 Okay, uh, the reason I&#39;d lie about something like that is- What happened? You piss Donna off, and she locked you out? - Donna? No.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Well, you pissed me off, so I&#39;m lockin&#39; you out.
 <br>
 - Did you find- - Don&#39;t stop loving me! Well, look who&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Oh, say, Eric.
 <br>
 The morning paper didn&#39;t come.
 <br>
 So I thought that you could tell me a story while I eat.
 <br>
 I know how good you are at making up stories.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you tell me things? You can tell me things, even bad things.
 <br>
 A mother&#39;s love is like a flower that never wilts.
 <br>
 Unless it&#39;s lied to.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re done reciting poetry, I&#39;d like to yell at the kid.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman, this is about to get ugly.
 <br>
 So if you have to go potty, now&#39;s a good time.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Okay, I shouldn&#39;t have told you I was at Fez&#39;s.
 <br>
 [Exhales] Do you ever think about what you&#39;re doing with your life? Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my life, okay? I&#39;m grown up now.
 <br>
 Grown up? Well, you sure say that a lot, so it must be true.
 <br>
 Let me try it.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Mr.
 <br>
 Rogers.
 <br>
 But wait, I&#39;m not wearing a sweater.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m about to kick your ass.
 <br>
 Maybe it doesn&#39;t work.
 <br>
 Maybe you&#39;re just an immature pissant who still lies to his parents.
 <br>
 You know what, Dad? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Y- I have been lying and acting immature, and keeping secrets.
 <br>
 And I swear to God, I&#39;m just as sick of it as you are.
 <br>
 So, here&#39;s the truth.
 <br>
 Donna and I are engaged.
 <br>
 I get his room.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re engaged? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - I already gave her the ring.
 <br>
 - Kitty, are you hearing this? Yes, I am.
 <br>
 And for the first time too.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s true.
 <br>
 So, if I&#39;m gonna be ready to be married, which I am then I guess I should be ready to tell you the truth.
 <br>
 So, there it is.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 That felt great.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I&#39;m gonna go see my fiancÃ©.
 <br>
 Wow, that felt great too.
 <br>
 What a great day! Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, this is good.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all being open here.
 <br>
 Does anybody have anything else they wanna get off their chest? Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I hate my jacket.
 <br>
 Oh, well, now we&#39;re just trying to hurt each other.
 <br>
 Okay, now.
 <br>
 Come on, Steven.
 <br>
 Give it another chance.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s snazzy! Hey, there.
 <br>
 Hi, there.
 <br>
 Check out my outerwear.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just give this to Goodwill.
 <br>
 And read the arm- &#34;stuntman.
 <br>
 &#34; People are gonna think I&#39;m from Hollywood.
 <br>
 [Mouths Word]
