<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 All right, Donna put your chair here.
 <br>
 I wanna get Steven&#39;s attention, and with you next to me I&#39;ll look like a tiny porcelain doll.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know Jackie, some people actually find me to be of normal height.
 <br>
 Sure if they&#39;re green and jolly.
 <br>
 - I can&#39;t take it.
 <br>
 Watching Donna lie out, knowing she&#39;s gonna go to college and I have to stay here, She&#39;s so, so Juicy.
 <br>
 My Juicy.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m not gonna stay here locked in the house just cause Jackie looks ridiculously hot in that bathing suit.
 <br>
 Later Forman.
 <br>
 - Bye bye juicy.
 <br>
 Ladies.
 <br>
 Ladies bodies.
 <br>
 I wish someone would rub lotion on my shoulders.
 <br>
 Think they&#39;re getting a little red.
 <br>
 Yeah, you should be careful.
 <br>
 Looks like you&#39;re starting to scab.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s a burn about a burn.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a second degree burn! Y&#39;know Jackie, I think maybe Hyde&#39;s moved on.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t just move on from Jackie Burkhardt.
 <br>
 I&#39;m like the bottle, you need a twelve step program to break my spell.
 <br>
 Okay ladies.
 <br>
 All these sound waves are interfering with my sunrays.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s tan.
 <br>
 Alright, I&#39;m gonna need you to lotion me up, darling, but only rub where you can see.
 <br>
 No roaming! THAT &#39;70s SHOW Join Together Hey, Mom, Dad, I have something I wanna tell you.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve decided not to move away.
 <br>
 - What? I&#39;m gonna stay and put off college for just a little while or at least until you&#39;re well enough to go back to work.
 <br>
 - My baby, my baby, my baby.
 <br>
 Mom okay, this is actually kind of embarrassing.
 <br>
 You&#39;re actually really hurting me, yeah.
 <br>
 You mean I&#39;ve been waiting eighteen years for you to get your butt out of this house, and now you&#39;re staying? I signed over my pay check to you.
 <br>
 I want you to go buy yourself something pretty.
 <br>
 Or I don&#39;t know electricity.
 <br>
 Oh honey, thank you.
 <br>
 Red it wouldn&#39;t kill you to thank him.
 <br>
 - It might I just had a heart attack.
 <br>
 Speaking of which, I just found this in the garbage.
 <br>
 Why would you throw away the list of all the food the doctor said we couldn&#39;t have in the house? Kitty did you look at that list? If I had known what I was coming home to after my heart attack, I would&#39;ve walked straight into that bright light and never looked back.
 <br>
 Oh come on, it can&#39;t be that bad.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll do it with you.
 <br>
 Cause what&#39;s good for the goose, is good for the gander.
 <br>
 Actually, Mom, Dad&#39;s the gander.
 <br>
 The male goose.
 <br>
 So it would be what&#39;s good for the gander is good for the goose.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s take a gander at what you&#39;re giving up with the gander.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how you do that.
 <br>
 Potato chips, other salty snacks.
 <br>
 Good advice, that doctor obviously knows what he&#39;s talking about.
 <br>
 Butter, heavy cream, cheese.
 <br>
 - Gone, makes a lot of sense.
 <br>
 Alcoholic beverages.
 <br>
 - Okay, that doctor&#39;s a quack.
 <br>
 God, it&#39;s gonna be so hard going off to college without you.
 <br>
 But we&#39;ll see each other on the weekends right? Well you say that now, but then there&#39;s that weekend when you call home and say you have to study but I here Moose, the place kicker in the background, asking if you want another shot of tequila.
 <br>
 Eric, that would never happen.
 <br>
 I would never date a place kicker, it&#39;s Quarterback or nothing for me.
 <br>
 The more I think about leaving you, the sadder I get.
 <br>
 And the sadder I get, the more I wanna be with you.
 <br>
 Right now.
 <br>
 - Now? Well yeah, I Whoa, alright this is great, it&#39;ll be like completely spontaneous, like I just Why are you talking? - I&#39;m sorry, I So it turns out that going away sex is even hotter than make up sex.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like these chips, they say now even crunchier, and you&#39;re thinking, oh man there is no way, but then you take a bite and it is crunchier.
 <br>
 Dude if something&#39;s crunchy, you should really have that looked at.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no time my friend, I have a distraught neighbour girl to attend to.
 <br>
 Dry your eyes baby, the lovin&#39;s on its way! Toe ring.
 <br>
 - Oh, Fez you like? Yeah, got a toe ring.
 <br>
 - On the little piggy that went to the market.
 <br>
 Steven what do you think? - Can&#39;t resist toe ring.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 I have all sorts of things now that I didn&#39;t have when we were going out.
 <br>
 Toe ring, tan lines, a tattoo.
 <br>
 - You don&#39;t have a tattoo, you&#39;re bluffing.
 <br>
 Do you have a tattoo? Well we&#39;re not going out, so I guess you&#39;ll never know.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna stop wearing them all together.
 <br>
 See ya.
 <br>
 Look at you watching her, you love her, man.
 <br>
 &#34;Oh, baby, I love you so much.
 <br>
 &#34; Were you doing Jackie? - Yes, yes.
 <br>
 Why am I even thinking about her? Man, she&#39;s like Tahiti.
 <br>
 It&#39;s warm and it&#39;s beautiful and you wanna go there, but when you do you get bit by a mosquito and you get malaria and you&#39;re sick for the rest of your life.
 <br>
 She&#39;s obviously not over you either.
 <br>
 She&#39;s practically putting on a show to get your attention.
 <br>
 Just imagine it.
 <br>
 I love to dance.
 <br>
 Okay the doctor wins.
 <br>
 Eric and I boxed up all the liquor.
 <br>
 Man, look at all this, it&#39;s like Dean Martin exploded.
 <br>
 There were bottles in the liquor cabinet, the dining room hutch, my Mom&#39;s nightstand.
 <br>
 Oh no, no, that&#39;s for polishing furniture.
 <br>
 - Mom, there&#39;s lipstick on it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just your luck Forman.
 <br>
 You&#39;re about to turn eighteen and there&#39;s gonna be no hooch left in the house to steal.
 <br>
 I mean avoid.
 <br>
 Do homework next to.
 <br>
 Pray near.
 <br>
 Come on! Yeah, it&#39;s gonna be pretty boring around here.
 <br>
 You know what you should do?  Go to college.
 <br>
 Mom would it be too much to ask for Dad to be grateful that I&#39;m staying? Honey, we&#39;re all going through hard times.
 <br>
 You&#39;re giving up your future, I&#39;m giving up my Schnapps.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not compare our pain.
 <br>
 Hey, sorry I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 Donna was really upset about leaving, so I had to comfort her in a bedular way.
 <br>
 It turns out if I get her sad, she gives it away like goldfish at a freakin&#39; carnival.
 <br>
 Eric, I think you may have found a secret open sesame to sex.
 <br>
 Make the lady cry.
 <br>
 Perhaps I should try that with my wife.
 <br>
 &#34;Laurie here&#39;s a dead cat, now do me.
 <br>
 &#34; A little history Fez, I think Laurie has a lot of open sesames.
 <br>
 Like, &#34;Hi, Laurie&#34;.
 <br>
 That usually does it.
 <br>
 Actually I only ever got as far as &#39;Hi&#39;.
 <br>
 Fez, I did it with your wife! God I have so much power over Donna now, it&#39;s like I know how Obi-Wan Kenobi feels.
 <br>
 &#34;These aren&#39;t the droids you&#39;re looking for.
 <br>
 &#34; Man, I wish I could do it with Donna in a land speeder on.
 <br>
 That would be so awesome.
 <br>
 Hey, Steven, check out my new super sexy tattoo.
 <br>
 Hard to keep your hands off, huh? Steven! Sorry, here&#39;s your tattoo back.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take that.
 <br>
 - Steven, why are you being so difficult? Jackie, no amount of tattoos or toe rings, are gonna fix the fact that you have a lot to apologise for.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the one who should apologise.
 <br>
 - Then I guess we&#39;re not getting back together.
 <br>
 I  guess we&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Oh, and by the way, you don&#39;t deserve a real tattoo.
 <br>
 But if I were to get one, I&#39;d show it to Fez before I&#39;d ever show it to you.
 <br>
 I hope she gets it on her hienie.
 <br>
 Jackie, it really bugs me that you and Hyde aren&#39;t back together, so as the man who used to pleasure you endlessly, I feel it is my obligation to step in and fix this, cause when I&#39;m a cop I&#39;m gonna have to deal with domestic cases like this all the time.
 <br>
 And the good news is, he&#39;ll have guns.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is gonna be a piece of cake.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know they should have put me in charge of Vietnam, I would have had those people making out in a week.
 <br>
 Wow, Donna, that might be the last time you&#39;ll ever get to see Kelso make an even bigger mess of a problem.
 <br>
 Yeah I&#39;m gonna miss that.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna miss you.
 <br>
 - Well I&#39;m not gonna miss you two slobbering all over each other like fat girls in a house with free meat.
 <br>
 And that might be the last time that Jackie ever makes fun of us, fat girls, and meat.
 <br>
 Yeah What? - Nothing, it just could be the last time that you and I stand beside the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 I just waxed her she&#39;s all slippy slidy.
 <br>
 Donna this might be the last time I bring you your toothbrush.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not my toothbrush.
 <br>
 Might be the last time I bring you the wrong toothbrush.
 <br>
 Hello, darling.
 <br>
 I see you are washing your unmentionables.
 <br>
 Yeah, do you know what gets out grass stains and Kailua? Anyways I was thinking how sad you must be considering the mess you made of your life.
 <br>
 With all that sadness, do you not also get needy? Y&#39;know, I sorta do.
 <br>
 - Ali Baba, the treasure is mine! I&#39;m gonna go see if Carlos is home.
 <br>
 That Carlos is one lucky SOB to have a wife like mine.
 <br>
 Look, Hyde, I know you don&#39;t wanna tell Jackie that you&#39;re sorry, but there&#39;s gotta some things that you did, that you wish you hadn&#39;t done.
 <br>
 Like that time that you told me to eat that stuff, and I didn&#39;t know what it was, and then you licked your lips, and you rubbed you stomach and you were like &#39;Mmm it&#39;s really good Kelso&#39; and then I ate it and then I wished I hadn&#39;t of done that.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, maybe with Jackie I was sort of impetuous and maybe a little rash.
 <br>
 Now see, that&#39;s something that Jackie oughta know.
 <br>
 Hyde say&#39;s that he was sort of infectious and he has a rash.
 <br>
 What? - I&#39;m just telling you what he said.
 <br>
 All right, look, Michael, Steven&#39;s the one who messed up the relationship.
 <br>
 He thought you and I were together but he was just wrong.
 <br>
 He fabricated the whole mess.
 <br>
 - Well somebody ought to make that clear.
 <br>
 Jackie wants you to know that there was a mess &#39;cause she was wearing the wrong fabric.
 <br>
 That can&#39;t be what she said.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s word for word, man.
 <br>
 Kelso, would you get outta here? - What, I&#39;m helping.
 <br>
 You&#39;re making me wanna kick your ass.
 <br>
 That better be the rash talking.
 <br>
 Busted, mister.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re like a damn cat.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna make you wear a bell.
 <br>
 Bad health in a can, that&#39;s what that is.
 <br>
 The doctor said he wants nothing like that around here, and I agree.
 <br>
 All it takes is a little bit of will power, Red.
 <br>
 Even though you used to do something without thinking, you just have to grab a hold of those thoughts.
 <br>
 Can I get you a refill there? Well there&#39;s a lesson for you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 Oh hey, listen, son.
 <br>
 It means a lot to your mother, you staying here and helping out the family.
 <br>
 And as for me I There.
 <br>
 Doctor said I should write down my feelings.
 <br>
 Are you actually thanking me? This is a list of yard work.
 <br>
 Yeah, the lawn thanks you for all that mowing you&#39;re gonna do.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome, Dad.
 <br>
 - Yeah, well.
 <br>
 All right, we&#39;re both men here.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s wrong? Nothing it&#39;s just this could be the last time that you and I watch Gilligan get hit on the head by the Skipper.
 <br>
 Eric, the more we talk about me going away, the sadder you get.
 <br>
 And being with you so much lately has been great, but afterwards well you always used to look a little bit ashamed and I mean now you just seem depressed.
 <br>
 Oh no, no, I&#39;m not depressed, Donna, you are depressed.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s do this.
 <br>
 All this last time stuff, have you been saying that just for sex? What?  Have I what? This is not the one you&#39;re angry with.
 <br>
 You&#39;re disgusting.
 <br>
 That might be the last time we fight over you trying to get me to have sex with you.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know Fez, this whole thing with Hyde and Jackie is stupid.
 <br>
 They both wanna be together, and they would in a second if they just thought that other one had said I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Eureka, Fez, Eureka! I&#39;m one step ahead of you my friend.
 <br>
 - Yeah I&#39;ll just lie to both of them, and tell them the other one said I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - I thought we were going to pan for gold.
 <br>
 Okay, here we go, let&#39;s make up.
 <br>
 All right, look, Steven, I heard what you said.
 <br>
 Yeah, I heard what wait a minute, you heard what I said? Yeah, Michael told me, and just so you know I&#39;m sorry too.
 <br>
 Too? No, you&#39;re not sorry too, you&#39;re sorry one, I&#39;m sorry too.
 <br>
 Wait, what, no Michael said that - Yeah, he said that I did my work, you two gotta clean this mess up yourselves.
 <br>
 So nothing&#39;s changed then? - Guess no.
 <br>
 Forget this.
 <br>
 - Okay, enough.
 <br>
 Look, you guys, who cares who apologised first? Jackie obviously wants to be with you, and you&#39;re here which means that you wanna be with her and I don&#39;t blame you, cause with that rash you ain&#39;t got a whole lotta choices.
 <br>
 All right, look, Steven, do you wanna be with me? No, no a shrug&#39;s not gonna cut it.
 <br>
 Steven, I need you to say something.
 <br>
 All right, look, I&#39;ll even go first.
 <br>
 Steven I wanna be with you.
 <br>
 And you I Can you hang on a second? Would you get outta here? If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say please.
 <br>
 - Fine, please.
 <br>
 That&#39;s better.
 <br>
 Jackie, I do wanna be with you.
 <br>
 Because you love - Don&#39;t push it.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven, where&#39;s your beer? - What? Me, beer? Kitty threw away all my beer, the Packers are down by 11, you&#39;re 18, I know you have beer, so where&#39;s your beer? I don&#39;t want used beer.
 <br>
 Well, I might have a couple of fresh ones in the shower.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m running low, I should probably hit the store.
 <br>
 <br>
