 - Where&#39;s the tunes, Forman? - Hang on, you guys.
 <br>
 Just one more wire here.
 <br>
 I learned how to speak English faster than this.
 <br>
 Fez, it&#39;s not real English when you speak it with a foreign accent.
 <br>
 Geez.
 <br>
 [Radio: Loud Rock] Aren&#39;t these the coolest? I can&#39;t hear you.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 They&#39;re the greatest speakers ever.

 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t see you there.
 <br>
 Well, I guess that&#39;s &#39;cause you were too busy making an ass of yourself.
 <br>
 Uh, actually I was trying out my new speakers.
 <br>
 What do you think? New speakers? What was wrong with the old ones? Those were genuine G.
 <br>

 <br>
 Well, just keep your monkey music turned down.

 <br>
 ! Boy, quite a day at Price Mart, Kitty.
 <br>
 First, the price of lightbulbs dropped two cents then Eric was made employee of the month and to top it off, they added Cheez-Its to the vending machine.
 <br>
 Are you serious? Yep.
 <br>
 Tiny little squares with the cheese flavor baked right in &#39;em.
 <br>
 Am I really the Mart employee of the month? - You sure are.
 <br>
 - Yea! And they even decided to throw in a extra 25 cents an hour.
 <br>
 Oh, yes.
 <br>
 I gotta admit, Eric.
 <br>
 I had my doubts, but, uh- Hell, you&#39;ve hardly embarrassed me.
 <br>
 Thanks, Dad.
 <br>
 Oh, this is great.
 <br>
 Whoo.
 <br>
 Price Mart rocks.
 <br>
 Oh, Laurie, tell everyone your good news.
 <br>
 I just finished my first two weeks of cosmetology school.
 <br>
 And she didn&#39;t flunk out.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that great? That is great, honey.
 <br>
 Nice job.
 <br>
 Thanks, Daddy.
 <br>
 Yeah, but the next exam&#39;s gonna kill me.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not allowed to practice on dummies anymore.
 <br>
 And I have to style a real person&#39;s hair.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, you&#39;ll do fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all here to support you.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 So, you don&#39;t mind being my model? Me? Oh, honey, no, no.
 <br>
 L- I go to the beauty parlor.
 <br>
 Okay, well- Well, maybe Eric can helP out.
 <br>
 Oh, sure.
 <br>
 Laurie, first of all, always run with scissors.
 <br>
 Boy, I never get tired of your sarcasm.
 <br>
 - Really? - [Clears Throat] Sorry.
 <br>
 Red, would you like to be a hair model? Kitty, I would like to have hair, period.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t, so no.
 <br>
 Oh, forget it.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even know why I picked this stupid career.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re stupid? Laurie, no.
 <br>
 You quit everything.
 <br>
 You are not quitting cosmetology school.
 <br>
 Well, what am I supposed to do? I will be your model.
 <br>
 But you just remember: Men have their cars.
 <br>
 Women have their hair.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like a car.
 <br>
 It&#39;s valuable.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] So, not only are they gonna hang my picture in the front of the store but I also get to represent our entire district in the national Price Mart Olympics.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Do you think I would choke to death if I swallowed my straw? No, it&#39;s got a breathing hole.
 <br>
 - Fez, no! - Fez, no! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 There she is.
 <br>
 - [Kelso] Who&#39;s that? - [Fez] The new girl, Caroline.
 <br>
 She transferred here from Sacred Heart.
 <br>
 Or heaven.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not sure which.
 <br>
 We have gym together.
 <br>
 She barely sweats.
 <br>
 Someday, I will make her my bride.
 <br>
 Yep, no one likes a sweaty bride.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I hear you.
 <br>
 - So true.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you go talk to her, man? - [Mutters] [Mouths Words] You&#39;re the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Your cocoa-brown skin makes me hot.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I am irresistible.
 <br>
 Would you like to dance? Hey.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you go talk to her, man? Oh, I don&#39;t know, Hyde.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t understand this.
 <br>
 Usually I am- I am suave.
 <br>
 I am silky.
 <br>
 But this girl makes me- I have to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 Anyway, getting back to Price Mart- - [Both] Shut up! - Yeah.

 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I just won two tickets to the Led Zeppelin concert.
 <br>
 I was caller number seven, and I won, and we&#39;re goin&#39; to Zeppelin on Tuesday night.
 <br>
 [Chortling] All right! She said two tickets, not four, ya moron.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not goin&#39;.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, no.
 <br>
 Did you say Tuesday night? L- I can&#39;t go Tuesday night.
 <br>
 It&#39;s inventory night.
 <br>
 It&#39;s mandatory.
 <br>
 Skip it, Eric.
 <br>
 You love Zeppelin.
 <br>
 Call in sick.
 <br>
 Tell them your grandma died.
 <br>
 Burn down the store.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 - [Snaps Fingers] [Sighs] I can&#39;t go.
 <br>
 - Then who am I gonna take? - No, Donna- - You shut your filthy mouth! - Donna, seriously- - I&#39;m practically his brother.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve been his friend way longer! Hey, you know what? I am going.
 <br>
 Ah, crap.
 <br>
 - Still friends? - Till death.
 <br>
 [Sighs] I can&#39;t go.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m in! Shut up! - Get killed! Uh- Eric, are you sure you can&#39;t come? Yeah, I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 You know.
 <br>
 Everyone has to work.
 <br>
 No exceptions.
 <br>
 Plus, Red and I? We&#39;re both kinda supervising.
 <br>
 - Mmm.
 <br>
 - Corporate America claims another victim.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I knew you weren&#39;t gonna go.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a really responsible guy.
 <br>
 [Clicks Tongue] I love and hate that about you.
 <br>
 Well, since, uh- Since Mr.
 <br>
 Smock here is being all logical I guess I&#39;ll have to take one of you losers.
 <br>
 - Take a loser where? - Zeppelin.
 <br>
 Zeppelin? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a band, right? Donna.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] In the ninth grade, I did an oral report on &#34;Stairway to Heaven,&#34; and I got a B-plus.
 <br>
 You gotta take me.
 <br>
 Donna, in the ninth grade, I wasn&#39;t a dork and I didn&#39;t write a report on &#34;Stairway to Heaven.
 <br>
 &#34; And you gotta take me.
 <br>
 God! She doesn&#39;t wanna take either one of you, &#39;cause she&#39;s taking me.
 <br>
 Donna, M-E, me! Okay, you know what? I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 [Sighs] I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 - You hate it, don&#39;t you? - No, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s interesting.
 <br>
 I mean, just- Just look at all this body.
 <br>
 I must- I bet I&#39;m- I&#39;m like- I&#39;m four inches taller.
 <br>
 I never should&#39;ve gotten into this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not good at anything.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 - I like it, Laurie.
 <br>
 - Really? Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 Now all you need is a cut.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Length- Length is good.
 <br>
 Length is good.
 <br>
 Drop &#39;em.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, did you see this? They gave me a Price Mart key chain.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got a knife and everything.
 <br>
 Yeah, I keep it in my pocket.
 <br>
 Some of the other guys get jealous.
 <br>
 Look, Eric, I know you&#39;re very excited about your raise and everything but I don&#39;t want you to get too caught up in this.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry, Dad.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not about to alienate my fellow employees with my award-winning work ethic.
 <br>
 I read the signs in the break room.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no &#34;l&#34; in teamwork.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your check, sir, and thank you for eating at Smiley&#39;s.
 <br>
 Ha, ha, ha.
 <br>
 Very funny.
 <br>
 You know what, Dad? I got this.
 <br>
 Take your hand off the check.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll come back.
 <br>
 Jackie, why do you wanna go anyway? You hate Led Zeppelin.
 <br>
 I never said I hated them, Michael.
 <br>
 For your information, I think Led is hot.
 <br>
 - Fez, is that her? - Yes.
 <br>
 I wish I could go talk to her, but I get so nervous.
 <br>
 Fez, you shouldn&#39;t be nervous.
 <br>
 You&#39;re awesome.
 <br>
 What girl wouldn&#39;t wanna be with you? Well, there is Jackie, Laurie this girl from gym, another girl from chemistry uh, country-western star Tanya Tucker who does not answer her letters.
 <br>
 - Um- - Okay, stop.
 <br>
 Whatever happened to suave, silky Fez? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I forgot about him.
 <br>
 He&#39;s hot.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 So- Go get her, Fez.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Caroline? It is Fez.
 <br>
 May I sit? Okay, thank you.
 <br>
 Great idea, Donna.
 <br>
 Well, excuse me for trying to buy a coworker lunch.
 <br>
 I am not your coworker.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a high school kid with a part-time job.
 <br>
 You&#39;re temporary.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 You know what ends fights? Pudding.
 <br>
 Just give me seven minutes.
 <br>
 Eric, you gotta stop acting like a big shot.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not the king of the world, you know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m employee of the month.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have to take this.
 <br>
 This is no good, Kitty.
 <br>
 - What are you gonna do, Red? He&#39;s growing up.
 <br>
 - No, I mean your hair.
 <br>
 Hey there, Harpo.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your horn? [Chortles] Bob, are you making fun of my hair? No.
 <br>
 - [All] Take me.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - [All] Take me.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re Donna, right? - Uh, yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m Caroline.
 <br>
 I think we have Spanish together.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Hola.
 <br>
 ! [Sighs] Um, you know that foreign guy you&#39;re always hanging out with? - Fez? - Mmm, yeah.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Um, is- Is he- Does he- Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You like Fez? - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll introduce you to him.
 <br>
 - Oh, no, no, no.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I just wanted to- I gotta go use the baño.
 <br>
 [ThumPing] StuPid, stuPid, stuPid.
 <br>
 ! What&#39;s goin&#39; on? Cosmetology is too hard.
 <br>
 I&#39;m quitting.
 <br>
 Laurie, don&#39;t you think I wanted to quit nursing school a hundred times? The first time I put in a catheter, it broke off.
 <br>
 But what if I don&#39;t get any better? Well, you will never know unless you stick with it.
 <br>
 - Oh, what do you care? - I care because I&#39;m your mother.
 <br>
 So, I care.
 <br>
 Well, we do start doing nails next week.
 <br>
 That might be fun.
 <br>
 And I happen to know a few patients down at the hospital who would love a manicure.
 <br>
 - Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 It&#39;s- It&#39;s- It&#39;s just gonna perk &#39;em right up when they come out of their comas.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 Good news.
 <br>
 Just got another raise.
 <br>
 Well, good for you, you dumb bastard.
 <br>
 Yeah, I tell ya.
 <br>
 If they keep throwin&#39; money at me like this I might be able to get my own apartment soon.
 <br>
 For God&#39;s sakes, you&#39;re 57 years old.
 <br>
 - Ah.
 <br>
 - Eric, why didn&#39;t you listen to me? If you&#39;d gone to college, you could&#39;ve really been something.
 <br>
 Been something? Whoa.
 <br>
 You&#39;re talkin&#39; to the interim assistant weekend manager of housewares here, okay? Yeah.
 <br>
 Show some respect.
 <br>
 Well aren&#39;t you just the president ofTurd Town? [Groans] Dad.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinkin&#39; about why you went so crazy and yelled at me and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that you&#39;re crazy and you like to yell at me.
 <br>
 There&#39;s somethin&#39; you gotta know.
 <br>
 You&#39;re-Well-You&#39;re an idiot.
 <br>
 Oh, great.
 <br>
 A pep talk.
 <br>
 Look, sit down.
 <br>
 When I was your age, I thought I had it all too.
 <br>
 Great job at the plant, nice steady paycheck- Just enough to, you know, string me along for 30 years or so.
 <br>
 And for what? So they could toss me out on my ass when things got tough.
 <br>
 - Dad, I&#39;m not gonna- - Look, don&#39;t get me wrong.
 <br>
 I admire your work ethic.
 <br>
 But you deserve better than Price Mart.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a smart guy.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m, uh- I&#39;m proud of you.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Really? - You-You think I&#39;m smart? You&#39;re proud of me? - Oh, geez.
 <br>
 What, you gonna ruin this now by talking? Listen, Dad.
 <br>
 If I&#39;m still workin&#39; at Price Mart when I&#39;m your- older please kill me.
 <br>
 - You don&#39;t have to ask twice, Son.
 <br>
 - Oh, that&#39;s- - That&#39;s my dad.
 <br>
 - Come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go make fun of your mom&#39;s hair.
 <br>
 - Jerk.
 <br>
 - Wench.
 <br>
 - Tool.
 <br>
 - Dill-hole.
 <br>
 - Moron.
 <br>
 - Moron.
 <br>
 I already said moron.
 <br>
 Moron.
 <br>
 [Stammering] Don&#39;t touch.
 <br>
 Those are for Donna.
 <br>
 - Kelso, Donna doesn&#39;t want a bunch of dirty cookies.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re not dirty.
 <br>
 They are now.
 <br>
 Hyde, you&#39;re dead.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Donna, where have you been? The concert starts in an hour.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ready to go.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 The concert? Oh, right.
 <br>
 The concert.
 <br>
 Well, you guys were so busy fighting over the tickets, I forgot to tell you.
 <br>
 I gave them away.
 <br>
 - What? - No! - To who? [Rock] [Slow Rock] See? Your cuticles look better already.
 <br>
 Proper nail care is one of the easiest things to overlook.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Real good.
 <br>
 Oh, gosh, Daddy.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know you were a bleeder.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 Um, could you apply some pressure to this while I go get some paper towels?
 <br>
