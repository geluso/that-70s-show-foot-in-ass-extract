<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 so, Eric, your dad&#39;s muffler shop opens tomorrow.
 <br>
 That&#39;s, like, the perfect job for him.
 <br>
 I mean, he&#39;s been muffling you for years.
 <br>
 Yes, he really hates noise.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s because it reminds him of fun.
 <br>
 Hey, at least Red got a job he likes.
 <br>
 I thought I was cool flipping burgers, then I met the night shift guy who&#39;s been doing it for 30 years.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got no eyebrows, and he lives in his own car.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to be that guy.
 <br>
 And you won&#39;t be if you follow the plan I gave you, Okay? We get a job as a local weather team, then go national as morning talk show hosts, and then star in our own ice capades.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;ve told you, I don&#39;t capade.
 <br>
 - I am quitting my job, though.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 The department of motor vehicles is not as glamorous as it sounds.
 <br>
 You know what motor vehicles are? They&#39;re cars.
 <br>
 Just cars.
 <br>
 Fez, you know what you should do? You should be a cop like me.
 <br>
 You could go undercover and catch foreigners.
 <br>
 Oh, so it&#39;s a crime to be foreign, huh? No, of course not.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a crime to do the things that foreigners do.
 <br>
 Well, I, for one, love my job.
 <br>
 Want to know why? I have no job.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s one of the benefits of taking the year off.
 <br>
 Speaking of that, how&#39;d that all-day marathon go on the slip &#39;n slide? Pretty good.
 <br>
 Except for around hour three, when I got a pretty serious owie.
 <br>
 Yeah, when you went in for a juice, I slipped a rock under there.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 Anyway, today, I will be chasing butterflies.
 <br>
 Tomorrow, I&#39;m gonna break out the giant bubble wand.
 <br>
 What&#39;d you do, go down the clearance aisle at the drugstore? Yes, I did.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll all be happy to know you&#39;ll be receiving goody bags containing 4th of july socks, cornstarch and a calendar from 1972.
 <br>
 Okay, I think we&#39;re nearly set up for business.
 <br>
 Thanks for helping, or, uh, standing around saying, &#34;ew, grease.
 <br>
 &#34; Whoa, Steven.
 <br>
 You already got that muffler together? Yeah, well, you know, metal shop was my favorite class.
 <br>
 I went to, like, half of &#39;em.
 <br>
 You know, I need an extra set of hands around here.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you like the job? No, Steven, you can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I mean, don&#39;t take this personally, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, but guys who work in muffler shops are bottom-feeders.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Well, I said, &#34;don&#39;t take this personally.
 <br>
 &#34; What else can I do? Jackie, I gotta take this job.
 <br>
 You kidding me? I mean, I&#39;m good with my hands, I don&#39;t mind dirt, and I have a high tolerance for fumes.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 If it makes you happy, then I&#39;m happy.
 <br>
 Steven, why is it everything that I love about you also grosses me out? You&#39;re so complicated.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You can start tomorrow.
 <br>
 But we&#39;re not driving in together.
 <br>
 That&#39;s too weird.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 All right, I gotta take off.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go have lunch with my new dad.
 <br>
 Oh, bring a camera get a picture.
 <br>
 Steven, you don&#39;t have any family pictures.
 <br>
 Well, we have some really good ones of my mom down at the county jail.
 <br>
 One full face, two profiles-- each one dated and numbered.
 <br>
 Oh, steven, you&#39;ve had the hardest life.
 <br>
 You know, I should probably be more generous and considerate with you.
 <br>
 But I am what I am.
 <br>
 Okay, we are going to make this the prettiest muffler shop ever.
 <br>
 Really, all I wanted was a &#34;grand opening&#34; sign.
 <br>
 And you&#39;ve got one in needlepoint.
 <br>
 Kitty that&#39;s so tiny.
 <br>
 Needlepoint is very hard work.
 <br>
 You never appreciate anything I do.
 <br>
 You should&#39;ve just married Betty Parker.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 What I meant was, it&#39;s so tiny, like your waist.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Eric, you want to hand me that manifold? The manifold.
 <br>
 Mani fold.
 <br>
 Man, I folded that.
 <br>
 Eric, are you ready to help me decorate? Yes, now I was thinking we could line this counter here with red-white-and-blue bunting.
 <br>
 How is it that I raised a son who knows &#34;bunting&#34; but not &#34;manifold&#34;? Well, maybe the problem is that you were never around.
 <br>
 I was always around.
 <br>
 Yeah, maybe I was the problem.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 4 &#34;Beast of burden&#34; I&#39;ve never been to a beauty salon.
 <br>
 I&#39;m excited to see how they make people beautiful Especially that lady over there.
 <br>
 That&#39;s gonna take some work.
 <br>
 Well, fez, I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;m gonna be here, so no wandering off.
 <br>
 You gave me a hell of a scare the other day at the mall.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not going anywhere.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just enjoying my time away from the DMV.
 <br>
 All those foreigners Learn to speak garbled english, people.
 <br>
 Well, the last time I was here, they were looking for help.
 <br>
 And they have no idea how weird you are.
 <br>
 That is an advantage.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the job? Shampoo boy.
 <br>
 Shampoo boy? You mean, I would get paid for touch hair? I used to get in so much trouble for that Hey! Don&#39;t touch me! What are you doing, man? What am I doing? What are you doing with your long, beautiful hair, you hippie freak? That&#39;s it! It is my destiny to be a shampoo boy.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Is there a job that pays you to eat pie No.
 <br>
 It is my destiny to be a shampoo boy.
 <br>
 Hey, mom, guess what hyde just told me.
 <br>
 if it&#39;s tawdry, I don&#39;t want to hear it.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Dad offered him a job at the muffler shop.
 <br>
 And did I even get an offer? No.
 <br>
 Like I wasn&#39;t there, too.
 <br>
 Like I wasn&#39;t all sore from hanging all that bunting.
 <br>
 Well, sweetie, don&#39;t take it so hard.
 <br>
 Your father&#39;s always had a soft spot for Steven, but he loves you, too.
 <br>
 I just know it.
 <br>
 Well, you know what I think? If dad loves Hyde so much, maybe he should marry him.
 <br>
 Honey, that&#39;s not possible.
 <br>
 Your father is already married to me.
 <br>
 What? No, mom, it&#39;s-- it&#39;s an expression.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s nota very good one.
 <br>
 &#34;Twenty three skeedow&#34; now, that&#39;s an expression.
 <br>
 Yes That&#39;s what I should to say.
 <br>
 Kitty, look I framed one of my &#34;grand opening&#34; flyers now if the shop&#39;s a success, I&#39;llhave a souvenir.
 <br>
 And if not, I&#39;ll have something to glare at while I&#39;m drinking that&#39;s a very good idea.
 <br>
 And you know what else is a very good idea? Offering Eric a job just like you did Steven.
 <br>
 Kitty, I can only afford to hire one person.
 <br>
 And why can&#39;t that one person be your very own son? Because my very own son can&#39;t do anything.
 <br>
 No that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 Just today he caught the most beautiful butterfly well if a giant butterfly is tearing up the shop I&#39;ll call eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not sure I want him to face a giant butterfly So, red, we got your muffler store flyer, and I&#39;m a little hurt.
 <br>
 You know, you never asked for my input.
 <br>
 I mean, I had a business on my own.
 <br>
 Bob, Your business went under.
 <br>
 Yeah, but very slowly.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t feel insulted, Bob Red wouldn&#39;t even give his own child a job.
 <br>
 If you have muffler shop, wouldn&#39;t you give Donna a job? Sure, Donna knows her way around the car.
 <br>
 But Eric thinks an exhaust belt is something that holds up your pants when you&#39;re tired.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no such thing as an exhaust belt, bob.
 <br>
 Well, then he thinks something else is something else.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know, when you start a new business,.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 You need a gimmick.
 <br>
 When I opened my store, I rented a monkey.
 <br>
 People will drive a hundred miles to see a monkey, 200 if he&#39;s wearing a suit.
 <br>
 And Bobby dressed up as Tarzan, and I dressed up as Jane Remember? Do I! &#34;Me, Tarzan, you, Jane.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just what I said.
 <br>
 Bob, I&#39;ll tell you what my gimmick is gonna be.
 <br>
 Good service at a fair price.
 <br>
 Oh, please.
 <br>
 Leave that stuff to the japanese.
 <br>
 Hey Geri.
 <br>
 This is Fez.
 <br>
 And he would like to apply for the shampoo boy job.
 <br>
 Yeah? Why do you wanna be a shampoo boy because I love hair--on the head, on the body, on floor, and if there&#39;s one in my salad, I enjoy it more.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Okay, maybe I got a little carried away.
 <br>
 The one on my salad-- I can take it or leave it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a little creepy.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re cute, so I&#39;ll test you on one of our regular clients.
 <br>
 Yes, that&#39;s great, Fez.
 <br>
 I have complete faith in you.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re gonna wash Donna&#39;s hair.
 <br>
 - Oh! Um, You know, I&#39;m kind of exclusive with paulette.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t just test him on anyone.
 <br>
 He seems kinda pervy.
 <br>
 She gets me.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 But nothing other than your hands touches nothing other than my head.
 <br>
 Oh, thank you, donna.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna regret this.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the first time I said that to a girl and meant it.
 <br>
 Well, thanks for lunch, man.
 <br>
 I gotta say, a burger just tastes better when it&#39;s bought for you by your new black dad.
 <br>
 So you must really love Led Zeppelin.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the oldest shirt I&#39;ve ever seen on someone who wasn&#39;t a bum.
 <br>
 Hey, If god didn&#39;t want me to wear it so much, he wouldn&#39;t have made them rock so hard.
 <br>
 Led Zeppelin&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 I caught &#39;em back in &#39;69.
 <br>
 Front row.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Oh, I did well with the ladies that night.
 <br>
 They probably thought I was jimi hendrix.
 <br>
 I told &#39;em I was jimi hendrix.
 <br>
 smile! Jackie, we&#39;re trying to have lunch here,do you mind? Who cares about lunch, Steven? We need a picture of a parent who&#39;s not under arrest.
 <br>
 Listen, the reason I wanted to see you is I was thinking that maybe you&#39;d like to come work for me.
 <br>
 I could teach you the record store business.
 <br>
 Well, I have stolen a lot of records.
 <br>
 I would like to learn why people pay for &#39;em.
 <br>
 You know what? I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I just took another job today.
 <br>
 Well, quit that job.
 <br>
 You come work for me, and we&#39;ll kick butt at the father/son picnic.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll even start a father/son picnic just so we can kick butt.
 <br>
 Man, that sounds really cool.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ll try and work it out.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I like to hear.
 <br>
 Hey! Well, steven, you&#39;re gonna need a picture for your christmas card.
 <br>
 So, uh, Hyde, when my dad offered you the job, I mean, what exactly did he say? Was it, like, um, &#34;since I don&#39;t see my own son here right now, &#34;I might as well just give you the job&#34;? I can&#39;t believe I got a job from my dad and from red.
 <br>
 Now I have two jobs.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like I&#39;m a workaholic.
 <br>
 I gotta tell you, that&#39;s not the kind of &#34;holic&#34; I thought I&#39;d be.
 <br>
 Wow, hyde, this is really gettin&#39; to you.
 <br>
 I mean, look at you you&#39;re leaning forward, you got your sunglasses off.
 <br>
 You&#39;re freakin&#39; out.
 <br>
 Well, this is an emotional time for my steven.
 <br>
 His new daddy and his substitute daddy are in a tug-of-war for his heart.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 I thought we established that hyde doesn&#39;t have a heart.
 <br>
 It was no heart, no brain, no courage.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just have to tell red I can&#39;t take the job.
 <br>
 I mean, he&#39;ll understand.
 <br>
 Wait, I&#39;m the scarecrow? He&#39;s the one who gets set on fire.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, that&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Steven, I have a little surprise for you.
 <br>
 Pretty nice, huh? They already had a bunch of patches that said &#34;steven.
 <br>
 &#34; But I had a &#34;Hyde&#34; one custom-made &#39;cause I know that&#39;s what you prefer.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Custom-made? He once got me a hat that said &#34;Erin&#34; because it was &#34;close enough.
 <br>
 &#34; Uh, thanks, Red.
 <br>
 This is- this is really cool.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you can buy your own pants.
 <br>
 Hyde - Why didn&#39;t you say anything? - Because he&#39;s torn between two daddies.
 <br>
 Steven, when you&#39;re in a moral quandary, do what I do, Okay? Put on some donny osmond, close your eyes and ask yourself one question-- who&#39;s richer? Okay, Fez, this is your station.
 <br>
 Donna, here&#39;s my pepper spray, just in case.
 <br>
 You owe me.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s see what we have to work with here.
 <br>
 Fez! Shouldn&#39;t you be doing something with soap and water? Oh, so you want it wet and soapy.
 <br>
 Fez, I just want my hair washed.
 <br>
 Oh, so you want to call the shots.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t do the &#34;so you want&#34; stuff.
 <br>
 - Oh, so you want it silent.
 <br>
 Fez! Okay, okay.
 <br>
 Showtime.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re about to experience some feelings.
 <br>
 My advice is give into them.
 <br>
 Hey, come on in.
 <br>
 Look around.
 <br>
 Heck, take a muffler if you like.
 <br>
 I&#39;m--I&#39;m just kidding.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t touch anything you&#39;re not gonna buy.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 Surprised to see you here.
 <br>
 Well, I just wanted to see why steven would take a job at a muffler shop instead of working for mein an office with air conditioning and a pension plan.
 <br>
 I guess white folks are just weird.
 <br>
 Man, he didn&#39;t even think about offering me the job, did he? Oh, well, honey, he just didn&#39;t think you were a good fit.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called &#34;Forman &amp; son.
 <br>
 &#34; It doesn&#39;t say whose son.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing? What? It&#39;s your first day on the job, and you&#39;re drinking? This is not summer camp, you know? There&#39;s drinking at summer camp? Look, if you&#39;re not responsible enough to handle yourself, then obviously,I made a big mistake.
 <br>
 I hope there&#39;s another job out there for you, because you&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 My dad told you he offered me a job, didn&#39;t he? What? No.
 <br>
 What? &#39;Cause I&#39;ve heard you fire a lot of people, and I&#39;ve never heard you say, &#34;I hope there&#39;s another job out there for you.
 <br>
 &#34; You say, &#34;I hope my foot &#34;doesn&#39;t get stuck in your ass.
 <br>
 &#34; Or, &#34;don&#39;t let my foot get stuck in your ass on the way out the door.
 <br>
 &#34; Or the classic, &#34;I&#39;m gonna stick my foot in your ass.
 <br>
 &#34; Just get outta here.
 <br>
 Thanks, red.
 <br>
 You&#39;re such a softy.
 <br>
 Are you lurking behind everything? Well, it&#39;s the only way I get to see your real emotions So guess you have a job to offer eric after all? Yeah, well, I guess I could teach eric something about cars.
 <br>
 Maybe if I told him they were called &#34;space mobiles,&#34; he&#39;d take to it.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you like to work for me? Here? With you? Wow, dad, that would mean a lot.
 <br>
 Then it really would be &#34;Forman &amp; son.
 <br>
 &#34; - So you&#39;ll take the job? - Hell, no.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 I mean, I don&#39;t want to work.
 <br>
 This is my year off.
 <br>
 Then why did you complain all day about not getting the job? Oh, well, mom, I just wanted to get invited to the dance.
 <br>
 I mean,I didn&#39;t want to dance.
 <br>
 Hell, I don&#39;t even know any of the steps.
 <br>
 Honey, you are a wonderful dancer.
 <br>
 Hey, man, Is that job still available? &#39;Cause red just fired me.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 The job&#39;s yours.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 When do I start? How about monday? Ooh, mondays are gonna be tough for me.
 <br>
 I find I&#39;m fresher if I start my work week on a tuesday.
 <br>
 Say, uh, some time after lunch? I&#39;ll see you monday at 9.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s call it 10.
 <br>
 Jackie, jackie, fez shampooed my hair.
 <br>
 And you were able to untie yourself and get away? No, Jackie, his hands were amazing.
 <br>
 At one point, it was like he had five extra fingers.
 <br>
 Well, donna,he is foreign.
 <br>
 He might.
 <br>
 Ladies.
 <br>
 Hi, Fez.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s official.
 <br>
 I am shampoo boy.
 <br>
 The word on the street is you need to smoke a cigarette after this boy lathers you up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the one who said that.
 <br>
 Fez, did you get taller? Well, I&#39;m gonna make an appointment.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not using the same sink as the old ladies.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;ll use the sink I tell you to use.
 <br>
 Okay, Fez.
 <br>
 Wow! Hey, Red.
 <br>
 This is goin&#39; great.
 <br>
 Ah, yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s going okay.
 <br>
 But can you imagine how great it would be going if he used the midget catering company I told him about? Yeah, well, uh, thanks, Bob, for not forcing some cock a mamy gimmick down my throat.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;d never do that.
 <br>
 Kelso, plan&#39;s off.
 <br>
 Get it outta here.
 <br>
 We got him for three more hours.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna see if I can teach him how to drive.
 <br>
 there&#39;s a butterfly in the backyard.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on it! Okay.
 <br>
 He&#39;s after me.
 <br>
 He&#39;s after me.
 <br>
 Crap.
 <br>
 That just made him mad.
 <br>
 <br>
