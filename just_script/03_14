 <br>
 But I drank all mine.
 <br>
 Keep it.
 <br>
 Hey, that&#39;s my soda.
 <br>
 Life is unfair.
 <br>
 Oh, swell.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Max from the radio station.
 <br>
 His ad rates bled me dry.
 <br>
 I got nothin&#39; to say to him.
 <br>
 Hiya, Max! [Chuckles] Oh, Bargain Bob! [Laughs] Hey, I&#39;m sorry you lost the store, man.
 <br>
 Sorry? I lost it by choice.
 <br>
 Yep, I&#39;m doing great.
 <br>
 Got the large fries, you know.
 <br>
 Large fries.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll see you.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, speaking of fries, you got any jobs down at the radio station? Oh, not for a guy like you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m currently looking for an office girl but usually my office girls are girls.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Donna.
 <br>
 The girl.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna! Listen, drop by the station and we&#39;ll see what we can do.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 Thanks! I could have been an office girl.
 <br>
 Aw, that does it.
 <br>
 This tastes like crap! May I help you, sir? Yeah.
 <br>
 I wanna compliment you on one tasty, fried piece of shoe.
 <br>
 Let me take care of this right now.
 <br>
 Earl! Oh, no.
 <br>
 - Did you say Earl? - Just one second.
 <br>
 Ricky, I&#39;m glad you called me.
 <br>
 I need to leave early for a- Oh.
 <br>
 Hi, Red.
 <br>
 You two know each other? I used to work for Red.
 <br>
 Then he fired me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Then he and I have something in common.
 <br>
 You&#39;re fired! What did I do? Hey, Bob.
 <br>
 Job just opened up for you.
 <br>
 [Stereo: Rock] Fez? What instrument&#39;s that? Instrument? Eric, I got a job! I&#39;m sorting records atJerry Thunder&#39;s radio show! No way! WFPP? That&#39;s Jerry Thunder! [Imitates Announcer] The Sound! And he knows rock stars.
 <br>
 And he gets free concert tickets.
 <br>
 And he gave me this guitar pick from Foghat.
 <br>
 No way! Eric, there&#39;s a whole pile of bumper stickers, and they&#39;re free! No way! Okay, well, I gotta go.
 <br>
 I gotta go alphabetize the eight-tracks.
 <br>
 No way! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Leo, man, this place is a mess.
 <br>
 Yeah? You should see my garage.
 <br>
 This is your garage, man.
 <br>
 Well, then you see what I mean.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a mess.
 <br>
 National GeograPhic is a beautiful magazine.
 <br>
 There is volcanoes and a gazelle.
 <br>
 And naked- Leo, man, there&#39;s a car in here.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s an El Camino.
 <br>
 ! - Ohh! Wow.
 <br>
 Do you think it&#39;s mine? The plate says &#34;Leo&#39;s.
 <br>
 &#34; No, I mean the car, man.
 <br>
 This guy, huh? - And this is where we do the interviews.
 <br>
 - [Rock] A lot of rock legends have puked in this room.
 <br>
 Good times.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 So, if I stay here long enough, I might see a rock star throw up? See it? You&#39;ll probably clean it up.
 <br>
 All right! - [Stops] - Oh, yeah, this is Jerry Thunder- - [ThunderclaP] - Coming to you on The Sound! And it looks like we got a new office girl.
 <br>
 What&#39;s your name, baby? Um, Donna.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 Well, Donna, you are hot.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna call you Hot Donna.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You got yourself a boyfriend, Hot Donna? Um no.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 ! That is good news, fellas.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause Hot Donna is hot.
 <br>
 ! [Resumes] Max, why&#39;d you make me say that? &#39;Cause I have a boyfriend.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You have a boyfriend.
 <br>
 So does Elton John.
 <br>
 No way! Yeah! They&#39;re a fantastic couple.
 <br>
 I love &#39;em.
 <br>
 The point is we&#39;re selling an image here and an available Hot Donna is good for ratings.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, what the hell.
 <br>
 Eric won&#39;t have a problem with this.
 <br>
 What the hell? I have a problem with this! Maybe she dumped you and forgot to tell you.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Thank you, Nairobi.
 <br>
 Look, Forman, I wouldn&#39;t read too much into this.
 <br>
 Donna probably just said she doesn&#39;t have a boyfriend &#39;cause she&#39;s ashamed of you.
 <br>
 Okay, baby, I&#39;ll see you later.
 <br>
 [Exhales] Listen, Forman, you&#39;re just upset because you know Donna is entering the really cool world of FM radio.
 <br>
 But, you know, feel good, man.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you&#39;ll be like that first sweet relationship she&#39;ll look back on fondly while she&#39;s on the tour bus straddling rock stars.
 <br>
 [Both Grunting] Yeah, life just hasn&#39;t been the same since I lost the van.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hard to get chicks when you don&#39;t have wheels.
 <br>
 I mean, sometimes a killer bod just isn&#39;t enough.
 <br>
 Amen to that, brother.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ll sell the El Camino to you for 500 bucks.
 <br>
 - 400.
 <br>
 - 600.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the wrong way.
 <br>
 Um- Uh 500.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Sold.
 <br>
 [Both] Sucker.
 <br>
 Eric, don&#39;t worry about this whole Donna thing.
 <br>
 I know a lot of girls who are much more realistic for you.
 <br>
 They might be a little heavy, or a little dumb, or have a cockeye, but- Jackie- she didn&#39;t break up with me, okay? - She still loves me.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re in the denial stage.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - See? Oh, my God, you guys! This has been the best day ever.
 <br>
 Jerry Thunder has totally taken me under his wing.
 <br>
 And his stories- he&#39;s so funny! Oh! Elton John has a boyfriend! Plus, I get to meet Alice Cooper.
 <br>
 Here it is.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna see if Alice&#39;ll sign this.
 <br>
 Oh, I can&#39;t make it to the movie tonight.
 <br>
 See ya.
 <br>
 See? She still loves me.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Have you met my friend Fat Sally? [Doorbell Rings] Earl.
 <br>
 What brings you here? Uh, I took the bus.
 <br>
 First off, Kitty, I&#39;d like to say you have a lovely home.
 <br>
 Second of all, screw you, Red.
 <br>
 What? I&#39;m out of work, and it&#39;s all your fault.
 <br>
 How am I supposed to pay my bills or feed my dog or go to Hawaii? Look, Earl you can&#39;t blame me for getting fired.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t make you too dumb to flip burgers.
 <br>
 That&#39;s God&#39;s fault.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you know the Christmas card you get of me and my dog every year? You&#39;re off the list.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t bother checking the mailbox, Red, &#39;cause it ain&#39;t comin&#39;.
 <br>
 I loved his Christmas cards.
 <br>
 They were handmade.
 <br>
 [Radio] This is Jerry Thunder comin&#39; at you on The Sound! We got Alice Cooper droppin&#39; by any minute and it is going to be wild! - [Rock] - This is Jerry Thunder- - [ThunderclaP] - Comin&#39; your way on The Sound where we are enjoying lots of sex, drugs and rock and roll.
 <br>
 Am I right, Hot Donna? You sure are, Jerry Thunder.
 <br>
 Radio people are the coolest! That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why you want to have sex with us all.
 <br>
 I really do! Hey, everybody, it&#39;s Alice CooPer.
 <br>
 ! Hey, Hot Donna.
 <br>
 Heard about you at the last big rock star meeting.
 <br>
 Hey, Ted Nugent and I were wondering- Did you ever break up with that loser boyfriend of yours? Not yet, Alice Cooper.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s my loser boyfriend right now.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Are you ready to go to the Price Mart ball? You hear that, everybody? The Price Mart ball.
 <br>
 [All Laughing] Hey, I got an idea.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t we feed your skinny boyfriend to the snake? - Okay.
 <br>
 - [All Laughing] [Radio: Rock] [Off] Damn you, Alice Cooper.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t seen Donna in two days.
 <br>
 She&#39;s been spending all of her time at the radio station.
 <br>
 This is a real problem.
 <br>
 Oh, here we go again.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s got a problem.
 <br>
 Well, you know what? Maybe I got a problem, man.
 <br>
 Did you ever think of that? Oh.
 <br>
 Man, Hyde, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Go ahead, man, Unload.
 <br>
 Actually, I&#39;m cool.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s how you do it.
 <br>
 You have a problem, and you hold it in, man.
 <br>
 Now, leather up, fruitcake.
 <br>
 I have a problem.
 <br>
 But I guess I&#39;ll keep it all inside.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys so, Leo agreed to sell me the El Camino for, like, 500 bucks.
 <br>
 So, what I need from you is Hey, I&#39;m Hyde.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t feel anything.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just a frizzy-haired robot.
 <br>
 Hey! I&#39;m Forman! I use the same voice to imitate everybody! It&#39;s just that l- l- Nothing.
 <br>
 - [TV] - Oh! Gilligan screwed it up.
 <br>
 He always screws it up.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t they just kill him? I don&#39;t think you&#39;re really mad at Gilligan, Red.
 <br>
 Admit it.
 <br>
 You feel guilty about what haPPened to Earl.
 <br>
 This has nothing to do with Earl.
 <br>
 The professor worked on that coconut radio for three months.
 <br>
 Now how the hell are they gonna get off that island? Oh.
 <br>
 Well, then I guess I was wrong.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why I questioned you.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll tell ya- something&#39;s going on with that Skipper.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t get that fat eating coconuts.
 <br>
 Jackie, you know I wouldn&#39;t ask you if this wasn&#39;t important.
 <br>
 Okay? But this is an El Camino.
 <br>
 That&#39;s Spanish for &#34;The Camino.
 <br>
 &#34; [Sighs] By accepting this check, you are agreeing to two things.
 <br>
 First, you will pay me back in full and you will be my slave for a week.
 <br>
 Meaning, like, your love slave? No.
 <br>
 More like an errand boy.
 <br>
 You mean, like your errand love boy? No.
 <br>
 Just errands.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Now, go get your car, and then come by my place.
 <br>
 I need you to hold my toes apart while I paint them.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Well, errand boy you just sold your soul for a car.
 <br>
 Who cares, Fez? Your soul is like an appendix.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even use it.
 <br>
 [Exhales] Kitty, about this burger- What? Is it burnt? Are you gonna fire me? Make me live on the street with the other hoboes? Kitty, let it go.
 <br>
 I do not feel guilty! All right! I feel guilty! He&#39;ll thank me when his tummy stops hurting.
 <br>
 [Laughs] So how are things with you and [Low-pitched] Hot Donna? Well, if you heard about Hot Donna then you heard that I&#39;m not her boyfriend.
 <br>
 The whole world heard that.
 <br>
 Well, people in Canada heard it.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, Canadians don&#39;t matter.
 <br>
 What matters is that you and Donna are okay.
 <br>
 Right? Mom, I don&#39;t even know if we&#39;re okay.
 <br>
 She&#39;s spending all of her time at The Sound with Jerry Thunder.
 <br>
 That reminds me of when I first started at the hospital.
 <br>
 Your father was concerned that I was spending way too much time down there with all these handsome doctors.
 <br>
 But, Mom, that&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 Doctors aren&#39;t important like deejays.
 <br>
 Okay, well, the point is your dad started showing up at the hospital to mark his territory and one of the doctors, who was getting a little fresh, got punched in the mouth.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Dad&#39;s so cool.
 <br>
 No, that wasn&#39;t cool.
 <br>
 It was embarrassing.
 <br>
 But you married him.
 <br>
 Yes, but it was embarrassing.
 <br>
 Still, you married him.
 <br>
 The point is, you have to trust Donna.
 <br>
 But Dad didn&#39;t trust you, and you married him.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? I can&#39;t talk to you.
 <br>
 Okay, I am here to withdraw my complaint about my overcooked burger.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t think you can do that.
 <br>
 - Well, I think I can.
 <br>
 - Of course you can.
 <br>
 The customer&#39;s always right.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;ll give Earl his job back? Well, the fry cook burnt off his finger this morning so sure.
 <br>
 By the way, don&#39;t have the fish sticks.
 <br>
 We haven&#39;t found it.
 <br>
 You hear that, Earl? You got your job back.
 <br>
 You can go to work.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 You mean right now? But I&#39;ll miss WKRP.
 <br>
 - Okay, man, here are the keys.
 <br>
 - Oh, bitchin&#39;! You know I was gonna give this car to my son on his 16th birthday.
 <br>
 But then my old lady took him and split.
 <br>
 Yeah, wow.
 <br>
 Sad story.
 <br>
 Keys, please? - I can&#39;t sell you the car, man.
 <br>
 - Oh, man! Ah, I guess I understand.
 <br>
 Thanks, man.
 <br>
 Hyde, I want you to have this car.
 <br>
 What? No! You just said that you couldn&#39;t sell the car.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not selling it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m giving it to him, man.
 <br>
 He&#39;s family.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the son I never had.
 <br>
 You just said you had a son! Yeah, and Hyde&#39;s the son I never had.
 <br>
 Hey, Leo, man, thanks.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the best.
 <br>
 The car, the love, the wicked burn on Kelso.
 <br>
 Hey, man, need a lift? - Eric, what are you doing here? - I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;m doing here, Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here to say who&#39;s who and what&#39;s what toJerry Thunder.
 <br>
 Eric, you can&#39;t talk toJerry.
 <br>
 He&#39;s on the air.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Then I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait.
 <br>
 But let me tell you something- I&#39;ll be fuming.
 <br>
 This is Jerry Thunder- - [ThunderclaP] - Signing off.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll see you around The Sound.
 <br>
 - [Rock] - [Eric] All right! Whoo! Let&#39;s get Mr.
 <br>
 Big FM Stud out here right now! Yeah! Big time! Eric, why are you being weird? Donna, I&#39;m gonna make a long story short.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here to kick a little deejay ass, so have a seat.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 And this must be the boyfriend, Eric.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Jerry Thunder.
 <br>
 You&#39;re Jerry Thunder? [Giggling] Well, that&#39;s just great! Check outJerry Thunder! [Laughing] Hey, you kids, the night is young.
 <br>
 You guys up for a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons? I&#39;ll let you be Mandar, the half-elf.
 <br>
 Oh, well.
 <br>
 Another time, perhaps.
 <br>
 Good night.
 <br>
 So, that&#39;s Jerry Thunder? It really turns me off when you&#39;re so insecure like this.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve been together long enough where it&#39;s either you don&#39;t get it or you don&#39;t trust me.
 <br>
 - No, Donna, I trust you.
 <br>
 - Well, then you don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 I finally have something that&#39;s really good in my life right now and if you can&#39;t handle that, then we have a problem.
 <br>
 So, Eric, do we have a problem? No, we do not have a problem.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I broke my nail on a Styx album, I didn&#39;t get to meet Alice Cooper and I am super pissed.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you know you have a really cool job.
 <br>
 Yeah, I do, don&#39;t I? REO Speedwagon&#39;s coming in next week.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna see if they&#39;ll sign my boobs.
 <br>
 Now we have a problem.
 <br>
 Okay, suddenly you&#39;re face to face with the Dragon of Fear.
 <br>
 No! I should have worn my Gauntlet of Ogre Strength.
 <br>
 Dumb! Any ideas, Mandar? Well, there&#39;s my Rod of Cancellation, but it&#39;s chancy.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, a girl once promised to play with us, but she didn&#39;t show up.
 <br>
 Cheer up, King Zintar the Great.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get out there and slay that dragon.
 <br>
