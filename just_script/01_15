<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 - You and Jackie did not do it.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 We so did it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always saying that you did it.
 <br>
 Kelso, she wears the pants, and they have never come off.
 <br>
 Look at my face.
 <br>
 This is a face that did it.
 <br>
 Holy smokes, I think he did it.
 <br>
 - Kelso did it! - I did it! Yeah.
 <br>
 Congratulations, man.
 <br>
 - Plus, you did it in record time.
 <br>
 - Yeah, you think? No, you moron.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve been kissing her ass for over a year.
 <br>
 Yeah, but that&#39;s over, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hard to explain to you kids that have never had sex before but when you&#39;re with a woman, something chemical happens to her.
 <br>
 Now, Jackie is totally different.
 <br>
 She&#39;s like my love slave.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m that good.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Hi, sweetie.
 <br>
 How are you? Actually, I&#39;m a little bit chilly.
 <br>
 But I left my coat up in the car.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get it for you.
 <br>
 Miss me.
 <br>
 Handy little thing, isn&#39;t she? Okay, that was so cool.
 <br>
 - Cool? - And by &#34;cool&#34; I mean &#34;wrong and stupid.
 <br>
 &#34; All right, shut up.
 <br>
 Wrestling&#39;s back on.
 <br>
 I love wrestling! Come on, you&#39;re not even fighting back.
 <br>
 Why would he fight back? Don&#39;t forget, this Saturday night pro wrestling is coming to the National Guard Armory in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 Watch Rocky Johnson take on 20 snarling midgets.
 <br>
 Now, back to the action.
 <br>
 Rocky Johnson&#39;s coming to Kenosha? Man, we gotta go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 I love midgets, man.
 <br>
 Eric, I need to see you up here.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ll be right up.
 <br>
 You are not going up? I&#39;ll go up when I&#39;m ready.
 <br>
 So I just said to myself: &#34;I don&#39;t care if all I have is dirty laundry and no money.
 <br>
 &#34;I&#39;m going home to see my parents.
 <br>
 Because I love them very much.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, my.
 <br>
 Well, will you look at these? Yeah, Mom, all the girls are wearing them.
 <br>
 Eric, where have you been? - Yeah, Eric, I called you five minutes ago.
 <br>
 - I was watching wrestling.
 <br>
 Did you take those books back to the library like I asked you? Yeah.
 <br>
 I took them back.
 <br>
 Then why did I see them in the backseat of your car? I took them back to the car.
 <br>
 Which means that they&#39;re practically at the library.
 <br>
 You know, Dad, I feel sorry for all the good kids who wanted to read those books.
 <br>
 That&#39;s who I feel sorry for.
 <br>
 Okay, it&#39;s five books.
 <br>
 A nickel a book.
 <br>
 Big deal, I&#39;m out a quarter.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not about the money, son.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about the rules.
 <br>
 And without rules, we might as well all be up in a tree flinging our crap at each other.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 The library closes in a half an hour, so get your ass over there.
 <br>
 Dad, you know, all my friends are downstairs so Hey, pal, I&#39;m not the bad guy here.
 <br>
 Now, you screwed yourself when you didn&#39;t return those books.
 <br>
 - Now go.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Did you say, &#34;no&#34;? Are you telling me, &#34;no&#34;? Is that what I&#39;m hearing? Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, dear.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Well, all right! You know what&#39;s interesting? No.
 <br>
 When you talk to Laurie, you actually have a conversation but with Eric, you just give orders.
 <br>
 Kitty, he said no to me.
 <br>
 He&#39;s getting older, Red.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s time you two developed a friendship &#39;cause if you don&#39;t, he&#39;ll move away and we&#39;ll never see him again.
 <br>
 Is that what you want? Red.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t be friends with Eric.
 <br>
 He&#39;s too twitchy.
 <br>
 Red, until I see you make some kind of effort I&#39;m just gonna keep bringing it up.
 <br>
 Threats aren&#39;t gonna work, Kitty.
 <br>
 In the middle of every newspaper you&#39;re reading every nap you&#39;re taking, every football game you&#39;re watching I&#39;ll be there talking.
 <br>
 Bob, I&#39;m thinking of starting therapy.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m gonna be Bye.
 <br>
 Therapy? That&#39;s for crazies.
 <br>
 You know, the unexamined self is an unfulfilled self.
 <br>
 How can you be unfulfilled? I put a roof over your head, I pay the bills, I take care of you.
 <br>
 - Yeah, but what do I do? - You fill out that sweater real nice.
 <br>
 You are so cold! What? That&#39;s a compliment.
 <br>
 Sit down, Laurie, have some ribs.
 <br>
 Mom, you know I&#39;m on my water and yogurt diet.
 <br>
 Okay, isn&#39;t this nice? My whole family together.
 <br>
 Mostly.
 <br>
 Having family fun.
 <br>
 Because that&#39;s what dinner is for.
 <br>
 Right, Red? Okay.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Eric what happened at school today? Why? What&#39;d you hear? What&#39;s wrong with you? I can&#39;t ask a simple question? Red, you need some potatoes.
 <br>
 Good job on returning those books.
 <br>
 Yeah, I returned the books.
 <br>
 Even though it was kind of stupid.
 <br>
 What? He said it was stupid, Daddy.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Eric, what are you gonna do this weekend? Me and the gang are gonna catch that wrestling match in Kenosha.
 <br>
 Now, isn&#39;t that something? Because a certain Mr.
 <br>
 Red Forman used to wrestle in high school.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 What I did then was real.
 <br>
 That stuff on TV, that&#39;s all an act.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I bet if the two of you went together, you&#39;d really enjoy yourselves.
 <br>
 Right, guys? - No, Mom, I don&#39;t - I&#39;m really busy So, you&#39;re going.
 <br>
 And I think everyone has room to grow but Bob is perfectly satisfied and says just being his wife should make me happy.
 <br>
 Midge, let me stop you right there.
 <br>
 I know we&#39;ve had only one session, but from what I&#39;m hearing everything you say is completely right and everything Bob says is completely wrong.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna like therapy.
 <br>
 I think therapy&#39;s gonna like you.
 <br>
 Jackie, what are you doing here? You hate wrestling.
 <br>
 Michael likes it, and anything that Michael likes, I like.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I like Michael.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s my girl.
 <br>
 Oh, barf.
 <br>
 Come on, watch your legs.
 <br>
 Taking the gang to the wrestling matches? I guess I&#39;ll just sit home alone tonight since Midge is going to some therapy thing.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be alone.
 <br>
 Get in the car, Bob.
 <br>
 Eric, give me the keys.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t I drive? Because I want to get there in one piece.
 <br>
 Hey, can we get a move on? If I Miss that 20-midget free-for-all, I&#39;m gonna be super pissed.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You drive.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 You know, on second thought you should drive.
 <br>
 After all, tonight I&#39;m just one of the gang.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t gonna work, you know? We&#39;re gonna kill each other.
 <br>
 Fine, kill each other.
 <br>
 Just do it together.
 <br>
 Both hands on the wheel, Eric.
 <br>
 - Dad, if you want to drive - No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just one of the gang.
 <br>
 Yield, damn it! That sign says, &#34;yield.
 <br>
 &#34; That&#39;s better.
 <br>
 Baby This is ridiculous.
 <br>
 When we get home tonight you better tell your mother we had a damn good time.
 <br>
 So far so good.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And now, I gotta go and spend $2 for a 10-cent beer.
 <br>
 Gee, I&#39;m so glad our dads came.
 <br>
 - At least yours is leaving you alone.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Poor Fez.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 There I was sitting in the kitchen.
 <br>
 Sitting in the kitchen, when, boom! She tells me she needs therapy.
 <br>
 Yeah, Midge and I had a beautiful thing, Fezzy then it all went wrong.
 <br>
 Yeah, Bob, women are hell.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you grab us all a beer and we&#39;ll talk it over? I could get you sodas, &#39;cause I know you&#39;re underage.
 <br>
 Bob, this isn&#39;t about us.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about you.
 <br>
 And you need friends.
 <br>
 And beer.
 <br>
 How stupid do you think I am? Why don&#39;t we grab a beer and we&#39;ll talk it over? No.
 <br>
 Then, Bob, you&#39;re on your own.
 <br>
 See how you drive people away? I&#39;m telling you, after my therapy session, I felt so loose.
 <br>
 Loose is good.
 <br>
 If you ask me, we could all do with a little tightening.
 <br>
 And tonight, my therapist is hosting an encounter group but I&#39;m too shy to go alone.
 <br>
 Well, too bad.
 <br>
 Kitty, please come with me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 No, thank you.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You know what this is a lot like? Like when you asked me to help you host the bake sale.
 <br>
 Only it&#39;s different, because I said yes.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a gathering of his souls in progress.
 <br>
 Over drinks.
 <br>
 Free drinks? I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 That&#39;s music to a mother&#39;s ears.
 <br>
 Okay, what&#39;s going on here? Okay, you see the guy getting in the ring? That&#39;s Rocky Johnson.
 <br>
 Man, he&#39;s the best.
 <br>
 The best? They&#39;re not even fighters.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s all tricks.
 <br>
 I could get up there right now and Goddamn, he dropped that guy right on his head! Yeah! That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I got him.
 <br>
 He ain&#39;t going anywhere.
 <br>
 One, two, three.
 <br>
 - The winner! - Get off me! I&#39;m the winner here.
 <br>
 Yeah! Man! - Hot in here.
 <br>
 - You poor thing.
 <br>
 - Is that better, sweetie? - Yeah! - Jackie, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 Michael, is it okay Jackie, what the hell is going on between you and Kelso? Look, Michael Kelso and I have made beautiful love.
 <br>
 I mean No.
 <br>
 - Why are you being such a doormat? - Look, I have to be nice.
 <br>
 What if he gets bored now? Bored? Jackie, he&#39;s gonna want to do it again.
 <br>
 So what you&#39;re saying is, I&#39;m totally in charge.
 <br>
 I mean, a partnership No.
 <br>
 I own him! I am the man.
 <br>
 Jackie No.
 <br>
 Thank you, Donna.
 <br>
 Good evening, sir.
 <br>
 I would like a refreshing cola, please.
 <br>
 And get me a beer, son.
 <br>
 Okay, Dad, sure.
 <br>
 And a beer for my dad.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna get me that beer, are you? What seems to be the problem, son? What&#39;re you doing? Don&#39;t just sit there! Get up, you big moose! Look, he&#39;s laughing at you! I give and I give and I give! Boo-hoo.
 <br>
 Get back in the ring! Come on.
 <br>
 Hey, this is fun.
 <br>
 Rocky Johnson.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Johnson, sir, can I get your autograph? Rocky! Eric, go in there and get your autograph.
 <br>
 No way, Dad.
 <br>
 The sign says, &#34;wrestlers only.
 <br>
 &#34; So? So, that&#39;s a rule.
 <br>
 As I remember, a great man once said to me: &#34;If we were to break the rules &#34;the world would just be filled with tree-climbing crapflingers.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah.
 <br>
 Follow me.
 <br>
 You want your autograph or not? There he is.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Johnson, you gave that team of midgets an ass whupping, sir! You pile drive a little guy and the whole crowd turns on you.
 <br>
 When you&#39;re standing there, wondering what they&#39;re booing about you get bit on the kneecaps.
 <br>
 Look at my knees.
 <br>
 Midget bites.
 <br>
 I wonder if you&#39;d mind giving my son an autograph.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No autographs.
 <br>
 Look, pal I might be the only guy in here who&#39;s actually killed a man.
 <br>
 Give the kid an autograph.
 <br>
 And then, no more autographs.
 <br>
 That&#39;s really nice.
 <br>
 Bringing your kid to a wrestling match.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ve got a son.
 <br>
 And one day, he&#39;s gonna become the most electrifying man in sports entertainment.
 <br>
 Yeah, good luck with that.
 <br>
 Wanna make that out to Red Forman? No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Eric Forman.
 <br>
 Capital E-R-I-C.
 <br>
 - Yeah, but see, his nickname is Red.
 <br>
 - No, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s Eric.
 <br>
 Stop kidding around, Red! You know, babe, a soda would taste pretty good right about now.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 A soda does sound pretty good.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll have a diet.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I&#39;ll have a root beer.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you want to go get it for me? Sweetie? Okay, let me clear it up for you.
 <br>
 Get me a soda.
 <br>
 Now! Did you see that? I&#39;m the man.
 <br>
 It all started about six months ago when Midgie got a subscription to Cosmo.
 <br>
 These group sessions are about testing your boundaries losing your inhibitions, and really sharing with the group.
 <br>
 Kitty, are you ready? Share a little, Mom.
 <br>
 Tell us how folding the dishtowels just right makes all our problems go away.
 <br>
 You want me to share? Okay.
 <br>
 Laurie, you&#39;re mean to your brother and you&#39;re screwing around at college.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t even see you unless you run out of clean clothes or need cash.
 <br>
 The fact is, you&#39;re an ungrateful, spoiled brat.
 <br>
 Well, thank you.
 <br>
 That was nice.
 <br>
 I love you, honey.
 <br>
 Well, I hope you&#39;re all as excited about this journey as I am.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s pair off.
 <br>
 Okay, we&#39;re leaving.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t get it, Kitty.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on? I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s going on.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a bad doctor.
 <br>
 A very bad doctor.
 <br>
 - Dad, thanks for letting me drive home.
 <br>
 - Thanks for not killing me.
 <br>
 You know, I just had a lot of fun tonight with you, Dad.
 <br>
 Yeah, me too.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 - Want some? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I wanna have a piece.
 <br>
 Yes! Who&#39;s the king? Who&#39;s the king? My neck! Gosh, Dad, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 Look, I had no Now who&#39;s the king? You are.
 <br>
 And it turned out this therapist was just obsessed with sex.
 <br>
 And this is a really difficult time for me.
 <br>
 The last thing I need is a doctor who doesn&#39;t take me seriously.
 <br>
 I need to find someone I can talk to, someone who will really listen.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Wanna go to a party? Okay.
 <br>
 <br>
