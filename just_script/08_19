<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Wow that was great.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad we stretched beforehand.
 <br>
 And I have to say, I was terrific.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ve never said this before Tracy, but you&#39;re the best lover I ever had.
 <br>
 You know I have never said this before Nicole, but you&#39;re the best lover I ever had.
 <br>
 I never said this before Susan you&#39;re the best lover I ever had.
 <br>
 My name is Lucy.
 <br>
 The one time people understand me I get the name wrong.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;d offer you a third sandwhich but you&#39;ve cleaned me out of meat and condiments.
 <br>
 And cheese-whiz.
 <br>
 Well now we&#39;re gonna have to use the artificial stuff.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me okay ? I want a guy I can&#39;t have, I can&#39;t stop stuffing my face.
 <br>
 I am a thin girl with fat girl problems.
 <br>
 Alright.
 <br>
 If Fez and Jackie get together, it&#39;s official She becomes Point Place sluttiest slut.
 <br>
 Well I think it&#39;s nice you wanna be with Fez.
 <br>
 He has turned into a fine young man.
 <br>
 And you never know with foreigners, they can go either way.
 <br>
 Come on Jackie, I know what&#39;ll cheer you up.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go down to the mall and make fun of all the people coming out of the Big&amp;Tall store.
 <br>
 Donna, if you need something from the Big&amp;Tall, just say so Well Kitty cardiologist said I don&#39;t have to take my heart pills anymore.
 <br>
 Well that is wonderful news.
 <br>
 Oh and you know what this means ? We can bring back fried cheese friday ! It&#39;s not good news Kitty.
 <br>
 I just bought a four month supply of heart pills I don&#39;t need now.
 <br>
 That&#39;s 200 bucks down the crapper.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just sell &#39;em ? You know, there&#39;s a seedy subculture that buys drugs for recreation I saw one time on an after school special Well you can&#39;t sell drugs, it&#39;s illegal.
 <br>
 And it should be, because people shouldn&#39;t have easy access to addictive substances that dull their senses.
 <br>
 I will be in the bath.
 <br>
 You know man, you can sell those pills.
 <br>
 No I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yes you can, you just have to find the right market.
 <br>
 Well who the hell is gonna want a bunch of heart pills ? Anybody here take procardiacs ? The doctor is in ! That &#39;70s Show - 8x19 - Sheer heart attack It is torture knowing Fez is with all these different women.
 <br>
 All I hear from his bedroom is &#34;Oh Fez, you&#39;re so hot&#34; And then he comes out of his room and goes off to his date.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 If the walls of Fez&#39; bedroom could talk.
 <br>
 Well, we probably wouldn&#39;t be able to understand them either.
 <br>
 You know if the walls in Fez&#39; bedroom could talk they&#39;d yell &#34;quit humping your Victorica Principal poster&#34; ! Oh.
 <br>
 Hey Fez Where&#39;s your skank of the day ? I worked a double yesterday.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m taking the day off.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m taking a break from the ladies altogether.
 <br>
 I knew it, he&#39;s gay ! I just won 20 bucks from Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman ! No, I&#39;m done sewing my wild oates.
 <br>
 Mostly because my oates can&#39;t take it anymore.
 <br>
 These tight jeans make my ass look great, but you pay the price up front.
 <br>
 So wait Fez uhm, what, no more one night stands ? Nope.
 <br>
 I just didn&#39;t find those meaningless flings satisfying.
 <br>
 I think I might be a one woman guy.
 <br>
 Do you hear that Jackie ? Fez is a one woman guy Yeah.
 <br>
 Surprising, but true.
 <br>
 Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, these jeans are splitting me in half.
 <br>
 Congratulations Jackie, he&#39;s all yours ! It&#39;s like you won the lottery.
 <br>
 Oh you know, a really crappy lottery.
 <br>
 Pretty cool huh That was on a slow day.
 <br>
 Imagine what we could make if we set up shop on Betty Grable movie night.
 <br>
 Steven, we&#39;re not setting up shop anywhere.
 <br>
 All I want to do is get my money back.
 <br>
 Just like after I bought Eric that baseball mitt.
 <br>
 Dumbass used it as a hat.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll just get your money back.
 <br>
 Now, where is the rest of the stash ? It&#39;s in the medicine cabinet and don&#39;t start calling the heart medicine the stash ! It makes it sound like we What&#39;s going on ? Oh.
 <br>
 Just having a little man-to-man talk.
 <br>
 About what ? Well uh Steven&#39;s getting a little older and he just had some questions Oh please.
 <br>
 He was married to a stripper.
 <br>
 If anything, he should be giving you advice.
 <br>
 See what you made me do ?! Now I&#39;m lying to Kitty about selling drugs.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it I&#39;m throwing those pills away.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t spend my retirement as a lying dope peddler.
 <br>
 No man, you&#39;re not a dope peddler.
 <br>
 You are champion of the people ! Now, where does Kitty keep those little plastic baggies ? So Fez, I hear you&#39;ve been with a different woman every night.
 <br>
 I just hope you&#39;re doing the gentlemanly thing.
 <br>
 &#34;Thank you&#34; cards never go out of style.
 <br>
 Actually Miss Kitty, I&#39;m hanging out my leather pants.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ready to be with the one woman I should&#39;ve been with all along.
 <br>
 Fez I told you a thousand times, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman and I are very happy together.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just kidding ! So, is this woman someone I know ? Yes ! And I know for a fact that she likes me Oh Oooohhh Fez I am so happy for you ! New love is exciting, I remember the first time I tried Peppermint Schnapps.
 <br>
 But I want to be the one to tell her so uhm so please don&#39;t tell anyone that we had this conversation.
 <br>
 I already forgot about it ! What ?! We just had it, pay attention ! No Fez, I can keep a secret.
 <br>
 For instance I never told anyone that I once caught Red wearing my nightgown to keep his legs warm.
 <br>
 Oh, oh you didn&#39;t hear that ! Yes I did, I was right here ! No I&#39;m just saying, your secret&#39;s safe with me.
 <br>
 Oh hey Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 What&#39;s up ? Fez is crazy about you ! Wai- What ? Really ?! Yeah ! Now I wasn&#39;t supposed to say anything but I hate when they drag things out on soap opera&#39;s.
 <br>
 Nothing happens Monday through Thursday, we all know Marlena&#39;s the killer ! Let&#39;s just sell these things and go home.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna be known as the pill-guy ! - Relax, you&#39;re not the pill-guy.
 <br>
 - Hey ! It&#39;s the pill-guy ! Smitty, keep it down ! Red, can you get me any diet-pills ? My wife&#39;s having trouble getting into the house.
 <br>
 Through the garage ! You think your wife is big ? My wife just took a job at the movie theatre.
 <br>
 As the screen ! Hey guys.
 <br>
 You come here to tell jokes or do business ? The way I see it, you guys got a condition, we got the product.
 <br>
 So quit yankin&#39; my crank and let&#39;s do this, huh ? So is there someplace that we can talk a little more private ? Certainly.
 <br>
 Step into my officeÂ Okay, this is what I&#39;ve been thinking.
 <br>
 You give us the rest of the pills and we give you two cases of beer.
 <br>
 Plus a couple of passes to our Friday-night bingo marathon and Medicare seminar.
 <br>
 What kind of deal is that ?! I come down here, sit in the sauna with you half-naked and this is what you offer me ?! Come on Red, let&#39;s hit the nursing homes.
 <br>
 Whow, whow, settle down kid, we&#39;re all friends here, let&#39;s work something out before we say things we don&#39;t mean.
 <br>
 And someone winds up dead.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just kidding, let&#39;s order a pizza.
 <br>
 I just wanna get this over with.
 <br>
 So Steven, shut up.
 <br>
 Cal, I&#39;m gonna sell you those pills at cost.
 <br>
 And Smitty for the last time, close your damn legs.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Fez likes me ! I mean you guys, this is everything I ever dreamed of.
 <br>
 Having said that I&#39;m really glad that my racist father isn&#39;t here to see us together.
 <br>
 Oh good.
 <br>
 You&#39;re all here.
 <br>
 I have some big news to tell you.
 <br>
 Unless it&#39;s that you&#39;re gay, I don&#39;t wanna hear it.
 <br>
 Shut up, Bjorn Borg ! Well Fez, what is it ? Well I finally figure out the one woman for me.
 <br>
 As a matter of factÂ she is here right now.
 <br>
 - Oh my GoooodÂ - Hi guys ! Caroline ! Caroline ! I haven&#39;t seen you since you tried to kill usÂ I just couldn&#39;t believe it when Fez called.
 <br>
 It was so nice to hear a familiar voice.
 <br>
 Oh you mean coming from outside you head ? OkayyyÂ the old me would&#39;ve ripped out your eyeballs and hung them from my rear-view mirror like dice.
 <br>
 But the new me just smiles and slaps the anger away ! How sexy is that ?! Uh Fez, you said you were a one woman guy.
 <br>
 Caroline&#39;s got like eight personalities.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll go to bed with her one night and wake up the next morning with like an 82-year old Portugese fisherman.
 <br>
 Hey, Caroline accepts me for who I am.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna accept her for who they are.
 <br>
 Fez, the last time you dated Caroline she chased you around the room with a corkscrew.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called foreplay, jerk.
 <br>
 Yeah nothing spices up the bedroom like a crazy woman who might suffocate you when you&#39;re asleep with a pillow.
 <br>
 Donna we were role-playing ! She was a sexy nurse and I was the guy she was trying to kill.
 <br>
 Red, do you need anything from the super market ? Yeah.
 <br>
 Graham Crackers that don&#39;t taste like cardboard.
 <br>
 I fought in two wars, I deserve name-brand cookies.
 <br>
 Well those are name-brand ! Look at the box, there is the Kubler Dwarves.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re out of plastic baggies already.
 <br>
 I swear I just bought a box.
 <br>
 WellÂmaybe you misplaced themÂ You know, you&#39;re always losing things.
 <br>
 Like aluminum foil, remember that time you lost the aluminum foil ? I sure do ! Hello ? Hello ? Is anybody there ?! That&#39;s the third hang-up today ! Oh and this afternoon someone called and asked me if I had &#34;the stuff&#34;Â.
 <br>
 Wait a secondÂ I saw a sixty minute piece on this the other day.
 <br>
 Missing baggies, mysterious phone callsÂ I know what&#39;s going on ! Kitty I can explainÂ Steven is selling drugs ! Yes he is ! Wow.
 <br>
 She&#39;s really putting away that pizzaÂ The last time I saw her this upset was when Reverend Brown told her that ugly people go to heaven too.
 <br>
 Sooo Jackie, can I get a slice of that ? No ! Okay.
 <br>
 I was only asking because it&#39;s mine ! - Jackie, look.
 <br>
 Fez and Caroline are never gonna last.
 <br>
 - Hi guys ! Well that was just bad timingÂ Why are you wearing a wedding dress ? Oh my God, did Fez propose to you ?! Not yet ! But he will ! And I wanted to show him what I look like.
 <br>
 Oh but you know, I was hoping he&#39;d be here cause I gotta get this back to the store before they realize I climbed out the dressing room window.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worryÂ I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll just knock of ten percent.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 and put it on the rack marked &#34;Previously worn by psycho&#39;s&#34;.
 <br>
 You have a sharp tongue.
 <br>
 It would taste great in a salad.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Fez chose that whack-job over me ! Jackie, the only reason Fez chose Caroline over you is because he doesn&#39;t have any idea that you like him.
 <br>
 - Well whose fault is that Donna ?! - Yours ! Oh, thank you for kicking me while I&#39;m down ! You know, Jackie if you worked as hard at getting Fez as you are at polishing off my pizza you&#39;d be pushing a little bilingual baby through the park right now.
 <br>
 Steven how could you ?! Just a product of my environment.
 <br>
 Wait, what are you talking about ? We know you&#39;ve been selling drugs out of the house, this is the worst thing you have ever done.
 <br>
 You have turned my living room into East St.
 <br>
 Louis ! So please, just admit what you&#39;re doing it&#39;ll be better for everybody.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not admitting anything.
 <br>
 Although if I were selling drugs, it&#39;s probably because I don&#39;t have a new What ? Steven, we do not reward this kind of behavior.
 <br>
 Right, Red ? Right A 13-inch TV should do the trick Why are you even discussing this ? If ever there were a time for your foot to be ankle-deep in someone&#39;s bottom, it&#39;s now ! Red, those pills sold like hotcakes ! We came by to give you your cut.
 <br>
 This is not a good time guys ! Red Forman, have you been selling your heart medication ?! Yeah ! They&#39;ve done wonders for me in the bedroom.
 <br>
 I&#39;m asleep before my wife comes in.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 I can take care of your problem here RedÂ no questions askedÂ I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 We should all have dinner sometimes.
 <br>
 Yeah well, thanks for coming by guysÂ RedÂ Look, I know what I did was wrong.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t you even want to know what I was gonna do with the money ? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I was gonna take you on a vacation to the Wisconsin dells.
 <br>
 Oh my God ! I feel like a Kennedy ! Ohhh, and the dells are three counties away.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna have to take the interstate ! Well that worked out pretty goodÂ You&#39;re going to the dells I&#39;m getting a new TV Yeah.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re gonna love watching that new show called &#34;Blow it out your ass&#34; Hey uh Fez, we need to talk.
 <br>
 Okay fine.
 <br>
 I used your deodorant because I wanted to see if it was strong enough for a man.
 <br>
 By the way, it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Uhm Fez you see when I heard you were ready to be with one woman I got really excited.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s because I thought you were talking about someone else.
 <br>
 Who ? Fez ?! Uhm, I can explain ! Go ahead.
 <br>
 Uhm, her tongue was in my mouth and then you walked in.
 <br>
 Youcheatingbastard.
 <br>
 Why do you make me do this to you ?! Not in the face ! Owww okay the face ! The face ! - How are you feeling ? - Not so good.
 <br>
 My face is freezing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really sorry this happened, but you&#39;re actually lucky that she&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 Jackie, what was that kiss all about ? Fez it&#39;s something that I wanted to do for a really long time.
 <br>
 And I was wondering You know hoping, that maybe you and I could be together.
 <br>
 You want to be with me ?! Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean Fez my life has been so crappy lately that you have been the one good thing.
 <br>
 Well.
 <br>
 So you want me because you&#39;re lonely ? Great, so that makes me what, your last resort ? - No Fez.
 <br>
 You&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s not - You know what Jackie, forget it.
 <br>
 You went to be with Kelso and Hyde.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna be your sloppy thirds.
 <br>
 Hey guys.
 <br>
 Want to cross some more of those heart pills.
 <br>
 Well actually, we have all we need.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Really ? Sure would be a shame if you ran out just when you needed it.
 <br>
 Like say you&#39;re driving your car and all of a sudden you find that your break lines have been cut.
 <br>
 Who would do that ? I don&#39;t know Maybe a guy who knows a guy.
 <br>
 But hey, if you guys don&#39;t need &#39;em, you don&#39;t need &#39;em.
 <br>
 Drive safe.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take 20 pills That&#39;s what I like to hear.
 <br>
 You did the right thing.
 <br>
