<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Here, Bernice, I made you a plate of leftovers.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 That reminds me, Red, my garbage disposal is still broken.
 <br>
 Just as long as you enjoy it.
 <br>
 Listen, I&#39;ve got an idea.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s eat out next Sunday.
 <br>
 That way everybody can get something they like.
 <br>
 Okay, Grandma, time to get you home.
 <br>
 Eric, you gotta warm that car up for at least 10 minutes.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a good boy.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a shame he doesn&#39;t have a better home life.
 <br>
 You know, Kitty, when I was raising children, the right way That&#39;s warm enough.
 <br>
 But you just said Show me tail lights.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s roll, grandma.
 <br>
 Turn off that beatnik music.
 <br>
 Watch the road.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t like it when I come to visit.
 <br>
 - Yes, I do.
 <br>
 I really do.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re a filthy liar.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t learn to lie from my Red.
 <br>
 That came from your mother.
 <br>
 See, Grandma, that&#39;s the problem right there, okay? Every time you come to my house you spend the whole day criticizing my mom.
 <br>
 - I tell it like it is.
 <br>
 - Okay, Grandma, then here&#39;s how it is.
 <br>
 You&#39;re very nasty.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t see why you have to be so hateful.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think being nice for a whole day would kill you.
 <br>
 Grandma? Grandma? Oh, God.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on? Just shooting some hoops.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 Eric, what&#39;s your grandma doing sleeping in the car? She&#39;s not sleeping.
 <br>
 She&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 No, really.
 <br>
 She&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 What? What are you talking about, she&#39;s dead? I was driving her home and then I yelled at her and then she died.
 <br>
 - She died? What did Red say? - I&#39;m not telling Red.
 <br>
 Eric, I don&#39;t mean to criticize, but are you insane? You need to do something.
 <br>
 Eric, I just gotta get my eight-track out of the car.
 <br>
 Kelso! Grandma Forman, can you just move your leg there? Kelso, she&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 My God! My God! Eric, you&#39;re in shock.
 <br>
 You have to go inside and tell Red, right now.
 <br>
 Wait, will you do it? Right now.
 <br>
 I forgot the Tupperware.
 <br>
 She sent back the leftovers.
 <br>
 This is so typical of your grandmother.
 <br>
 Why do I even put up with her? Mom, I think you might be coming down a little hard on Grandma this time.
 <br>
 You know what? She is just an evil, horrible little woman.
 <br>
 - What did she say about me this time? - Not much.
 <br>
 So, did you get your Grandma home, okay? You know, the strangest thing happened.
 <br>
 Okay, now here&#39;s the part where I get lost.
 <br>
 - How did she hit the sidewalk? - I opened the door for her.
 <br>
 What the hell was going through your head when you did that? Just yell at him, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure that his grandmother dying hasn&#39;t upset him enough.
 <br>
 Eric, take your mother in the house.
 <br>
 She&#39;s hysterical.
 <br>
 Yes, sir.
 <br>
 And I have to tell you, sir, when we were driving I said to Grandma Eric, this is no time to get upset.
 <br>
 When is the right time? I&#39;ll handle this, Eric, you just take your mother in the house.
 <br>
 Mom.
 <br>
 This is a terrible loss.
 <br>
 Mom, didn&#39;t you just say that she was evil? I never said any such thing.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Sweetie, I am so glad you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Yeah, I had a final this week.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry, honey.
 <br>
 No, this couldn&#39;t have come at a better time.
 <br>
 I was really unprepared.
 <br>
 But I miss Grandma.
 <br>
 I know, honey.
 <br>
 We all do.
 <br>
 Mom, what is with all this food? You know, busy hands are happy hands.
 <br>
 Say, would you like a cup of chili with your waffles? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 So, how did your brother take the news? You know Marty.
 <br>
 He was talking about his feelings and then he started bawling, so I hung up on him.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not paying long distance rates to listen to that crap.
 <br>
 Uncle Marty is so in touch with his feelings.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s like he&#39;s completely self-actualized.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s a dumb ass.
 <br>
 Now, Red, honey I don&#39;t think that you&#39;re really mad at Marty I think you are just going through one of the five stages of dealing with death.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? There are five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;ve got two stages: anger and drinking.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care what you said to your grandmother you did not kill her.
 <br>
 I did, Donna.
 <br>
 I killed her.
 <br>
 She was old and the shock of her grandson telling her that she was nasty killed her.
 <br>
 - Have you talked to Red about this? - I&#39;m not talking to my dad about this.
 <br>
 Do you remember how angry he got when I didn&#39;t rake the yard? And this is, like, twice as bad.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t really want to talk about this anymore.
 <br>
 Eric, you need to talk about this.
 <br>
 Donna, we don&#39;t talk about things in the Forman family.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like your house, where every time you have a &#34;feeling&#34; your dad gives you a big hug and a gold star.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m just trying to help you here.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t Talking isn&#39;t gonna help me, okay? What&#39;s gonna help me is, like, drinking.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re just being stupid.
 <br>
 - Forman, let&#39;s go get wasted.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 See? Hyde&#39;s a real friend.
 <br>
 He&#39;s gonna help me get through my grandma&#39;s death.
 <br>
 Your grandma&#39;s dead? Man let&#39;s go get wasted.
 <br>
 As fellow human beings, not brothers human beings, how do you feel? What the hell is wrong with you? I got away from this family.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not afraid of my feelings.
 <br>
 I am.
 <br>
 Okay, now, who would like a Monte Cristo? Kitty, groovy sandwiches.
 <br>
 - No red meat, right? - No.
 <br>
 Just ham.
 <br>
 You know, Marty, we really should talk about Ma&#39;s funeral.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s on me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a round of beers.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll split the cost.
 <br>
 Sweet Red.
 <br>
 So generous.
 <br>
 Even when you&#39;re low on funds.
 <br>
 I just want what&#39;s best for Mom.
 <br>
 Yeah, Marty, that&#39;s what we all want.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that when I feel bad I don&#39;t cry like a little girl.
 <br>
 Waitress! Waitress! Forman, relax, okay? Hi.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna need a pitcher and four glasses, please.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna need to see some ID.
 <br>
 Of course.
 <br>
 I have mine right here but the rest of the fellas left theirs back at the military base.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Gotcha.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re in the military.
 <br>
 - What base are you from? - It&#39;s a secret military base.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Charlotte, and this is my sister, Charlene.
 <br>
 Hi, I&#39;m Ted.
 <br>
 Sgt.
 <br>
 Shaft.
 <br>
 You can call me Honcho.
 <br>
 I am Eric Forman.
 <br>
 Sally, put that on our tab.
 <br>
 And bring everybody a round of shots.
 <br>
 - What is going on? - They&#39;re picking us up.
 <br>
 No! - No, it&#39;s a good thing.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Excuse me, fellas, but we need to talk to the ladies.
 <br>
 - Yeah, these ladies are with us, okay? - They came here with us, okay? - Great.
 <br>
 - Get lost.
 <br>
 They are trying to pick us up.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;ve had quite enough firewater there, chief.
 <br>
 You mess with Eric Forman and you mess with me.
 <br>
 Are you looking for trouble? Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking for trouble.
 <br>
 Anybody else? There&#39;s three of us, so yeah.
 <br>
 So, where were we? Yes.
 <br>
 You were picking me up.
 <br>
 Now, where is Eric? It&#39;s 2:00 a.
 <br>
 m.
 <br>
 I&#39;m worried sick.
 <br>
 Eric is acting out.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t have the emotional tools to deal with this tragedy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re an emotional tool, Marty.
 <br>
 Now, who would like lemon bundt cake? Where the hell have you been? I went to a bar.
 <br>
 Eric, have you been drinking? - No.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been fighting.
 <br>
 - My lord.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - Just let the feelings out.
 <br>
 - Put them back in there, Eric.
 <br>
 - You know, when a father and son - Marty, you are this close to a headlock.
 <br>
 Goodnight.
 <br>
 Eric, just because there has been a tragedy in the family it&#39;s no reason to act crazy.
 <br>
 My son getting in a bar fight like some kind of bar-fighter.
 <br>
 Kitty, stop cooking and go to bed.
 <br>
 Okay, all right.
 <br>
 When the timer goes off one of you better take that roast out of the oven or there will be hell to pay.
 <br>
 Sit down, Eric.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t drink that, put it on your eye.
 <br>
 Come on, I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 So, this is beer.
 <br>
 And as much as we all miss Bernice we must remember that she is now in a far better place.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to die to get to a better place, man.
 <br>
 - Just drive 50 miles in any direction.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 Are you okay? I don&#39;t know, Michael.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that death is so unexpected.
 <br>
 And we are such fragile beings never knowing when the flame of our lives will be blown out by the wind of death.
 <br>
 What? I am so turned on, aren&#39;t you? - Okay.
 <br>
 - Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 - Car? - Coat room.
 <br>
 Better.
 <br>
 I know we had our differences.
 <br>
 I married Red and you hated me.
 <br>
 Just try to be nicer to God.
 <br>
 Life is so complicated.
 <br>
 You get old and die.
 <br>
 Thank God I&#39;m still young and hot.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re just gonna throw that ring away.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 My God, there is a body in here.
 <br>
 Well, Ma Oh, for God&#39;s sake.
 <br>
 Sorry, those should be closed.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 God, you got a black eye.
 <br>
 It looks pretty hot.
 <br>
 - You should see the other guy.
 <br>
 - Did you really lay him out? No, I mean, he was huge.
 <br>
 I mean, you should have seen him.
 <br>
 The fact that I even took the punch is a testament to how tough I really am.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, I&#39;m sorry about the other night.
 <br>
 I was acting crazy and I&#39;m completely over it now.
 <br>
 I mean, you can&#39;t dwell on these things.
 <br>
 - So you had a heart-to-heart with Red? - Hell, no.
 <br>
 - So you&#39;re still just suppressing everything.
 <br>
 - Sure beats dealing with it now, right? Yeah.
 <br>
 Hug? I&#39;m really sorry your mom died.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, like, sad and stuff.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Pretty great funeral.
 <br>
 Red, I&#39;m sorry about your mom, man.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sorry Kelso&#39;s an idiot.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Red, always remember a mother&#39;s goodness is carried down forever by her sons.
 <br>
 Have you met my sister, Marty? What&#39;s all this stuff? Cameras.
 <br>
 My dad was an amateur photographer.
 <br>
 Had his own darkroom.
 <br>
 Really? Forman, you have any naked pictures of your grandma? No! You do now.
 <br>
 My old train set.
 <br>
 Your train set? That was our train set.
 <br>
 Really, it should have been mine.
 <br>
 You never played with it, right? Red do you want to keep the trains? - If you don&#39;t want them.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s not about me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about what you want.
 <br>
 Make an honest declaration of your needs.
 <br>
 Would you cut the crap? Just say to me, &#34;Marty, I want the trains.
 <br>
 &#34; Marty I&#39;d be glad to hang on to them for you.
 <br>
 - Are you asking me for them? - No! Fine.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll keep them.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Go ahead and keep them.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want the damn things.
 <br>
 Kitty, you go in there and tell that bastard to give me my trains.
 <br>
 Red, it&#39;s your problem.
 <br>
 I gotta make a pie.
 <br>
 Now see.
 <br>
 - Marty left you the trains.
 <br>
 - Yeah, he did.
 <br>
 And he even set it up right.
 <br>
 See, the stations are all spread out.
 <br>
 Five stops, five times the fun.
 <br>
 But if he thinks he&#39;s playing with them when he visits he&#39;s got another think coming.
 <br>
 Now, Red, you have to share with your brother.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I am gonna go make a coffee cake.
 <br>
 Dad, nice trains.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, I can&#39;t believe that your grandma held on to them all these years.
 <br>
 I thought she&#39;d thrown them away.
 <br>
 - Yeah, she was a good egg, Grandma.
 <br>
 - Yes, she was.
 <br>
 You know, when I was a little boy, I hated peaches and Mom knew that.
 <br>
 So whenever she made a peach pie she&#39;d make a little blueberry pie.
 <br>
 Special, just for me.
 <br>
 You know, she was the first one to call me Red.
 <br>
 And the last time I saw her I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t say, I love you I didn&#39;t even say good bye.
 <br>
 I said, &#34;Show me the tail lights.
 <br>
 &#34; Dad the last thing I said to her was: &#34;It wouldn&#39;t kill you to be nice.
 <br>
 &#34; But I think it did, because she died.
 <br>
 That could only happen to you, son.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the matter, Kitty? I&#39;m all out of eggs and flour.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 Eric, come here.
 <br>
 Do you think these diamonds are real? Family moment.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll leave you three alone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just gonna wait over here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really sorry that our last conversation didn&#39;t go so smooth.
 <br>
 But look, that is not how I feel about you at all.
 <br>
 Then why did you kill me, Eric? I&#39;ll never forgive you.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing out here? Freezing my nads off for a joke, man.
 <br>
 <br>
