<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey dad, can I go to Vanstock with the guys this weekend? What the hell&#39;s a Vanstock? Well, it&#39;s like Woodstock, but, with a greater emphasis on vans.
 <br>
 Sounds stupid.
 <br>
 Have a good time.
 <br>
 Oh, then daddy, since Eric is going out of town, can I have his car? Why? Where are you going? Excuse me, I was talking to daddy.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Where are you going? Frat party.
 <br>
 Frat party? No.
 <br>
 But daddy Look, honey! It&#39;s up to Eric.
 <br>
 Really? Well, I mean I guessNO! Well that&#39;s settled, then.
 <br>
 Red, what are you gonna do today? Well, read the want ads, look for a job, then just to break up the day I thought I&#39;d go down to Recksol, look for some Gold Bond for my athlete&#39;s foot.
 <br>
 Any more questions? Well, oh boy, Red, we&#39;ve got the big hospital banquet to look foreward to.
 <br>
 Oh, right.
 <br>
 Well, then.
 <br>
 Screw the Gold Bond, I gotta get my hair done! Well honey, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be that bad.
 <br>
 And, if it is, I can always give you a shot of Demerol.
 <br>
 You have Demerol? I mean, what&#39;s, what&#39;s Demerol? So! Donna and I are all set for Vanstock.
 <br>
 Whoa! No-Donna can&#39;t come with us! Why not? Well, it&#39;s kinda complicated Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 So what time are we leaving for Vanstock? No! Yeah.
 <br>
 No! Yeah! No! I guess you should have given me your car, Eric.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;ll be with you and Kelso all weekend.
 <br>
 How could you ask Laurie? Well, Jackie didn&#39;t wanna go.
 <br>
 What choice did I have? Aw, man.
 <br>
 See, now you see my problem.
 <br>
 Since Laurie&#39;s going, I&#39;m gonna have to make out with her.
 <br>
 And if Donna goes she&#39;s gonna see me making out with Laurie and then tell Jackie! Therefore, Donna can&#39;t go! Or, you could just not make out with my sister.
 <br>
 Be serious, Eric.
 <br>
 Ok, look.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s coming, and if that blows your weekend then, too bad.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But you know what? You&#39;re making cheating a lot harder than it has to be.
 <br>
 Kitty and I used to watch the soaps all the time.
 <br>
 So now it&#39;s like you&#39;re Kitty.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you have a TV at home? It&#39;s too big.
 <br>
 I have to turn my head to see who&#39;s talking.
 <br>
 It hurts my neck.
 <br>
 Ooh! Shh! Shh! It&#39;s starting.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 That&#39;s Heather.
 <br>
 She&#39;s carrying Jeff&#39;s baby only Jeff is in intensive care, he&#39;s got a bullet in his brain.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t he the lucky bastard.
 <br>
 Donna, check it out.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been working on this all morning and I&#39;m pretty proud.
 <br>
 I zipped our two sleeping bags together to make one.
 <br>
 Look, uh, throw your stuff in the back, I&#39;m gonna go get some snacks for the road.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Oh! Hi! Donna.
 <br>
 So, that&#39;s the carpet.
 <br>
 I was just showing Laurie the carpet.
 <br>
 I need some help with my stuff.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna give her some help with her stuff.
 <br>
 Well, I hope you like tuna fish sandwiches, &#39;cause that&#39;s all we got.
 <br>
 I just saw Kelso and your sister making out in the van.
 <br>
 Oh, no, that&#39;s uh Did you know about this? Did I? Uh, no! No! I didn&#39;t know about this! Hey, Hyde! Dona just saw Kelso and Laurie making out! So? Aren&#39;t you shocked? I&#39;m shocked! For one to have learned about this! Hey guys! I decided to go! I thought it&#39;d be fun to surprise Michael.
 <br>
 That would be fun! Um, Jackie, look, you know, before we surprise Kelso, there&#39;s something going on that you should know.
 <br>
 What? You know, vanstock is gonna be really boring, and it&#39;s gonna be muddy, and you know there&#39;s a good chance there&#39;s gonna be some Canadians there.
 <br>
 Eeeew!!! No, no, Jackie, you should go.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t let the Canadians win! Fez, put my stuff in the back.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 You know what would be the perfect surprise for Kelso? We&#39;ll pull the curtains, and you hide in the back with us.
 <br>
 And at some point, you jump up front and yell surprise! Oh my god, that is perfect! Now, hop in the van before Kelso sees you.
 <br>
 Hurry up! Oh, this may be the best road trip ever.
 <br>
 So, you wanna shift? It&#39;s an automatic.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Surprise! -- Brad.
 <br>
 How could you sleep with my wife? You&#39;re my brother.
 <br>
 --I&#39;m not your brother.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not Brad.
 <br>
 Holy cow! I didn&#39;t see that coming.
 <br>
 Wait&#39;ll Rachel finds out! But Rachel&#39;s about to dump Brad for Jeff! No! Jeff&#39;s in a coma! Oh, come on, Midge.
 <br>
 She can&#39;t love a guy in a coma? What the hell kinda love is that? Look at this.
 <br>
 Jackie brings four different types of mascara just to please Kelso.
 <br>
 And what does Kelso bring? An other woman.
 <br>
 Fez, you should really stop going through other people&#39;s stuff.
 <br>
 It&#39;s kind of creepy.
 <br>
 So, how long do you think this whole thing has been going on? Whoo, I, you know, I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess.
 <br>
 Right, Fez? What? Kelso and Laurie! See, ha, Fez doesn&#39;t even know! I don&#39;t know, I gue-you know, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s like, god, this is so wrong, you know? So what are we gonna do? I guess just let this all blow over.
 <br>
 Then Jackie and Kelso can get married, have kids, and be really unhappy.
 <br>
 So! Let&#39;s not let this ruin our vanstock experience, ok? Look at this.
 <br>
 Bubble gum LipSmacker.
 <br>
 What a waste.
 <br>
 So, you kids having fun? Nothing like a road trip to get to know each other.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Like, Jackie and Laurie.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t really know each other, and yet, they have so much in common.
 <br>
 Like what? Oh! Well, you both have really neat hair.
 <br>
 He&#39;s right! I love your hair.
 <br>
 What do you use? Hot rollers.
 <br>
 So do I! I hate styling wands.
 <br>
 So do I! See? You two keep talking.
 <br>
 There may be plenty of other things that you have in common.
 <br>
 No! No talking.
 <br>
 It makes the driver nervous.
 <br>
 So just everybody not talk.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just sing songs.
 <br>
 Who knows the words to &#34;Three&#39;s Company?&#34; I do! No singing! Come and knock on our door Come and knock on our door! We&#39;ve been waiting for you We&#39;ve been waiting for you! Where the kisses are hers and hers and his three&#39;s company too! Wow, man, Vanstock! It&#39;s exactly how I pictured it! Has anyone seen my top? I lost my top! Actually, it&#39;s even better than I pictured it! Do not take the blue acid! If you have taken the blue acid, please report to the red cross tent! Look at this debauchery.
 <br>
 This is the smelly underside of a once great nation.
 <br>
 Ooh, yum! Candy apples! Hey, man! What&#39;d you say we go help that chick find her top? Nah, gotta stay here with the old balls and chains.
 <br>
 You know, Kelso, did you ever think about being honest with them? Maybe they won&#39;t be mad? Maybe, they&#39;ll like the idea of sharing you! Man, that&#39;d be great, huh? You think they&#39;d go for that? Cause that&#39;s been, like-Oh ho no! You&#39;re trying to set my up, Hyde! You never know if you don&#39;t try, man! Are you serious? Be serious, &#39;cause this is serious.
 <br>
 This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid and saw &#34;The Parent Trap.
 <br>
 &#34; There you go! Ok! We&#39;re heading off to the restroom! Ok.
 <br>
 Oh, man, they&#39;re going to the restroom? You know what girls do in the restroom, right? Oh, I like to pretend like they don&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 Not that, man, they talk! So? To each other! Oh my god! Girls! Wait up! What a maroon.
 <br>
 Well, Red, this is Doctor Browning, and uh, Doctor Cloak.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re Kitty&#39;s husband, eh? She&#39;s a little spitfire! We couldn&#39;t run the ward without her.
 <br>
 Oh, well, you could, but everyone would die! Ah, so Red, uh, what do you do? About what? Um, uh, Red used to be in management at the auto parts plant.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Uh, what do you do now? About what? Oh my gosh, Red look, they have an open bar! No, he&#39;s not his brother! He&#39;s not even Brad! But he looks just like him.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the point.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t understand why you watch if you&#39;re not gonna pay attention! I&#39;m sorry about Red.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just, he&#39;s been a tiny bit cranky since he lost his job.
 <br>
 Kitty, it&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 I know, everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 He just um, he, he sits around and he mopes all day.
 <br>
 He, he once told me that if he ever started watching soaps I should shoot him, and I gotta tell ya, I am gosh darn tempted! Well, you know, when my wife is upset, I do something extra special for her, like surprise her with some candy.
 <br>
 Does Red have a sweet tooth? Um, no, no, uh, more of a beer tooth.
 <br>
 Oh, for god sakes.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a nurse and you can&#39;t love a guy in a coma? What the hell kind of hospital is this? Wow, look at the stars.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Your sister&#39;s kind of a slut.
 <br>
 I noticed that.
 <br>
 How is it that she turned out so awful and you turned out so nice? Ah, wellyou seeOk, Donna, there&#39;s something you should know.
 <br>
 Oh my god, you&#39;re pregnant.
 <br>
 It&#39;s nice to laugh, isn&#39;t it.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause, I kinda knew about Kelso and Laurie all along, and didn&#39;t tell you.
 <br>
 Excuse me? Which was wrong, but now I&#39;m being honest, which is right, right? Get out of this bag.
 <br>
 No, wait, Donna, just, please listen- Fine, I&#39;ll get out.
 <br>
 Oh, this is the worst vanstock ever! And now, another episode ofPoint Place.
 <br>
 My god Kitty.
 <br>
 What have I become? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not the man I married! And I&#39;m not Kitty.
 <br>
 What are you saying? I am Kitty.
 <br>
 But I am leaving you for Dr.
 <br>
 Cloak.
 <br>
 Or should I say, Eric&#39;s real father.
 <br>
 But why? He has a job.
 <br>
 What do you have, Red Forman? What do you have? I&#39;ve got nothing.
 <br>
 Dear god.
 <br>
 Will I ever work again? Ok! I&#39;m back! So.
 <br>
 Penny for your thoughts.
 <br>
 Well, one thing I&#39;m thinking.
 <br>
 I gotta stop watching the soaps.
 <br>
 Well, I think that is a good idea.
 <br>
 Ha! So listen, um, I brought you home a special little treat Ohhh!  Ahh! Hey! That&#39;s a nice beer! Yes it is.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the occasion? It&#39;s um, to celebrate your new job.
 <br>
 But Kitty.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t get a job.
 <br>
 Not yet, but I know you will! Thanks sweetie.
 <br>
 Tell you one thing.
 <br>
 I bet I get a job before Jeff gets outta that coma.
 <br>
 Hey, how&#39;s it going? Well, uh, found the top, just lost the girl.
 <br>
 Bummer.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 What are you doing up? Punishing Eric.
 <br>
 Knew all about Kelso and Laurie.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t even tell me.
 <br>
 What a bastard.
 <br>
 Oh, like you didn&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Of course I knew.
 <br>
 Everybody knew.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the only one that didn&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Shut up Hyde, I&#39;m mad at him.
 <br>
 Look, you don&#39;t rat on your friends.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just the way it is.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m laying traps left and right trying to get Kelso caught.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not gonna tell on him, cause then I&#39;d be a rat.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s what Forman would&#39;ve been if he had told you.
 <br>
 He still shoulda told me.
 <br>
 Give him a break, Donna.
 <br>
 I mean, the guy kisses your ass.
 <br>
 He does everything for you and you&#39;re not even sleeping with him.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lucky he even talks to you! In fact, I would have dumped you months ago! But you know, I&#39;m old fashioned, so Ok, Hyde, thanks for the heart to heart.
 <br>
 Ah, get bent.
 <br>
 Alright, well, I&#39;m off to find the jugs that fit this top.
 <br>
 Like Cinderella.
 <br>
 Excuse me, miss? Yeah, who is it? It&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 Laurie.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Good evening Michael.
 <br>
 Well, aren&#39;t we all cozy.
 <br>
 So! Where am I gonna sleep? Uh, gee Kelso, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any room.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s my van! I can sleep with you anytime! Tonight, I&#39;m really enjoying girl talk with Laurie! And why does he get to stay? Well I am not a girl, but I do enjoy the girl talk.
 <br>
 Get outta the van, Fez! No, be nice to Fez! Go away, Michael.
 <br>
 Shut the door.
 <br>
 Hey! Move over.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not mad at me anymore? Nope.
 <br>
 So, what are you thinking? That Kelso&#39;s an idiot and if I say anything to Jackie, it&#39;ll hurt her.
 <br>
 Yes, exactly.
 <br>
 And you know what else? You&#39;re like, a really great boyfriend.
 <br>
 All right! Well, all right! Thank god I found you guys.
 <br>
 I&#39;m freezing.
 <br>
 Scoot over.
 <br>
 What? Kelso! No! Wow, this is a roomy bag, huh? Sorry if I&#39;m a little wet.
 <br>
 What the hell is that smell? Oh, I found these two dogs, and we started wrestling, man, it was so cool.
 <br>
 All right, goodnight.
 <br>
 No, Kelso, get out! Get out! - You smell like a dog! - That smell! Get out! Well where am I supposed to sleep? No one cares! Fine! Ok, this is nice!
 <br>
