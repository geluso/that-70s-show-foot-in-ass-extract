<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 I think we have a really big shoplifting problem.
 <br>
 I just did inventory, and there are 30 records missing.
 <br>
 Oh, Angie, I forgot to tell you, I moved those to the annex, otherwise known as my house.
 <br>
 Excuse me, Mr.
 <br>
 Record store big shot, I need some help.
 <br>
 Where can I find something by Bette Midler? Well, we don&#39;t have any Bette midler, but may I suggest something even better? Perhaps a little Sex Pistols.
 <br>
 Sex pistols? Well, that&#39;s terrible.
 <br>
 Guns don&#39;t belong in the bedroom.
 <br>
 They agree, and a lot of their songs are about just that, and they deliver their message with a smooth, mellow sound.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s like easy listening.
 <br>
 Well, they&#39;re not hard to hear.
 <br>
 Steven, the store is great.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m proud of you.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Whoa, Hyde, I want you to really savor this moment.
 <br>
 Red&#39;s only nice every 75 years.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 He&#39;s kind of like the Halley&#39;s comet of compliments.
 <br>
 I got one the first time I used the potty and Yeah, since then, nothing.
 <br>
 What am I supposed to do, compliment you every time you go to the can? See? All these kids wasting their money on records.
 <br>
 You think they could be down at my muffler shop buying mufflers.
 <br>
 You&#39;re all stupid.
 <br>
 If you want, I could plug your store on my next radio show.
 <br>
 That would be great, and tell them I&#39;m giving away calendars.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, the only problem is I don&#39;t know how many people will hear it.
 <br>
 I used to think I had a lot of listeners because I had a lot of call-ins, but it turns out it was just one crazy guy doing different voices.
 <br>
 You may know him as fez.
 <br>
 Fez, just tell me your secret.
 <br>
 Just kiss me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not doing that.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;m not telling you my secret.
 <br>
 - Just tell me.
 <br>
 - Just kiss me.
 <br>
 Big news from the salon-- I just shampooed Marie, who waits tables at the coffee shop.
 <br>
 Well, that is big news.
 <br>
 She served pie at and Hyde&#39;s sister Angie, and Kelso took the pie and fed it to Angie, and she liked it.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Oh, this isn&#39;t good.
 <br>
 Steven is gonna lose his mind.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Angie went out with Kelso.
 <br>
 What? Angie went out with Kelso? What? Don&#39;t you what me.
 <br>
 You know what you did.
 <br>
 It was $10.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll put it back in the register.
 <br>
 No, Not that.
 <br>
 You went out with Kelso.
 <br>
 Look, in my town, there are two rules.
 <br>
 One--don&#39;t date kelso.
 <br>
 Two--don&#39;t date kelso.
 <br>
 Yeah, it even says that on the sign when you drive into town.
 <br>
 &#34;Welcome to point place Don&#39;t date kelso.
 <br>
 &#34; The high school band spells that out during halftime.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m not dating michael.
 <br>
 We went out one time, but it&#39;s not gonna happen again.
 <br>
 I need a guy who can eat a breadstick without pretending it&#39;s a cigar first.
 <br>
 Okay, the thing is, Angie, Michael&#39;s like chocolate cake, Okay? It looks good in the bakery, but when you take it home, it sleeps with all your friends.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, what kind of food am I? Um I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I guess a Twizzler.
 <br>
 What? No, it&#39;s a good thing.
 <br>
 You can have a lot of them and not even notice.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna sit there and take that? Of course you are.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a Twizzler.
 <br>
 Are you closed yet or what? I&#39;ve been waiting in the parking lot forever.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t see you out there.
 <br>
 That&#39;s because I was hiding in the bushes by your car.
 <br>
 I figuRed when I jumped out, you&#39;d be so relieved it was me that you&#39;d go out with me again.
 <br>
 Why didn&#39;t you just ask me out? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I was ye I was gonna, but you&#39;re so pretty and successful and plus I kind of like hiding in the bushes.
 <br>
 Michael, I appreciate the offer, but I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re my type.
 <br>
 Not your type? I&#39;m like ketchup.
 <br>
 I go good on everything.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, thanks, anyways.
 <br>
 Okay, all right, look, Angie, I really wanna go out with you again, Okay? And I got about 50 lines that I could throw at you right now, but.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna do that because I don&#39;t want you to go out with me because of some line.
 <br>
 I want you to go out with me &#39;cause you like me as much as I like you.
 <br>
 Are you telling me that&#39;s not a line? Well, it&#39;s not now, but if it works, I can add it to the list.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? Let&#39;s go get a drink, but just one drink.
 <br>
 Ready  for that drink now? That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 10 &#34;Surprise, Surprise&#34; you know, I&#39;m not sure these sex pistols are for me.
 <br>
 Look, this fella&#39;s name is Johnny Rotten.
 <br>
 You&#39;d think he&#39;d change that for show business.
 <br>
 Oh, Mrs.
 <br>
 Foreman, okay, Steven just found out Michael went out with his sister, So I need to think of something to do to cheer him up.
 <br>
 Well, I do know Steven loves peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.
 <br>
 So I go buy those? No, Jackie, you make them.
 <br>
 So I hire someone to make them? No.
 <br>
 You have to make them with your own two hands.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll pay you $20 to make them.
 <br>
 Only you can put in the love that is the real secret ingRedient.
 <br>
 $30.
 <br>
 Will you two hens stop clucking? Donna&#39;s back on the radio.
 <br>
 Okay, that was the thursday rock block, and you&#39;re listening to the new and improved Hot Donna, now with hair like like strands of gold.
 <br>
 And if you&#39;re driving home and things are a little loud, stop by the Forman and son muffler shop, where they&#39;re also giving away calendars.
 <br>
 She said Forman on the radio.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna have to change our phone number.
 <br>
 You know, that Donna is a great girl.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe that Eric wouldn&#39;t marry her.
 <br>
 When I get back home, I&#39;m gonna kick him in the ass.
 <br>
 And now &#34;love you inside out&#34; by the Bee Gees going out to Jackie Burkhart from Steven Hyde Oh, see now? Steven loves me and wants everyone to know it.
 <br>
 Requested by jackie burkhart.
 <br>
 Okay, Fez, I&#39;ll play you one more game, but just so you know, this honk-honk is a foul.
 <br>
 - Hey, guys.
 <br>
 - Hey, Angie.
 <br>
 I need to talk to you guys about something.
 <br>
 Oh, god, you didn&#39;t go out with Kelso again, did you? No.
 <br>
 I was on my way to going out with him, but then we got interrupted by me sleeping with him.
 <br>
 What? Well, at least they didn&#39;t go out.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 I need some advice.
 <br>
 My advice is go back in time and don&#39;t sleep with Kelso.
 <br>
 Yeah, but you need a time machine.
 <br>
 The only person working on that is kelso.
 <br>
 you have to sleep with him, so you&#39;re kind of back where you started.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s the thing.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if you guys have noticed, but I&#39;m kind of, - you know - bitchy? I was gonna say uptight, but fine.
 <br>
 I never relax and laugh, and with Michael, that&#39;s all we do, except for the sex, although I did laugh, you know, during.
 <br>
 Actually, it was more of a giggle of appreciation.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m not sure you know what you&#39;re getting yourself into-- Kelso has a baby with another woman.
 <br>
 Yeah, he told me.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 I thought that would run you off for sure.
 <br>
 Let me try.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the master of running girls off.
 <br>
 You think he&#39;s good in bed, huh? How do you think he got that good? Practice, practice, practice cheerleader, cheerleader cheerleaders, mother.
 <br>
 Hey, fez, check out this nudie calendar.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Is this the calendar Red&#39;s giving away? It&#39;s just pictures of half-naked girls posing by cars.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a disgrace.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll dispose of that.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;ll take it.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll never get it back now.
 <br>
 It&#39;s going in the box with my naked lady pen and my &#34;I got crabs in louisiana&#34; t-shirt.
 <br>
 Thank you for helping me, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Steven is gonna love these cookies.
 <br>
 Okay, now start by cracking a couple of eggs into the bowl.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t touch an egg.
 <br>
 Why not? &#39;Cause it came out of a chicken butt.
 <br>
 Honey,  they wash it.
 <br>
 Well, wash it all you want, it still came out of a butt.
 <br>
 All right, so I&#39;ve been thinking about Donna&#39;s Twizzler remark.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;s not so bad.
 <br>
 I mean, yes, it is candy, but, you know,you bite both ends off, you got a straw.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a metaphor for versatility.
 <br>
 No, I think it&#39;s a metaphor for you being long, skinny, bendy and floppy.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 Why are you smiling? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Talk to Angie today? No.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah! I have officially nailed everyone in this room&#39;s sister.
 <br>
 Ow! That&#39;s Ow Hey, Hyde, Kelso and Angie-- oh, you already know.
 <br>
 Hyde, Allow me to be the first to welcome you to the &#34;Kelso had sex with my sister&#34; club.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no handshake or password.
 <br>
 There&#39;s really just shame.
 <br>
 Damn it, Kelso.
 <br>
 My sister&#39;s been in town for a month.
 <br>
 You&#39;re already slept with her? This is why I keep my sister in a jungle.
 <br>
 Believe me, if things don&#39;t work out with Angie, I&#39;m on the next flight out.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde, remember how you kept bringing it up when Kelso nailed my sister? I never understood why, but now I get it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun.
 <br>
 So guess what? Kelso nailed your sister.
 <br>
 Oh, and another thing, Kelso nailed your sister.
 <br>
 Shut up, you little Twizzler.
 <br>
 Stick and stones may break my bones, but Kelso nailed your sister.
 <br>
 Okay, I know you can do this.
 <br>
 An egg is not just something that comes out of a butt.
 <br>
 It&#39;s it&#39;s a life source, it&#39;s beautiful, so pick it up.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you do it? You&#39;re a nurse.
 <br>
 You mess around with butts all the time.
 <br>
 Just pick up the friggin&#39; egg, you spoiled brat! Shh.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s back on the radio.
 <br>
 Maybe she&#39;ll mention my shop again.
 <br>
 Okay, now it&#39;s time for a new segment on my show &#34;what&#39;s on your mind, Hot Donna?&#34; When I agreed to promote the Forman and Son calendar, I had no idea it was just pages of half-naked women straddling drive shafts, Which is wrong, wrong, because cars get very hot.
 <br>
 So if they were to do these things, they would easily burn their thighs.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right, Forman and son mufflers is promoting the burning of women.
 <br>
 What is she talking about? Now I would call for a boycott, but girls never go down to these places.
 <br>
 So I call for a going-down-there-and-yelling-at-them cott.
 <br>
 Oh, great.
 <br>
 Not I&#39;ve gotta go back down to the shop before those hairy-ass feminists tear the place down.
 <br>
 Okay,now I would like to hear from some pissed off feminists.
 <br>
 You&#39;re on the air with Hot Donna, or should I say &#34;hot under the collar&#34; Donna? Donna Pinciotti, you should be ashamed of yourself.
 <br>
 Suddenly you think women shouldn&#39;t be looked at? Well, I&#39;ve seen your outfits, miss lady tank top.
 <br>
 Um, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, this isn&#39;t about me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about society.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s about Red, who&#39;s been like a second father to you, and now finally he has something to be proud of, and you&#39;re forcing your weirdo hippie politics on it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a couple of greased-up broads on a chevy.
 <br>
 Get over it.
 <br>
 Steven, I can&#39;t believe you thought I&#39;d like these Sex Pistols.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want anything this loud and crabby in my house if I&#39;m not married to it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll make it up to you.
 <br>
 Have you ever heard of a band called Judas Priest? Well, that&#39;s what judas needed, a priest.
 <br>
 Are they spiritual? I listen to them every sunday.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, Fez, you&#39;re the candy expert in these parts.
 <br>
 Okay, do you think I&#39;m a Twizzler? Well, you&#39;re no hershey&#39;s special dark like your friend Fez.
 <br>
 Okay, well, then how do I untwizzle myself? Well,you need to become richer, more chocolate.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, just show Donna who&#39;s boss.
 <br>
 Take her like a man.
 <br>
 No, I tried that once in bed, but all I got was a sprained wrist.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 Y.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 --Advice in &#34;playboy&#34; not always practical if you can&#39;t overpower your woman.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Hyde, how&#39;s it going with the store and Kelso nailing your sister? Steven, stop turning the Pat Boone albums into Pat Boner albums.
 <br>
 Okay,  you need to stop sleeping with kelso, okay? It&#39;s embarrassing, and if you catch something, we don&#39;t have medical.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not embarrassing.
 <br>
 He really likes me and I really like him.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t even know him.
 <br>
 You do realize he has a really bad track record with women, right? Look, I just don&#39;t wanna see you get hurt.
 <br>
 Oh, my god, that&#39;s so sweet.
 <br>
 I finally feel like I have a brother.
 <br>
 Oh, Hyde has a sister who got nailed by Kelso.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman really yelled at me, and I feel bad about what I said on the radio and I&#39;d like to apologize.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry about it.
 <br>
 People have been coming in nonstop since you talked about the calendar.
 <br>
 I cannot believe all the disgusting perverts in this town who listen to my show.
 <br>
 Hey, pervs, I&#39;m Hot Donna.
 <br>
 Dad? You&#39;re with the pervs? I&#39;m just here to support Red.
 <br>
 I see that calendar.
 <br>
 Put it down.
 <br>
 No, I won&#39;t put it down.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the kid and I&#39;m the dad, and I will have my fantasy ladies.
 <br>
 Fine, dad, but you won&#39;t have my respect.
 <br>
 One more woman who doesn&#39;t respect me-- that camel&#39;s back broke long ago.
 <br>
 Okay, this is Hot Donna back I&#39;m a Twizzler?! I&#39;m a Twizzler?! Unh-unh, I&#39;m a man.
 <br>
 Now you put on &#34;free bird&#34; &#39;cause we&#39;re gonna do it for 13 minutes.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric, what do you do when you have two pieces of wood and want them to stick together? Oh, you nail it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s easy.
 <br>
 It&#39;s kind of like how Kelso nailed Hyde&#39;s sister.
 <br>
 But I know if I can find a piece of wood that&#39;s as slutty as Hyde&#39;s sister.
 <br>
 You guys have been working on this a while? About as long as Kelso&#39;s been working on your sister.
 <br>
 Stop it, stop it.
 <br>
 Everybody, stop it.
 <br>
 Steven, don&#39;t listen to them.
 <br>
 Okay, I knew you were having a hard time, so I baked you these cookies.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Ow.
 <br>
 Are they no good? No, no, they&#39;re good.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just suck on them.
 <br>
 Mmm oh, forget it.
 <br>
 I ruined them.
 <br>
 They didn&#39;t make you feel better at all.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Jackie, you know who did feel better? Hyde&#39;s sister after kelso nailed her.
 <br>
 Give me those.
 <br>
 Ow Ow! Hey, Angie! After you close up, do you wanna watch me eat a pizza? Look, Michael, I&#39;m not sure we should see each other again.
 <br>
 A lot of people have told me you&#39;re not very serious about the women you date, a lot of people a lot, a lot everybody.
 <br>
 Okay, here&#39;s the thing about those stories they&#39;re all true.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes in my past, okay? And I could tell you that I&#39;ve changed, but I would rather just show you.
 <br>
 So why don&#39;t we start off slow as friends? My other friends do not let me do that.
 <br>
 Just do me one favor.
 <br>
 Anything.
 <br>
 Just don&#39;t tell Hyde.
 <br>
 Oh, I gotta tell Hyde.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ve got my candles, I&#39;ve got my bubbles and I&#39;ve got my soothing, spiritual Judas Priest music.
 <br>
