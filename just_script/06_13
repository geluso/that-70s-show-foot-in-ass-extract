 So Fez thought he was on a date with Suzy, and he shot a rabbit to impress her.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t he know he could have just bought her flowers? Oh, I would die if you got me flowers.
 <br>
 You&#39;d be lucky to get a dead rabbit.
 <br>
 Suzy, why would Fez think you&#39;d like a dead rabbit? Are you from the south or something? No.
 <br>
 I think he did it because he knows that as a cop, I like to spill blood.
 <br>
 But I want to hurt people, not animals.
 <br>
 You know what? This is my fault.
 <br>
 I never should have told Fez you liked him when you liked me.
 <br>
 If only there was something I could do to make him feel better.
 <br>
 I have an idea.
 <br>
 Oh, good.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s gonna make it worse now.
 <br>
 No, look.
 <br>
 Just let Fez take you to dinner, and then for dessert, do it with him.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Okay, if you do me this favor, I&#39;ll buy you a new gun.
 <br>
 That would make her a hooker.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Hookers do it for money.
 <br>
 This would be for a gun.
 <br>
 Hey, I have standards.
 <br>
 I mean, if it&#39;s sleeping with a suspect to extract some information, fine, or posing as a prostitute for a quickie in the back of a car to snare some John, sure.
 <br>
 But jeez, Michael, what kind of girl do you think I am? Hello, Suzy.
 <br>
 I&#39;d love to stand here and stare at you until you get uncomfortable But I have a relationship to end.
 <br>
 Kelso, here&#39;s everything you ever gave me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want it anymore.
 <br>
 Look, Fez, you don&#39;t have to do this.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Fez, when you split up with someone, you don&#39;t have to give stuff back.
 <br>
 You wait until they leave the house, take everything they care about and break the rest.
 <br>
 That way, they have nothing.
 <br>
 Lucky for me I already have nothing.
 <br>
 Oh, you can have less.
 <br>
 The point is that I don&#39;t want anything you gave me.
 <br>
 I never gave you my yo-yo.
 <br>
 So I took it, and I tangled the string, too.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see you walk the dog now, you son of a bitch.
 <br>
 Are those new birth-control pills? Let the doing it commence.
 <br>
 Do you have to do that every time? Donna, if I had the money, I&#39;d take out an ad in the paper.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 Never say, &#34;oh, no&#34; when you&#39;re talking about birth-control pills.
 <br>
 Anything&#39;s better than &#34;oh, no.
 <br>
 &#34; I forgot to take one.
 <br>
 Except that.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 One minute my life&#39;s all light and breezy, and the next, I&#39;m shackled to you and some kid.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, my heart is pounding so hard Like in the cartoons, when Daisy duck sees Donald duck, and her heart goes, &#34;ba-bo! Ba-boom!&#34; But that was a happy thing, and this is &#39;cause you couldn&#39;t keep your dirty hands off me! Okay, come on, let&#39;s think.
 <br>
 Hey, there&#39;s only a couple times a month something like this can happen, right? Maybe there&#39;s some kind of time-related loophole.
 <br>
 Hey, did we spring forward or fall back? When we did it? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what you&#39;d call it, but it&#39;s the same every time.
 <br>
 Well, I can&#39;t be that bad, Donna.
 <br>
 I got you pregnant! Hello, Wisconsin! Eric, I can&#39;t believe you knocked up a girl, too.
 <br>
 I mean, you lose points for not doing it in a public place, but hey, gimme five.
 <br>
 Kelso, I don&#39;t really think this is a gimme five moment, okay? I am really freaked out.
 <br>
 Well, right now I&#39;m not so much freaked out as starving.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fascinated by your nose.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 You&#39;d be amazed at what I could fit up in there.
 <br>
 But the important thing is that you have responsibilities now, so you gotta step up like I did.
 <br>
 Look, if you mean you stepped up on a urinal to climb out of a window to get away from the girl you got pregnant, then yeah, you stepped up.
 <br>
 Still no Fez, huh? Wow, kelso, you really must have pissed him off.
 <br>
 He hasn&#39;t stayed away this long since he discovered bubble baths.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Fez still isn&#39;t talking to me, but I think he&#39;s calling, &#39;cause every once in awhile, I pick up the phone, and all I hear is breathing and the crinkle of a candy being unwrapped.
 <br>
 Man, we are sitting in the circle talking about relationships.
 <br>
 What happened to us? This stash must be from California.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Any news? Come on, that time of the month! No.
 <br>
 Nothing yet.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna throw up.
 <br>
 I told you we should have gone to Denny&#39;s.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, Donna, let&#39;s not talk about throwing up in front of the customers.
 <br>
 Ma&#39;am, here&#39;s your creamed corn.
 <br>
 I got no interest in getting a lady pregnant.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I&#39;m celibate.
 <br>
 I thought it was because no one would do it with you.
 <br>
 Hey, that&#39;s, like, a secondary reason.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, we&#39;re gonna figure this out, okay? Hey, you know what? We can ask my mom.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a nurse.
 <br>
 She loves this stuff.
 <br>
 At least once a week, she gives a talk about her uterus.
 <br>
 Eric, I don&#39;t want your mom to know.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s right.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no reason to let too many people know just yet.
 <br>
 Who have you told so far? Well, just my friends and this nice couple.
 <br>
 Okay, look, so I&#39;ll just tell you what my mom says, okay? Okay.
 <br>
 Just make sure she doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re talking about us.
 <br>
 Tell her you have a friend, a Canadian friend, who lives in an igloo, so she can&#39;t call her.
 <br>
 Donna, I think I know how to be subtle.
 <br>
 Mommy, mommy! Donna might be pregnant! Did she trap you? We&#39;ll move you away.
 <br>
 We won&#39;t play her game.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s nothing like that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just I had to tell someone.
 <br>
 Hey, promise me you won&#39;t say anything to dad.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I promise.
 <br>
 Oh, this is all my fault.
 <br>
 I should never have been intimate with your father while you were in the crib next to the bed.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t think he wants to make up.
 <br>
 Well, try anyway.
 <br>
 I got your back Your strong, muscular back.
 <br>
 Uh, Fez, look, I got you some candy and a &#34;Playboy&#34; and a six-pack.
 <br>
 So you can use &#39;em in whatever order you want.
 <br>
 Tell him what they&#39;re for.
 <br>
 In a tense standoff, you need to make the perp think you&#39;re on his side, even if you&#39;re about to put a bullet in his head.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Uh They&#39;re a peace offering.
 <br>
 Well, look at the American trying to buy his way out of trouble.
 <br>
 Fez, give Michael a chance.
 <br>
 You know what? No, Simpson, forget it.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re the one that blew it with Suzy, okay? I don&#39;t know you were going to shoot a defenseless rabbit.
 <br>
 Well, if you didn&#39;t know that, then you never knew me at all! Whatever! You know what, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re mad at me, &#39;cause now I&#39;m mad at you! Fine! Well, you could keep your stupid gifts, because now I don&#39;t want them! If you must know, it will be this then this.
 <br>
 So you knocked up the neighbour girl.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You should&#39;ve been thinking a little more about God before you got into this mess.
 <br>
 He would&#39;ve stopped you at first base.
 <br>
 Mom, you promised you wouldn&#39;t say anything.
 <br>
 And I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 I wrote it down.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re pregnant.
 <br>
 Okay, well, um, okay.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll move the wedding to next month, and then nine months later, we&#39;ll tell people the baby came early because you smoked.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to move the wedding up.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t we get a say in this? Red, say something.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Donna, he&#39;s not gonna help us.
 <br>
 Right now he&#39;s trying to figure out how to get both of his feet in both of our asses without leaving his chair.
 <br>
 Stop being weird.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll just have to make the best of this.
 <br>
 Besides, with Donna for a mother, there&#39;s a decent chance the kid&#39;ll be good at sports.
 <br>
 Well, Donna, I think you&#39;re too young to be a mother, so here&#39;s what we do Tell the kid you&#39;re his sister, midge and I are the parents, and when he turns 18, tell him we lied.
 <br>
 Probably get a good chuckle out of the whole thing.
 <br>
 Eric, a little help? Okay.
 <br>
 You guys Okay.
 <br>
 Whether we&#39;re pregnant or not, we can run our own lives, okay? Yeah.
 <br>
 And you know what? It would have been great if Donna could have had a career, but things change.
 <br>
 So, you know, fine, so you&#39;ll stay home with the baby.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 What? So I don&#39;t get a career? Well, you know You could sell tupperware or something.
 <br>
 Okay, you can just get bent.
 <br>
 What? Oh, come on.
 <br>
 What did I say? That wasn&#39;t so bad, was it? No.
 <br>
 I would love a tupperware lady in the family.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Jackie, have you seen Donna? Is she okay? Well, she wanted me to tell you a secret.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Ow! Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Ooh, what stinks out here? It must be this big, girl-stealing turd.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Oh, I will slap you silly.
 <br>
 Oh, stop! Hey, look, Jackie&#39;s right, all right? If you guys want to fight, let&#39;s go inside where there&#39;s more stuff to hit your head on.
 <br>
 Come on, you guys, lots of couples fight, but there&#39;s an easy way to fix this.
 <br>
 Just decide which one of you is the woman, and the other one just apologize.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to make up with kelso.
 <br>
 I want to make fun of kelso.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, what&#39;s up with kelso? Stupid.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, what&#39;s up with Fez? Foreign.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, this I s getting pretty lame.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s split into two groups.
 <br>
 Good idea boys and girls.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go, Jackie.
 <br>
 What? How you doing, kitten? Fine.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m scared.
 <br>
 Just know that whether you&#39;re pregnant or not, you&#39;re still my little girl.
 <br>
 I support you.
 <br>
 Thanks, dad.
 <br>
 But if you are pregnant, don&#39;t let red touch the baby.
 <br>
 He thinks he&#39;s tickling, but he just pokes.
 <br>
 Trust me, I know from experience.
 <br>
 Well, dad, maybe red wasn&#39;t trying to tickle you.
 <br>
 Maybe he was trying to poke you.
 <br>
 Why would red poke me? Why would he tickle you? Fez, since you&#39;re mad at Michael, shouldn&#39;t you be cutting his head out of those pictures instead of your head? Oh, I can&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 Have you seen how well he photographs? Fez, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re gonna let it end this way.
 <br>
 I always thought you and Michael would make it.
 <br>
 Well, we look good in public, but you weren&#39;t there for the bad times Like he never noticed when I got a new outfit.
 <br>
 Fez, just do what I did to get over Michael.
 <br>
 Make out with Hyde? No.
 <br>
 Just stop thinking about him.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Even the hub reminds me of him.
 <br>
 I remember this one day.
 <br>
 It was the only day the hub ever had tater tots And there was this really big tater tot, and I&#39;ll never forget what kelso said.
 <br>
 He said That&#39;s not a tater tot.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a tater giant.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, how we laughed.
 <br>
 Oh, Fez, Michael took me for granted, too.
 <br>
 But I found someone better, and so will you.
 <br>
 Yeah, don&#39;t end it all now.
 <br>
 You have so much to live for.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what we say when &#39;re trying to talk down a jumper.
 <br>
 I guess it doesn&#39;t really apply here.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m glad Fez is out of my life.
 <br>
 Always with the mood swings, and I&#39;d ask what&#39;s wrong, and all I&#39;d hear was, &#34;nothing.
 <br>
 &#34; And then the minute I want to watch a game, suddenly it&#39;s time to talk about our feelings.
 <br>
 Women.
 <br>
 Actually, we&#39;re talking about a man.
 <br>
 Boy, you guys are progressive.
 <br>
 The thing is, I know I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, but where am I gonna find another friend like Fez? Look, man, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, okay? It&#39;s like when you and Jackie broke up.
 <br>
 It was for the best, and after awhile, she found someone better me.
 <br>
 And since then, I&#39;ve enjoyed throwing that in your face as often as possible.
 <br>
 What was your question again? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Great news Donna&#39;s not pregnant.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not talking to me, and she kind of hung up on me, but that click and dead silence was the most beautiful sound I ever heard.
 <br>
 Well, what a relief, but you and I are still having a good, long talk about the uterus.
 <br>
 Man, dodged a bullet there, huh? Almost had a little dumb-ass running around here, huh? I&#39;m gonna go throw up now.
 <br>
 You know, you have been awfully calm about this whole thing.
 <br>
 You haven&#39;t threatened to put a foot in anyone&#39;s rear all day.
 <br>
 Well, I I guess I was kind of looking forward to having a grandkid.
 <br>
 I mean, since my heart attack, I&#39;ve realized at life is short, and it would be nice to know my grandkids before I go.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s so sweet.
 <br>
 Well, you know, if you&#39;re really disappointed, we could always ask Laurie.
 <br>
 She might have a few kids we don&#39;t know about.
 <br>
 Simpson, I&#39;m here.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s the cat on the trampoline? Sorry, Michael.
 <br>
 There is no cat.
 <br>
 Is there at least a trampoline? Please have a seat.
 <br>
 Tater tots.
 <br>
 You know, the last time the hub had tater tots was when Suzy, I got your message.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s the bouncing kitty? What&#39;s he doing here? Okay, I&#39;ve called you here because it&#39;s time you two talked things over, and I&#39;ve used tater tots to recreate one of your happiest times together.
 <br>
 Oh, look! There&#39;s a really big one.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not a tater tot.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a tater giant.
 <br>
 I look at your jumbo tot, and I feel nothing.
 <br>
 I, too, resist your tot.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Michael, Fez is a great guy.
 <br>
 He&#39;s he&#39;s loyal and sweet and innocent.
 <br>
 And, Fez, Michael&#39;s great, too.
 <br>
 He&#39;s pure and strong and More man than I&#39;ve ever seen in one pair of pants.
 <br>
 Hey, he&#39;s not so pure.
 <br>
 He&#39;s expecting a baby with another woman.
 <br>
 What?! Well, he&#39;s not so innocent.
 <br>
 He&#39;s married.
 <br>
 What? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re both disgusting! I don&#39;t want either one of you, and you really missed out, because I spent a semester in France, and I do stuff American girls think is gross.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 What was that about? Yeah.
 <br>
 She&#39;s flipping out &#39;cause someone she likes is married or having an illegitimate child.
 <br>
 What&#39;s she gonna do when there&#39;s real trouble? Yeah, we&#39;re better off without her.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 &#34;We&#34;? Ah, I guess I&#39;ve missed you.
 <br>
 Really? Man, &#39;cause I missed you, too, and, well, I wasn&#39;t trying to steal her.
 <br>
 I wanted her to be with you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;d rather have my friend back anyway.
 <br>
 Do you wanna I do if you do.
 <br>
 I do.
 <br>
 We are so lucky.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s obvious we&#39;re not ready to be parents.
 <br>
 What would we do? Hey, anything you want.
 <br>
 And by the way, when I said you could sell tupperware, that was just, like, code for you could be president of the United States.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t believe you, but I&#39;m too relieved to be mad.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll probably bring it up when we&#39;re having a fight about something else.
 <br>
 Listen, Donna, all I know is, we can never make this mistake again.
 <br>
 Yeah, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I think we learned our lesson.
 <br>
 Hurry up, Donna.
 <br>
 You&#39;re, uh, you&#39;re cutting into your foreplay time.
 <br>
 One second.
 <br>
 Oh, no! What?! What?! Just kidding.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not funny, Donna.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even do it now.
 <br>
 Yes, I can.
 <br>
 What would a French girl do that an American girl would think is gross? It could be anything.
 <br>
 They eat snails.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;s foot stuff.
 <br>
 Foot stuff? What would you do to a foot? I don&#39;t know, like Lick it or something.
 <br>
 What is wrong with you? What are you, some kind of foot licker? No.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t lick.
 <br>
 I would get licked.
 <br>
 Oh God! Why did I say that?
 <br>
