<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Yeah, that&#39;s a good sound.
 <br>
 Now, coming up in the second half-hour of American Bandstand: Shields and Yarnell, Elton John and Kiki Dee and now, The Spotlight Dance.
 <br>
 This is Mr.
 <br>
 Lou Rawls.
 <br>
 Jackie! Door! Knock! Sorry.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d be doing anything so embarrassing.
 <br>
 - Is Donna here? - No.
 <br>
 Look, I need to talk to someone.
 <br>
 I can really use a friend right now.
 <br>
 Okay, then.
 <br>
 Good luck with that.
 <br>
 Eric, can I talk to you? Look, I&#39;ve always been able to trust you and you&#39;re such a nice guy.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 Yes, you are.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 What happened? Did Kelso forget your birthday or something? I&#39;m pregnant.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re like a million miles away.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on? I have to tell you something, but you have to promise you won&#39;t tell anybody else.
 <br>
 Dirt! I swear.
 <br>
 Now tell me.
 <br>
 Not here.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Of course I support the Wolverines.
 <br>
 I have to.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a cheerleader, not a cheer-liar.
 <br>
 And then, in the dream, two of The Three Stooges fed me grapes while I played them a beautiful song on my accordion In the nude.
 <br>
 Somehow the accordion part bothers me more than the nude part.
 <br>
 - Michael, stop it! - What&#39;d I do? Look, I just need all the food I can get right now.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I have to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 Jackie? My God.
 <br>
 Donna, you have never asked me to go to the bathroom with you before.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s a big day.
 <br>
 Man, she has been acting so weird lately.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, guys, I think it&#39;s time I break up with her.
 <br>
 That&#39;s real nice.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you grow up? So, is it true? Yes, Donna, it is true.
 <br>
 I am carrying Michael Kelso&#39;s child.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re a sophomore.
 <br>
 How can you be so stupid? I&#39;m a sophomore.
 <br>
 Why didn&#39;t you, like, you know, use something? Look, I would have but my cousin Carla told me that I could not get pregnant for eight days after my period.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Eight days after your first day or your last day? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Carla never called me back.
 <br>
 My God, Donna, having this child is gonna ruin my whole life.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll have to wear flats, I&#39;ll gain weight, I&#39;ll be too fat to cheer.
 <br>
 Not to mention the fact you&#39;ll have a baby to take care of.
 <br>
 Donna, what am I gonna do? I&#39;m in such trouble.
 <br>
 Jackie, it&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll get through this.
 <br>
 What does Kelso say about all this? No! I cannot tell Michael.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s way too embarrassing.
 <br>
 - Jackie! - You had sex with him.
 <br>
 - I know I did.
 <br>
 But we didn&#39;t talk.
 <br>
 You have to tell Kelso.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t, I will.
 <br>
 Thank you, Donna.
 <br>
 Jackie, I don&#39;t want to tell him.
 <br>
 I think he knows.
 <br>
 - What? - Nothing.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just a little surprised that you&#39;re home, that&#39;s all.
 <br>
 It&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 You know, I just didn&#39;t feel like going away for spring break.
 <br>
 Honey, is there a warrant out for you in Fort Lauderdale? Now, Kitty, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s just home to spend time with us and Eric.
 <br>
 Why are you home? Daddy, it was just a very, very tough quarter.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll come through with flying colors.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, the whole concept of grades is so subjective.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really the experience of college that&#39;s important.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 Mail&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Nothing.
 <br>
 Sorry I was late.
 <br>
 We were at The Hub.
 <br>
 Then I had to drive everyone home, then Kelso says Blah, blah.
 <br>
 You&#39;re late.
 <br>
 Be responsible for your own actions.
 <br>
 That&#39;s real easy for you to say, pal! That kid&#39;s on dope.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t want to miss Sanford and Son.
 <br>
 Mom? - Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 A friend of mine, and it&#39;s not me is pregnant.
 <br>
 Is it you? - No, Mom, not me.
 <br>
 - Thank God.
 <br>
 I just had the most horrible flashback to when I was 16 and You were saying, honey? The whole pregnancy thing is just so scary and overwhelming.
 <br>
 Jackie, I mean my friend.
 <br>
 It is you, isn&#39;t it? No.
 <br>
 She had one night of fun and now her whole life is out of control.
 <br>
 Are you worried about you and Eric? No.
 <br>
 Maybe.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Honey, let me just tell you what I think.
 <br>
 Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, things happen.
 <br>
 And the backseat of a car is no place to be worrying about birth control.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 Sanford thinks he&#39;s having a heart attack.
 <br>
 It looks like the big one.
 <br>
 Come watch.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;ve been thinking about it and I&#39;m gonna do the right thing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be responsible.
 <br>
 I mean, I have to.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to be a father.
 <br>
 Yeah, and on the plus side you walk into a liquor store carrying a baby, man they&#39;ll sell you beer.
 <br>
 Yeah, and I like kids.
 <br>
 I still have some of my Legos.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be great.
 <br>
 And Jackie&#39;s mukatots will get huge.
 <br>
 Fez, for those of us who only speak English, what exactly is a &#34;mukatot&#34;? Feet.
 <br>
 They will get long as well as wide.
 <br>
 Very gratifying.
 <br>
 You foreign freak.
 <br>
 I mean, this is scary, man.
 <br>
 I might have to get married.
 <br>
 Not just married.
 <br>
 Married to Jackie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s freaking terrifying.
 <br>
 - Okay, I am never having sex again.
 <br>
 - Yeah, good one.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just not worth it.
 <br>
 Just wait, Eric.
 <br>
 This could so easily happen to you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 I&#39;d probably have to have sex first.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s just not fair.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re telling me.
 <br>
 I want to have sex.
 <br>
 Laurie, I sure have noticed you hanging around the mailbox a lot.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 What could be so important that you&#39;d give up a week of whoring around Fort Lauderdale? I know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your grades, right? You&#39;re flunking out.
 <br>
 Bingo! Forman scores! Right? Okay, Eric.
 <br>
 You know what? Dad likes me and he doesn&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 Can I help you? Sure.
 <br>
 Pictures for Forman.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 Hey, there, Eric.
 <br>
 You okay? I was just How are you? Here you go.
 <br>
 Can I help you? Yup.
 <br>
 Prescription for Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Trying on cologne for Donna? That is so darn cute.
 <br>
 Thank you, sir.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 That&#39;ll be $21.
 <br>
 50.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a little pricey for cough medicine.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, Donna.
 <br>
 Ortho-novum.
 <br>
 Ortho what? Ortho-novum.
 <br>
 Birth control pills.
 <br>
 Midge! Midge? Meet Bob.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a typical American who works hard loves his family and has never cheated on his tax return.
 <br>
 Life is good but lately, he&#39;s noticed some slight changes in his daughter Donna.
 <br>
 &#34;Hi, honey.
 <br>
 How was school today?&#34; &#34;Great, Dad.
 <br>
 &#34;I got an A on a test &#34;and tonight I&#39;m having cocktails with the principal.
 <br>
 &#34;Will you excuse us, Dad? &#34;We have to study.
 <br>
 &#34; Bob realizes his daughter is growing up.
 <br>
 Now that Donna&#39;s on the pill she&#39;s what medical professionals call: Open for business.
 <br>
 Come on, Bob.
 <br>
 I want to show you something.
 <br>
 You see, Bob, the pill means Donna can have lots of sex with many different partners.
 <br>
 Not just Eric.
 <br>
 &#34;Hi, Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 &#34;Boy, is your daughter something!&#34; So.
 <br>
 Do you get it, Bob? She&#39;s open for business.
 <br>
 Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m next.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re not eating.
 <br>
 Are you sick? Yeah, Eric, you seem upset.
 <br>
 Did something happen at the pharmacy? What happened at the pharmacy? Nothing.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Eric, be nice to your sister.
 <br>
 Kitty, what happened to the mail? I checked the mail, Dad.
 <br>
 Nothing.
 <br>
 No mail.
 <br>
 You know, the mail keeps disappearing.
 <br>
 I think we have a little mail thief.
 <br>
 Speaking of.
 <br>
 Laurie, I could&#39;ve sworn I saw a University of Wisconsin envelope sticking out of your bra.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that all about? What? Donna&#39;s on the pill.
 <br>
 What did you do? Nothing.
 <br>
 Dinner&#39;s over! You.
 <br>
 Kitchen.
 <br>
 Now.
 <br>
 I know you&#39;re 17 and we can&#39;t stop you from doing what you want to do.
 <br>
 - Yes, we can.
 <br>
 - Red! All I&#39;m saying is, have respect for her.
 <br>
 You respect her by keeping your hands off of her.
 <br>
 You are a dirty boy, Eric.
 <br>
 Okay, now, let&#39;s talk about birth control.
 <br>
 Birth control? Don&#39;t do it! That&#39;s your birth control.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna pray for you, Eric.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the devil.
 <br>
 And did you know that Laurie&#39;s flunking out of college? Don&#39;t change the subject.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve got strange thoughts in your little head and that Donna&#39;s a nice girl.
 <br>
 Red, you are giving him the wrong idea about sex.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s not dirty.
 <br>
 - But it&#39;s not clean, either.
 <br>
 Okay, cleanliness.
 <br>
 Now, that reminds me, always make sure your nails are trimmed and clean.
 <br>
 Foreplay is very important.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 It is.
 <br>
 Personally, I&#39;m very proud to have a daughter who acted so mature and responsible.
 <br>
 I&#39;m her father.
 <br>
 You should&#39;ve told me, Midge.
 <br>
 Can you imagine how I felt standing there with Eric when the pharmacist handed me birth control pills? Eric knows? Thanks a lot, Dad! - You know, she and Eric are dating.
 <br>
 - All the more reason.
 <br>
 You&#39;d rather she got pregnant? That is not gonna happen to Donna.
 <br>
 It happened to us.
 <br>
 Sure, throw that in my face again.
 <br>
 Hey, Laurie.
 <br>
 Is Eric around? No, he&#39;s at The Hub.
 <br>
 Watch the door.
 <br>
 - What are you doing? - My grades.
 <br>
 I gotta make some Fs into Bs before Red sees them.
 <br>
 You&#39;re fine.
 <br>
 Red and Kitty are watching Bonanza.
 <br>
 - I gotta go.
 <br>
 - Smart move going on the pill.
 <br>
 That was the best thing I ever did.
 <br>
 Just wait &#39;til you get to college.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Donna! Guess what? You&#39;re having twins? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not pregnant.
 <br>
 My God.
 <br>
 Jackie, thank God.
 <br>
 My God, I can forget about this whole ugly thing put it behind me, and never ever I am not gonna let you forget about this all right? You got really lucky.
 <br>
 And as your friend I&#39;m not gonna let you be stupid about this.
 <br>
 We&#39;re friends? Shut up.
 <br>
 Jackie, I went on the pill.
 <br>
 My God you are gonna be so popular! Jackie, I didn&#39;t do it to be popular.
 <br>
 I did it because I am not gonna get stuck in this dinky little town.
 <br>
 Okay, you know they&#39;re building a Kmart on Franklin.
 <br>
 Jackie, when this ERA passes, I&#39;m gonna be able to do whatever I want.
 <br>
 And so will you if you don&#39;t screw it up now.
 <br>
 So, Donna, tell me more about this pill.
 <br>
 Does it do anything weird to your hair? Only above your lip.
 <br>
 I still don&#39;t understand why Donna has to take this pill.
 <br>
 Is she sick? No, Fez.
 <br>
 She takes the pill so that she can have all the sex she wants and not get pregnant.
 <br>
 With such a useful product available what the hell were you thinking, you idiot? Forman, you know what you should do, man? You should probably break up with Donna.
 <br>
 Because the pressure of that much worryfree sex that could kill you.
 <br>
 Yeah, that would be Plan B, Hyde.
 <br>
 I wish Jackie would&#39;ve thought about going on the pill.
 <br>
 You know, if I had the chance, I&#39;d do it all different.
 <br>
 No, you wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re right, I wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 I should&#39;ve broken up with her when I had the chance.
 <br>
 So, Eric, can I talk to you? Alone.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Michael I&#39;m not pregnant.
 <br>
 Yes! Yes! - So, you feel tons better, right? - Oh, yeah! My God, that&#39;s so great.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you know what? I&#39;m breaking up with you.
 <br>
 What? Look, Michael, this whole experience has opened my eyes and nothing will stand in the way of my dream of becoming a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.
 <br>
 Did she just break up with me? Yup.
 <br>
 I am so sad for you.
 <br>
 May I please have her phone number? My God, Eric.
 <br>
 So your parents know I&#39;m on the pill, too? Yeah.
 <br>
 I had a nice conversation with Red and Kitty about foreplay.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Me, too.
 <br>
 Eric, I don&#39;t want you to think this changes anything between us.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 But it could right? I suppose.
 <br>
 I mean, who knows, it might even be you.
 <br>
 Might? All I&#39;m saying is, we have to wait for the right time.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 How about now? - No.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 How about now? - No.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Now? - Yes.
 <br>
 Really? No.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Now, right? I&#39;ll be waiting.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 I got a birthday coming up so It&#39;s for your own good, son.
 <br>
 Okay, who dealt? I bid three hearts.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go with three spades.
 <br>
 This is fun.
 <br>
