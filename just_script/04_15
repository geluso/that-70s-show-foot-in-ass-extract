<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 It is literally a million degrees out.
 <br>
 I&#39;m wearing shorts in January! Have you ever seen prettier legs on a fella? Michael, we&#39;ll admire your legs later.
 <br>
 Snow Prom is tomorrow.
 <br>
 We need to keep up our campaign for Snow Queen and Snow King.
 <br>
 Jackie, I did campaign.
 <br>
 I wrote our names all over the place.
 <br>
 Kelso, you peed in the snow.
 <br>
 In cursive! It was awesome.
 <br>
 Okay, look, you may not take this seriously, but I do.
 <br>
 I used to be a rich, popular girl.
 <br>
 But now that my dad has cut me off, I&#39;m not rich so I have to be twice as popular.
 <br>
 Okay, maybe you should spend less time worrying about being popular and more time being thoughtful, friendly, considerate.
 <br>
 Okay, can I get a translation because that was gibberish.
 <br>
 Come on, Michael.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what? We should all go to Snow Prom together, in one car all of us hanging out, laughing, driving.
 <br>
 Whoo-hoo! Good times.
 <br>
 You need a ride, don&#39;t you? I so do.
 <br>
 Pick me up at the radio station.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll all go together.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Hyde, you&#39;re going to a school dance? You&#39;re going to stink bomb the teachers&#39; lounge, aren&#39;t you? I want in! No, man, kid stuff.
 <br>
 See, during the dance, I&#39;m going to throw a party in Coach Ferguson&#39;s office.
 <br>
 I&#39;m bringing my best stuff.
 <br>
 A party with your best stuff? Are you saying what I think you&#39;re saying? - You know it.
 <br>
 - Oh, boy, you have a pinata? It&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 I feel like I&#39;m forgetting something.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got my watch, my wallet, my who-am-I-kidding condom.
 <br>
 Yeah, sounds like you got everything, except for a tall redhead.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 What man doesn&#39;t love a tall red- Oh, my God, Donna! I forgot Donna.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Mr.
 <br>
 Hyde? In school after hours? What, are you trying to establish an alibi? Coach Ferguson, shouldn&#39;t you be on the football field teaching boys to play with balls? Don&#39;t push my buttons, wiseacre.
 <br>
 And there he goes.
 <br>
 I think now is a good time to go fumigate his office.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I have exciting news for you two.
 <br>
 Michael, you have been elected Snow King.
 <br>
 Yeah! And,Jackie, you are the new Snow Queen runner-up! Oh, my God! This is the happiest day of my life! Wait, runner-up? How could that be? There&#39;s been a mistake! It was fixed! You poke me one more time, I&#39;m gonna paddle you.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be hot.
 <br>
 ( Whispering ) I-I have a serious announcement.
 <br>
 A tornado warning has been issued.
 <br>
 I&#39;m told it&#39;s code red.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know the codes, but red sounds serious.
 <br>
 Michael, this is my worst nightmare.
 <br>
 A tornado is your worst nightmare? Mine&#39;s monsters.
 <br>
 How could I be runner-up? If I&#39;m not a rich, popular girl, I&#39;m nothing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m like Donna.
 <br>
 No,Jackie, you are the girlfriend to the Snow King.
 <br>
 Now, as Snow King, I must lead my people to safety.
 <br>
 All right, everyone! Everyone, follow me! Remain calm, people! These are just sports balls! Everyone grab a ball! ( Car Stereo:Rock ) All right.
 <br>
 ( Wind Howling ) ( Turns Off) ( Resumes ) Now, I&#39;m just so worried about Eric.
 <br>
 A tornado in January? Yeah, life&#39;s full of surprises.
 <br>
 Like these two showing up &#39;cause they don&#39;t have a basement.
 <br>
 Surprise! Gee, Red, you seem grouchy.
 <br>
 Surprise! Red, if Eric gets caught in a tornado, he&#39;ll get blown to Canada.
 <br>
 He&#39;s very light.
 <br>
 Kitty, the gym is the town&#39;s bomb shelter.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 I just hope he&#39;s not crying.
 <br>
 Everybody knows he&#39;s my kid.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just talk about something else.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) Ooh! You know,Joanne taught me a lot about lady orgasms.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve been around longer than I thought.
 <br>
 Okay, so talking&#39;s bad.
 <br>
 I know, charades! - No, thanks.
 <br>
 - What are you, chicken? ( Chuckles ) Did you just call me chicken? That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Move the couch, Kitty.
 <br>
 She&#39;s going down.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Busted, hophead.
 <br>
 People of the make-out stairwell this is your Snow King speaking.
 <br>
 Boo! Hit the lights, fool! No, th-there&#39;s a tornado.
 <br>
 Everyone go to the gym.
 <br>
 The Snow King has spoken! All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s gross.
 <br>
 Who threw the retainer? Oh, my God, Fez! A tornado? This changes everything.
 <br>
 This could be our last night here on earth.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to die a virgin.
 <br>
 Not if I have anything to say about it.
 <br>
 You can talk all you want, but there&#39;s a tornado coming.
 <br>
 Fez, I mean, let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 It? &#39;&#39;It&#39;&#39; it? All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to need you.
 <br>
 - Eric, you&#39;re here! - Donna, look, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 I really did want to pick you up before the dance.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s no big deal, really.
 <br>
 No big deal? It&#39;s a huge deal.
 <br>
 I was in back filing records, and suddenly everyone was gone, and I was stuck here alone.
 <br>
 And you risked the tornado for me.
 <br>
 Tornado? What tornado could stop me from helping you? So, uh, tell me, um, is the tornado, like, um- like, out there? Yeah.
 <br>
 They say it&#39;s a biggie.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 - Eric, are you okay? Sure.
 <br>
 Uh, it&#39;s just that now that I know you&#39;re okay I can finally start worrying about me.
 <br>
 And, see, the thing about me is I don&#39;t want to die.
 <br>
 So, what to do? Let&#39;s see, there&#39;s you, there&#39;s me, candlelight.
 <br>
 You know, back in the old days we would have- - We&#39;re not doing that.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 So quick to dismiss the thing you once ached for.
 <br>
 You mean, cheese sticks? If you want to call it that, sure.
 <br>
 ( Stammering ) Gyrating.
 <br>
 Ehh, twisting.
 <br>
 Uh- Hips! You make me feel like hips! Uh, time! We win.
 <br>
 I was dancing! &#39;&#39;You make me feel like hips&#39;&#39;? It could have been a song.
 <br>
 Is it hard to lose, Red? &#39;Cause you make it look so easy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re in big trouble, bud.
 <br>
 You should suspend me.
 <br>
 I need a vacation.
 <br>
 A tornado&#39;s coming.
 <br>
 It&#39;s code red.
 <br>
 You know what that means.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s serious.
 <br>
 - ( Thunderclap ) - A tornado? Deadly spirals of wind really freak me out.
 <br>
 - All right, Coach Girlie.
 <br>
 Calm down.
 <br>
 - I can&#39;t die yet! There&#39;s so much I haven&#39;t experienced.
 <br>
 I bet I know one thing you haven&#39;t experienced.
 <br>
 Tornadoes get a bad rap, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like the Wizard of Oz.
 <br>
 I mean, where are the midgets? I bet I could bench, like, 1 0 midgets.
 <br>
 Hey, look at all the stuff you confiscated.
 <br>
 Mine.
 <br>
 Mine.
 <br>
 Ooh, la, la.
 <br>
 Mine now.
 <br>
 Why am I not Snow Queen? For the last two weeks, I was nice to everybody.
 <br>
 Well, maybe not the A.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Club, but I mean, come on.
 <br>
 Jackie, you can&#39;t just be nice for two weeks.
 <br>
 You have to be nice all the time.
 <br>
 Or very handsome.
 <br>
 Oh, my banana nose! Oh.
 <br>
 I thought this was gone forever.
 <br>
 Ha.
 <br>
 It&#39;s still funny! Maybe Donna was right.
 <br>
 Maybe being popular isn&#39;t as important as being nice to people.
 <br>
 I mean, I know that sounds wrong, but anything&#39;s possible.
 <br>
 Hey,Jackie, whatever makes you feel better about being a loser.
 <br>
 - ( Squirting ) - Hey, watch the banana nose! ( Chuckling ) Hey, Hyde, when this is all over, you think we&#39;ll still be friends? Well, my head says no, but my heart says no.
 <br>
 So, no.
 <br>
 I wonder what Donna and Forman are doing right now.
 <br>
 This is the best tornado ever! I know! And who better to be stuck here with than America&#39;s most beloved rock band ladies and gentlemen, Aerosmith! ( Eric ) Hey, as rock legends, we&#39;ve had some pretty good times.
 <br>
 But it doesn&#39;t get any better than this.
 <br>
 Hello, Wisconsin! Yeah, I dig this joint too.
 <br>
 Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 That was your Aerosmith? You&#39;re bad at that.
 <br>
 Steven Tyler is way cooler, and Joe Perry is so dreamy.
 <br>
 God, you&#39;re bad at that! What? That was dead-on! Right, guys? I bought it.
 <br>
 ( Whoops ) You, uh, really think I&#39;m dreamy? Whoa.
 <br>
 The station manager&#39;s stuff is way better than ours.
 <br>
 Well, I lived my dream.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t just leaveJackie here like that.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Okay, we&#39;re good.
 <br>
 Oh, Toto.
 <br>
 Losing Snow Queen has left me searching for guidance.
 <br>
 Surely, the Wizard of Oz can help.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Oh, well,Jackie, why&#39;d you make me the Scarecrow? He needs a brain.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, I made you the Scarecrow because you love chasing birds.
 <br>
 - I do love chasing birds.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Is this some kind of joke, &#39;cause I&#39;m not laughing.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s the Scarecrow? Yeah.
 <br>
 Look, guys! I&#39;m a bear.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re the Cowardly Lion.
 <br>
 But I want to be a bear.
 <br>
 - At least you got a brain.
 <br>
 - This sucks.
 <br>
 Oh, will everyone just shut up? When it&#39;s your dream, you can be whatever you want.
 <br>
 I want to be a bear.
 <br>
 Jackie, what the hell? ( Laughing ) She totally made you a witch.
 <br>
 That&#39;s so awesome! She made you a flying monkey.
 <br>
 What? Oh, crap! - Let&#39;s kick her ass! - Yeah.
 <br>
 ( Screams ) Miss Wizard, I&#39;m confused.
 <br>
 I lost Snow Queen.
 <br>
 And now I&#39;m wondering if titles and popularity aren&#39;t as important as being a good person.
 <br>
 Well, how do you know when you&#39;re a good person? - When everyone likes you, right? When you&#39;re popular.
 <br>
 - ( Gasps ) - And how do you know when you&#39;re popular? - Oh, my God! When you win titles like Snow Queen! Winning titles and being a good person are the same thing.
 <br>
 So you go after that title, child.
 <br>
 Oh, I will, Miss Wizard.
 <br>
 I will.
 <br>
 And remember, if someone calls you shallow, they&#39;re just jealous.
 <br>
 ( Echoes ) Justjealous.
 <br>
 Jealous.
 <br>
 Jealous.
 <br>
 Ah, our own private stairwell.
 <br>
 This is exactly how I pictured losing my virginity except it was on a bed of flowers and there were two of you.
 <br>
 Tornado passed through, is heading to Illinois.
 <br>
 Kiss my ass, Chicago! Oh, my God! We&#39;re-We&#39;re safe.
 <br>
 Sex just doesn&#39;t seem important anymore.
 <br>
 I- I disagree.
 <br>
 And-And here&#39;s why.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go celebrate with everyone.
 <br>
 ( Snorts ) Oh, you can make a tornado, but you can&#39;t let me do it? No, you are not a just God! Okay.
 <br>
 No six.
 <br>
 No six.
 <br>
 And - six! - ( Laughing ) - Look, Park Place.
 <br>
 - Ah, Park Place.
 <br>
 - Pay up.
 <br>
 - I told you we shouldn&#39;t spend all our money on Marvin Gardens.
 <br>
 Oh, and Baltic Avenue was such a help.
 <br>
 I bought that with my beauty-contest winnings.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 Poor Red, losing again.
 <br>
 While we have this large housing development that I like to callJoanne Land.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) Where&#39;s Red Land? - ( Mouthing Words ) - ( Laughing ) I&#39;ll tell you where it is.
 <br>
 It&#39;s right up your- - ( TV:News Theme ) - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Shh.
 <br>
 ( Man On TV) This just in.
 <br>
 The National Weather Service has canceled the tornado warning.
 <br>
 And updating our top story, a local teen is in critical condition- Oh, game over.
 <br>
 Call it a tie.
 <br>
 A tie? We had all the money.
 <br>
 So? We had the get-out-of-jail-free card.
 <br>
 And you can&#39;t put a price on freedom.
 <br>
 Night, night.
 <br>
 Look,Jackie, I know you&#39;re upset and I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re not Snow Queen.
 <br>
 But I do know this: I am Snow King.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s pretty cool.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;m not upset.
 <br>
 I just had the best dream.
 <br>
 And now I&#39;ve got to campaign for next year.
 <br>
 Guys, how&#39;s my hair? - ( Kelso ) Yeah, it&#39;s fantastic.
 <br>
 - ( Fez ) Wonderful.
 <br>
 Wonderful.
 <br>
 This was fun.
 <br>
 We haven&#39;t just hung out in, like, forever.
 <br>
 Plus, you&#39;re, like, my hero.
 <br>
 Most guys would not risk a tornado for an ex-girlfriend.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I just wanted to kiss you before you found out that I went to the dance, forgot you and I didn&#39;t know about the tornado.
 <br>
 Okay, this was swell.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 So, you forgot me? Okay, you&#39;re mad.
 <br>
 Actually, no.
 <br>
 I mean, if we were still dating, I&#39;d be super pissed.
 <br>
 But we&#39;re not, so it&#39;s kind of funny.
 <br>
 You know what? Let me buy you a burger.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you totally snaked a kiss under false pretenses.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m a little proud of that, yeah.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m a lock for next year.
 <br>
 I introduced myself to everyone.
 <br>
 And I know they liked me, &#39;cause they laughed at everything I said.
 <br>
 I mean, I even shook hands with that nose-picking, chess-club guy.
 <br>
 Ooh, I&#39;d better wash up.
 <br>
 - You ready? - Yeah.
 <br>
 (Jackie Screaming )
