 How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a toosie pop? One Two-hoo.
 <br>
 Ah, screw it.
 <br>
 Ow, my tooth! Oh, why did I have to bite it? Eric, if you don&#39;t want to wear your ass for a hat, you&#39;ll get up here, pronto! You better go.
 <br>
 You know how that ass-hat screws up your hair.
 <br>
 Poor Forman, man.
 <br>
 Working for Red like that.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t wish that on my enemies.
 <br>
 I would.
 <br>
 Those suckas must pay! Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 Michael,why don&#39;t you save the sweet talk for the next idiot who&#39;s dumb enough to date you.
 <br>
 You know, Jackie, if you are in the market for a new lover, they say, once you go Fez, you never go back.
 <br>
 In my language that rhymes.
 <br>
 Okay, Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Donna? She&#39;s upstairs with Forman.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t follow me, Michael.
 <br>
 We&#39;re broken up and I mean it.
 <br>
 Oh, I wasn&#39;t! And thank God we&#39;re broken up, because Damn, I miss her! Well, golly gee, Kelso, who wouldn&#39;t? Oh, spare me the sarcasm, Hyde.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really hurting here and I&#39;m totally lonely Man, I&#39;ve seen people gut-shot who complain less than you.
 <br>
 Kelso, What do you miss about her ? All she ever did was call you names.
 <br>
 Heck, I can do that for you.
 <br>
 You idiot.
 <br>
 See? Aw, thanks, Fez.
 <br>
 No problem.
 <br>
 Fartface! You know what the great thing about whistling ? You can stop whistling! Oh.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Eric, bend your knees and lift with your legs or else I&#39;m gonna-- Kick my ass, put your foot in my ass, make my ass a hat, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 Geez, and I didn&#39;t think you were listening.
 <br>
 Oh, and I need you to re-sticker the clock radios.
 <br>
 They&#39;re on sale.
 <br>
 Yeah, I saw the flyer.
 <br>
 I already took care of it.
 <br>
 Really? Well, way to show initiative &#34;Way to show initiative&#34;? What are you up to? Nothing.
 <br>
 I just think you did a god job.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m watching you.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Sorry I&#39;m late, Red.
 <br>
 My dog was hit by a car, and I had to rush him to the vet.
 <br>
 Earl, your god got hit on Tuesday, too.
 <br>
 How dumb is that dog.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Red.
 <br>
 I know you gave me a break, &#39;cause we worked to the plant together.
 <br>
 And I appreciate it.
 <br>
 I swear it&#39;s the last time.
 <br>
 Earl, Why can&#39;t you be more like Eric? I mean, He&#39;s eighteen-- Dad, I&#39;m seventeen.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m talking here.
 <br>
 And he&#39;s got a better work ethic than you.
 <br>
 Oh, no doubt there, Red.
 <br>
 You can tell he&#39;s your son, &#39;cause he&#39;s just super, - Earl, just get to work okay.
 <br>
 - Sure, right after a cup of joe, I&#39;m useless without my cofee.
 <br>
 Wow,  I guess he hasn&#39;t had coffee in years, huh? Hey, that&#39;s pretty funny! Okay, what&#39;s up with you! Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going? How&#39;s it going? Great! Just because a guy shoots hoops by himself, that  doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s lonely.
 <br>
 No, far from it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna? All this talk about being lonely kind of reminds me of me, you know? Kelso, are you gonna get all emotional? &#39;Cause just &#39;cause I&#39;m a girl doesn&#39;t mean that I won&#39;t totally make fun of you.
 <br>
 Fair enough.
 <br>
 I know I keep things bottled up, but under this cool exterior, there&#39;s a real sad human being.
 <br>
 Oh, God, Kelso, is this about Jackie? Yes! What gave it away? The fact that it&#39;s all you ever talk about, you stupid dillhole.
 <br>
 Look,Kelso, get it through your head.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s not coming back to you.
 <br>
 But why? Because you slept with someone else! Yeah, like a month ago, God! I just realized Jackie&#39;s short.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t like short people.
 <br>
 They&#39;re creepy.
 <br>
 Always sneaking up on you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even know why I was with her.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;s because she is a tiny little whore.
 <br>
 Oh, I meant to hurt you, but I hurt myself because I love her.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, I really cracked Red up today.
 <br>
 And not by tripping, or getting wet, or vomiting-- Did you bump your head? That&#39;s good stuff.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I made a joke, and he got it! At work, we&#39;re like just two guys, brought together by the common goal of slashing prices on all your household needs.
 <br>
 Plus, man, it&#39;s so great to see him chew out other people.
 <br>
 Yeah, Forman, now you know how we feel when he yells at you.
 <br>
 It really is hilarious.
 <br>
 You get all bug-eyed and stuttery.
 <br>
 Fellas, I&#39;ve been thinking.
 <br>
 There are a lot of ladies out there.
 <br>
 And I haven&#39;t seen nearly enough of them naked.
 <br>
 Sometimes I am looking at naked ladies, and then I get exhausted and then I get a second wind and I am ready for more naked ladies.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like, at work there&#39;s this guy, Earl,he&#39;s a real screw-up right.
 <br>
 So Red gets pretty P.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 ed.
 <br>
 But that deflects all of Red&#39;s anger from me.
 <br>
 So I mean, Earl&#39;s like.
 <br>
 a &#34;dumbass&#34; lightning rod.
 <br>
 I hear ya.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll only work with the barely-competent.
 <br>
 It takes the stress out of slacking off.
 <br>
 Man it feels great to be free of that midget.
 <br>
 The world is my oyster, and I&#39;m ready to shuck it.
 <br>
 Nothing but hot new ladies from here on in.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be boldly going where no man&#39;s gone before.
 <br>
 Hi, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here to pick up Laurie.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You mean, Eric.
 <br>
 No, Laurie.
 <br>
 Your other kid.
 <br>
 But, but, why? You&#39;re dating Laurie? That&#39;s not different, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re boldly going where every man&#39;s gone before.
 <br>
 Steven! It&#39;s not nice to be so truthful.
 <br>
 Hi, Kelso.
 <br>
 Did you buy me those? Yep.
 <br>
 Just like you told me.
 <br>
 No, I told you roses.
 <br>
 Come on, doofus.
 <br>
 No offense, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, but those two could make the dumbest babies ever.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not funny.
 <br>
 - Speaking of work-- - We weren&#39;t talking about work.
 <br>
 Work, right.
 <br>
 Dad and I really put in some hard hours today.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t we, Pop? Yep.
 <br>
 Eric really busted his hump down there.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m just so happy my two fellas work so well together.
 <br>
 Hey, how&#39;s Earl doin&#39;? He&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 But his damn dog can&#39;t go a day without getting hit by a car.
 <br>
 At least I got one good man down there.
 <br>
 Right back at ya, big guy.
 <br>
 Well, that Earl&#39;s always been a character.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And today, he was late, and Dad said get to work, and he said, &#34;Sorry, Red, I&#39;m useless without my coffee,&#34; and then I said, &#34;He must not have had coffee in years!&#34; Right, right? Oh, that&#39;s cute.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not even my best Earl&#39;s joke, okay ready, &#39;knock knock, who&#39;s there?&#39; it&#39;s not Earl, &#39;cause he&#39;s late.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m guessin&#39; Earl&#39;s not short for early.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a good one Red.
 <br>
 I got one, The one&#39;s girl in the tucket - okay, okay Hey, Laurie, could you GET OUUUT !! Thanks.
 <br>
 C&#39;mon, Kelso, come up to my room.
 <br>
 I need you to help me move my bookcase.
 <br>
 That means we&#39;re gonna have sex.
 <br>
 Yeah, thanks for cracking that code.
 <br>
 what are you doing? They&#39;re going to have sex! Get the wax out of your ears! Man, You can&#39;t bring my sister down to the basement, this is our &#34;Fortress of Solitude&#34; Well, I&#39;m sorry, but she&#39;s my girlfriend and I love her.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Well, I like her.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 I think she is okay.
 <br>
 And the line between &#34;love&#34; and &#34;okay&#34; is pretty fine.
 <br>
 But the line between &#34;doing it&#34; and &#34;not doing it,&#34; that&#39;s not fine at all! Just like the line between &#34;moron&#34; and &#34;idiot.
 <br>
 &#34; Exactly.
 <br>
 It took me months to get Jackie in the sack.
 <br>
 But Laurie, she already let me do it and plus, I&#39;m over here all the time anyways.
 <br>
 So, there&#39;s like the convenience factor.
 <br>
 Kelso, my book case isn&#39;t going to move itself.
 <br>
 Or maybe it will.
 <br>
 Damn! I gotta go! Dumbest babies ever! Jackie, it&#39;s great to see you so happy.
 <br>
 And strong.
 <br>
 And over Kelso.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like a rock.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like a tiny little rock.
 <br>
 Donna, are you trying to tell me bad news? Or are you making fun of my butt? - No, your butt&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 - Fine?! Glorious, whatever.
 <br>
 Look, uh, Kelso&#39;s dating Laurie.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Oh, come on,how can you still have feelings for him? Donna, I don&#39;t have feelings for him.
 <br>
 I just hate that bitch for making him happy.
 <br>
 Oh, believe me, Jackie, she will make him more miserable than you ever did.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, thank you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna pray to God that you&#39;re right Laurie, I have to talk to you.
 <br>
 Kelso, we gotta confab, man.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Too many times, I have sat idly by and watched you make bad choices.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve seen you screw up an awful lot.
 <br>
 And sure, I&#39;ve enjoyed it.
 <br>
 But now, you&#39;ve gone too far.
 <br>
 Do you know what this is about? Duh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not an idiot.
 <br>
 Nuh-uh.
 <br>
 Michael has some nice qualities, but Laurie&#39;s got great legs and a fine rack, but he&#39;s just a boy.
 <br>
 she&#39;s a major skankoid.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t know where a boy like that will end up.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t know where a girl like that has been.
 <br>
 Now, I know you want a boyfriend who&#39;s weak and easily manipulated Now, I know you&#39;re weak and easily manipulated but you&#39;re got to learn to think about the future.
 <br>
 but you&#39;ve got to learn to think.
 <br>
 And make smart choises, &#39;Cause, what&#39;s convenient isn&#39;t always what&#39;s best.
 <br>
 If it were I&#39;d just throw on a muumuu and eat out of a can.
 <br>
 If it were this frozen pizza wouldn&#39;t taste like monkey-butt.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Are you done with this little lecture? Okay.
 <br>
 Are you done with that pizza? Yes.
 <br>
 And I thik I made my point.
 <br>
 God, I gotta get my own place.
 <br>
 This doesn&#39;t taste like monkey-butt! Aw, geez, Red, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late for our little meeting.
 <br>
 My dog uh, car got hit by a car.
 <br>
 Accident, that&#39;s the word.
 <br>
 Eric, you need to take your break anywhere but here.
 <br>
 Earl, you&#39;re fired.

 <br>
 Let him go? You yelled at him until he cried.
 <br>
 Hey, what kind of man cries after only fiftenn minutes of yelling? Well, I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t like the way you handled Earl.
 <br>
 Dad, He was your friend.
 <br>
 Eric, hush shush hush hush.
 <br>
 Eric, Work is work.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t show up late, you don&#39;t make excuses, and you don&#39;t not work.
 <br>
 If it wasn&#39;t &#34;work,&#34; they wouldn&#39;t call it work.
 <br>
 They&#39;d call it &#34;super-wonderful, crazy-fun time!&#34; Or &#34;Skippedydoo!&#34; Aw, geez, why the hell am I even talking to you? Oh, Eric, why&#39;d you have to upset your father? What, I can&#39;t have my own opinion without him tearing my head off? No, and I think at your age, you should know that by now.
 <br>
 Well, no, Mom, no.
 <br>
 Uh-uh.
 <br>
 We had such a good thing going at work, and he wrecked it.
 <br>
 And by the way, without Earl, I&#39;m back to dumbass.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just mean.
 <br>
 Oh, you shut your porky mouth, mister.
 <br>
 Well then, it just stinks,because you know what it&#39;s the first time that we were ever, like,you know, cool with each other.
 <br>
 Man, Why does he have to be such a hard ass all the time? Oh, come on, Eric.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how he expresses himself.
 <br>
 That&#39;s always how he&#39;s expressed himself.
 <br>
 Your father yells at you because he cares.
 <br>
 Yeah, right, well, if that&#39;s true, then Stand up straight.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a dumbass.
 <br>
 You call this a report card? Hands above the covers Oh, I guess he really really cares.
 <br>
 And if not you&#39;re moving out soon.
 <br>
 So you know who I hate? Laurie.
 <br>
 Oh, Jackie, I know you are upset and in pain, but you&#39;re not  going to talk during the Hollwood Squares, are you? Well I mean, I really do hate her.
 <br>
 No offense, Eric, but your sister&#39;s a slut.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, Jackie, not since the &#34;Smokey versus Bandit&#34; debate have you and I been so on the same page.
 <br>
 Yeah, I think we&#39;re all on board.
 <br>
 Oh God! This is so great.
 <br>
 You guys all hate Laurie and love me.
 <br>
 Yeah we all hate Laurie.
 <br>
 Shush! Oh, great, Lambchop had a joke, and I missed it! Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Oh, Hi, Michael.
 <br>
 Kelso, as your new girlfriend, I&#39;m really not comfortable with your old girlfriend hanging out down here.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Jackie, do you mind? No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t mind if you leave.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not leaving.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not either.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not either.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Hey, this is my house.
 <br>
 So what? Eric wants me here, don&#39;t you, Eric? Why, yes I do! You better watch your back.
 <br>
 Really? cause you shouldn&#39;t spend so much time on yours.
 <br>
 Oh, burn! Hey, I&#39;m Sorry, I just got swept away by the super good burn.
 <br>
 Shut up! Jackie, that was an excellent burn.
 <br>
 Thank you, Fez.
 <br>
 Now, please sit next to Fez-- --Move it! What the hell were you doing in the shower so long? You know, it wastes water and I might be late.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m definitely not gonna be the first person there.
 <br>
 You know how that makes me look? Damn it, you gotta grow up and learn some responsibility.
 <br>
 I love you, too, Dad.
 <br>
 Stop being weird.
 <br>
 Thanks.
