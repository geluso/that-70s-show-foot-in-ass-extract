<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, Still mad at me about the Christmas party? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just starting to realize you might never be the man I dreamed you&#39;d be.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the spirit.
 <br>
 Lower your expectations.
 <br>
 Well, I have one last wedding thing to return, And once this is done, the only thing I&#39;ll have left to remind me we almost got married will be you.
 <br>
 Oh Well, I wish Eric had shown up for your wedding.
 <br>
 The sales lady said my mother-Of-The-Groom dress took 5 pounds off me.
 <br>
 Okay, what happened to my nice breakfast? I thought we were done with this whole wedding deal.
 <br>
 Women are never done with it, son.
 <br>
 Anything wrong you do, They sit on it for And then it hatches on super bowl sunday.
 <br>
 Oh, man, I can&#39;t believe I have to take these shoes back to wanamaker bridal.
 <br>
 Now I have to tell that snot Stacy Wanamaker that I didn&#39;t get married.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, I&#39;ll take them back for you.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve always wanted to meet stacy wanamaker.
 <br>
 I mean, she&#39;s everything I&#39;ve ever wanted to be-- Gorgeous, popular, which, of course, I already am, But she&#39;s also married And to a guy who owns a real estate company that puts her face on his signs.
 <br>
 Oh, she&#39;s like a kennedy.
 <br>
 Yeah, stacy wanamaker was a high school legend.
 <br>
 All the guys would say, &#34;I do Wanna make her.
 <br>
 &#34; I always wish I had a name that could be done to.
 <br>
 Jackie has a nice rackie? I like Jackie on her backie? Oh thanks, you guys.
 <br>
 Well, thanks for dinner.
 <br>
 Thanks for dessert.
 <br>
 Thanks for breakfast.
 <br>
 Thanks for dessert.
 <br>
 Congratulations, Angie.
 <br>
 You just got four different kinds of herpes.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde, I just learned something very important.
 <br>
 You know that saying, it&#39;s like kissing your sister? Well, it&#39;s totally wrong &#39;cause kissing your sister is great.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, there&#39;s stacy wanamaker.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here to return these shoes.
 <br>
 - Name? - Donna Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Good heavens, these are for a giant.
 <br>
 Were they too big? Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 The wedding was canceled.
 <br>
 Yeah, the groom said, &#34;I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, Donna, how awful.
 <br>
 What? Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 I-- I just know how complete being married has made me, And I always feel so sad when I see girls your age whose window to find that kind of happiness Is so, so small.
 <br>
 It is not that small.
 <br>
 Honey, I&#39;ve seen a lot of girls like you who wasted years on a guy who never came through, And before you know it, you&#39;re past your expiration date.
 <br>
 Well, that is not gonna happen to me because I&#39;m still getting married.
 <br>
 Yeah, see, I canceled the other wedding &#39;cause I traded in-- Up.
 <br>
 - Him.
 <br>
 - Who? - You.
 <br>
 - What? Yes.
 <br>
 This is eduardo and he&#39;s, um A prince.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the prince of mexico.
 <br>
 Well, then we are going to make your wedding the best wedding ever, right, Donna? Donna? - Apparently, that&#39;s you.
 <br>
 - Oh, yes.
 <br>
 What? Yes.
 <br>
 You just have to come to the big wedding expo this weekend.
 <br>
 Oh, well, that sounds great.
 <br>
 Eduardo and I would love to be there.
 <br>
 Right, Eduardo? Just a few weeks left to stretch those wings, huh, toots? Eduardo! What? Oh, yes, my bride.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 12 &#34;Don&#39;t Lie To Me&#34; Hey.
 <br>
 Oh, Hyde, Angie can&#39;t make it to the movie with you because, uh Well, I plumb wore her out.
 <br>
 Kelso, Jackie and i are fighting right now And I&#39;m in a really bad mood, So if you don&#39;t stop nailing my sister, I&#39;m gonna have to smack you in the head with my car.
 <br>
 Actually, you can&#39;t do anything to me because Because after you stole Jackie from me, we made a pact not to interfere with each other&#39;s pursuit of a chick.
 <br>
 I negotiated the pact, Which mainly consisted of Kelso telling me to tell Hyde to sit on it.
 <br>
 How come you guys always have pacts? You never give me a pact.
 <br>
 I want a pact.
 <br>
 Well, I would love to stick around and chat, But I gotta go home and take a shower &#39;cause Hyde&#39;s sister wears a lot of perfume, And she was all over me.
 <br>
 Friggin&#39; pact.
 <br>
 You know, Hyde, This doesn&#39;t have to be a problem.
 <br>
 I happen to know a lot of ways out of a pact, my friend.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 We once had a pact to get married, but then he just didn&#39;t show up.
 <br>
 So you think you can get her to break up with him? Maybe, But that would require you and I going into business together, I.
 <br>
 E.
 <br>
 Forming a pact, Which would mean You gotta do something for me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think so, man.
 <br>
 This is a starter pact.
 <br>
 You handle this, You get a big-Boy pact.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, Eric.
 <br>
 A starter pact? I mean, that sounds a lot like training wheels, and you were on those for a really long time.
 <br>
 Stacy, hi.
 <br>
 Donna, welcome.
 <br>
 Here is your bride-To-Be sash And a tiara.
 <br>
 Can I get a sash? What do you do with a sash? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I want a sash.
 <br>
 Welcome to the beginning of a whole new life.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 This really is a whole new life.
 <br>
 Oh, did you get some champagne, too? Oh, I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I&#39;m six months pregnant.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t you tell? I&#39;m huge.
 <br>
 She&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 Now, eduardo, you&#39;ll have no say in any of the decisions about your wedding, So go sit in the groom&#39;s lounge.
 <br>
 Oh, goody, new friends.
 <br>
 - Hey! - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 &#34;Hey&#34; Oh, perfect, Everyone&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Well, look at all of us just Packed right in here, huh? Mom, dad, you remember Angie.
 <br>
 Of course they remember me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the only black girl in town.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Funny thing about Angie-- She dates Kelso.
 <br>
 - Ohh, honey.
 <br>
 - Tough break.
 <br>
 So anyone have any stories about Angie&#39;s new boyfriend And some of his crazy antics? What do you want? I got one with water, One with fire, One where he burned himself underwater.
 <br>
 Oh, Okay, I got a good one.
 <br>
 Michael, what are you doing with my blender? Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not what you think.
 <br>
 I&#39;m making a blender rocket.
 <br>
 I couldn&#39;t have daiquiris for a week.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a better one.
 <br>
 Kelso, it&#39;s 6 in the morning.
 <br>
 Did someone glue you to the fridge? No.
 <br>
 Kelso, Did you glue yourself to the fridge? Yes.
 <br>
 Thanks, man.
 <br>
 Why does he glue himself to stuff? Because he&#39;s a big dum-Dum.
 <br>
 Next? Okay, I got one.
 <br>
 Donna, check it out.
 <br>
 I invented car skiing.
 <br>
 Hit it, toots! You know, if there&#39;s anything he should have glued himself to, It was probably the top of that car.
 <br>
 Steven Why are you doing this? Doing what? Forman&#39;s doing it.
 <br>
 Clearly you&#39;re in charge.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my pact.
 <br>
 Why wouldn&#39;t you think I&#39;m in charge? Oh, it&#39;s probably because of your narrow shoulders, honey.
 <br>
 They just Don&#39;t shout &#34;leader,&#34; you know? Oh, and jim raises a lipstick.
 <br>
 Pretty confident, huh, jim? That&#39;s right, I am all in.
 <br>
 Okay, read &#39;em and weep-- Two, four, six, eight, ten.
 <br>
 All evens.
 <br>
 Stacy, this is so much fun.
 <br>
 You know, I never thought I&#39;d end up here.
 <br>
 Steven never wants to discuss marriage.
 <br>
 Steven? My butler-- He is so uppity.
 <br>
 Eduardo, where&#39;s my purse? I was mugged.
 <br>
 Donna, come to my cousin&#39;s wedding this weekend and check out her band.
 <br>
 All right, we&#39;ll be there.
 <br>
 No, we won&#39;t, Donna.
 <br>
 It&#39;s insane.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 My fiancée told me I have to give this back.
 <br>
 Angie just broke up with me.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what happened.
 <br>
 She just dumped me, Like, out of nowhere, and I was gonna take her car skiing.
 <br>
 I need a hug from your mother.
 <br>
 Take off the training wheels, buddy, &#39;cause it looks like somebody&#39;s ready for his big-Boy pact.
 <br>
 Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to go pull Kelso off my mother.
 <br>
 Jackie, we&#39;re not really going to this wedding, are we? I have to, Fez.
 <br>
 It feels so good to be a fiancée.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re not a fiancée.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a super cute high school girl that I&#39;ve been spying on through a window for three and a half years.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that enough? Hey, What&#39;s up? Nothing.
 <br>
 Usually when I ask that question, you don&#39;t stop talking till I pretend to fall asleep.
 <br>
 Ah, well, not today.
 <br>
 You look guilty.
 <br>
 What did you do? Fez, what did she do? Oh, I wasn&#39;t listening.
 <br>
 I was thinking about this prince named eduardo and his lunatic queen.
 <br>
 Seriously, Steven, everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 All right, But I&#39;m telling you, There&#39;s gonna be hell to pay if you&#39;ve donated all my clothes to the goodwill again.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;re lying to Hyde? This must stop, woman.
 <br>
 Fez, I know it&#39;s a little crazy, but what if this is all I get? I mean, what if steven never wants to settle down? What if I never get a real wedding or real happiness or real anything? Or real happiness or real anything? What if I&#39;m just living in my pink bedroom alone forever? Fine, I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 But please remember, you&#39;re never alone in there.
 <br>
 I called Angie, like, 20 times, and she won&#39;t even answer the phone.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I guess something really turned her off, Something incredibly Powerful.
 <br>
 All right, So I&#39;ve narrowed it down to two reasons why Angie might have broken up with me-- She&#39;s either a lesbian or a robot.
 <br>
 Come on, man, it&#39;s just a girl.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll get over it.
 <br>
 Hey, do something for you- Take up smoking.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna get over it.
 <br>
 I just want Angie back.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going home.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 He really liked her.
 <br>
 I feel like I kicked a puppy.
 <br>
 Well, this is what happens when you get into a pact with Eric Forman-- Complete and utter devastation.
 <br>
 What? So, Fez, what do you think? You like my dress? Yeah, it&#39;s okay, but you know what would be more appropriate? A straight jacket Because you&#39;re a looney tune.
 <br>
 - But, Fez-- - I said cuckoo! Donna, eduardo, I want you to meet my cousin janie.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 It is so nice to see two people declare their love in such an expensive way.
 <br>
 So, janie, you are looking good.
 <br>
 What are you doing later? Um, going on my honeymoon.
 <br>
 You play hard-To-Get.
 <br>
 I play hard-To-Get-Rid-Of.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 Y.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 --For your wedding, Donna, tables one and two, where we&#39;re sitting, are the popular tables.
 <br>
 Tables five and up are your friends you have to invite And relatives who drive trucks.
 <br>
 We are gonna get caught.
 <br>
 No, we&#39;re not, Fez, okay? No one knows us here.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe they put us at table seven.
 <br>
 I went to high school with the bride&#39;s mother.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m milking the open bar as punishment.
 <br>
 Well, hell, we could have stayed home for that.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, I&#39;m not wearing any underwear under this.
 <br>
 Does that, uh, Does that turn you on? No.
 <br>
 - That only works when I do it.
 <br>
 - Ooh.
 <br>
 Well, sucks to be the next guy to rent this tux, huh? All right, Angie, here&#39;s the deal.
 <br>
 I did want everybody to tell you those stories about Kelso, And that was wrong Because he really likes you, So you have to take him back.
 <br>
 Steven this is so unlike you.
 <br>
 Well, A friend of mine sent me a really big baggie from hawaii So I&#39;m gonna be saying all sorts of crazy stuff over the next couple weeks.
 <br>
 Well, I didn&#39;t break up with Michael because of the stories.
 <br>
 I broke up with him because I saw it was bothering you, And we have a business to run.
 <br>
 Look, just Do me a favor and take him back.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll think about it.
 <br>
 Oh, man, Hyde, It is not easy doing it on your desk.
 <br>
 Okay, so I may have already thought about it.
 <br>
 He&#39;s so good-Looking.
 <br>
 It&#39;s stacy wanamaker.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 I do wanna make her Uh, go to beauty school &#39;cause she&#39;s ugly.
 <br>
 You look familiar.
 <br>
 Do I know you? Um, yeah, hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Donna Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 Donna, she says she&#39;s Donna.
 <br>
 Donna? Donna? Donna? Donna! Eduardo.
 <br>
 No, she&#39;s Donna.
 <br>
 Why would you lie? Are you even engaged? Can&#39;t believe a prince was taken in by a common liar.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey, how was the wedding? Well, The service was beautiful, the flowers were gorgeous, And your girlfriend was a humiliating wackadoo.
 <br>
 Jackie was there? Are we still walking from the car? This is taking forever.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey, Thought you&#39;d be on a plane back to prince eduardoland by now.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s mouth is as big as her feet.
 <br>
 Jackie, what the hell were you thinking? Look, Steven, I know it&#39;s a crazy thing to do.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just I wanted to know what it was like to be planning a life and a wedding and everything.
 <br>
 I mean, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever wanted, And I was starting to think it was never gonna happen with you.
 <br>
 Are we back on this again? Why can&#39;t you just be happy with what we&#39;ve got? Because I&#39;m not, Steven! Look, I need to know that we have a future together.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t you just give me some kind of sign or just a tiny glimmer of hope that maybe someday we&#39;ll get married? Jackie, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all you ever say! Please, Steven, please, just say anything besides &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Anything else! I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, then I can&#39;t be with you anymore.
 <br>
 Jackie, Don&#39;t threaten me, okay? It&#39;s not gonna work.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not threatening you, Steven.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t waste any more of my time on you if it&#39;s not gonna happen for us.
 <br>
 Okay, well, at least now I know.
 <br>
 Janie? Janie? Has anyone seen the bride? The limo&#39;s waiting and the groom&#39;s gonna pass out any second Janie? Janie, what are you doing? What are you doing? Have a little respect for the bride.
 <br>
 Unless you wanna join us, Yes? No?
 <br>
