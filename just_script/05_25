<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Ah, my last American Popsicle washed down by my last American grape soda.
 <br>
 Fez, it&#39;s sad you&#39;re getting deported but this &#34;last American&#34; crap&#39;s getting annoying.
 <br>
 Ah, my last American chance to annoy you.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Come on, Fez.
 <br>
 Look on the bright side.
 <br>
 I mean, we graduate tomorrow.
 <br>
 You go to your country with a high school diploma they&#39;ll probably make you, like, head medicine man or something.
 <br>
 Eric, there is no bright side about going back to a place where people are outnumbered by lizards.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna miss you, man.
 <br>
 When you get there, can you mail me a lizard? - Eric, guess what came for you? - Hey.
 <br>
 They just send those to me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even find those girls attractive.
 <br>
 No, you perv.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the key to our new apartment in Madison.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 - Now we can leave tomorrow after graduation like we wanted.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 By this time next week, our new neighbors will be hearing your cries of love through our paper-thin walls.
 <br>
 Cries of love? Or cries of disappointment? Oh, I don&#39;t want to go.
 <br>
 Come on, Fez.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like we&#39;re never gonna see you again.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure in a couple months you&#39;ll be, like on the cover of National Geographic.
 <br>
 Yeah, those bastards are always so intrusive.
 <br>
 Fez, look.
 <br>
 At least we&#39;re going camping tonight.
 <br>
 - We&#39;ll all be together for our last blowout.
 <br>
 - It won&#39;t be all of us.
 <br>
 Kelso can&#39;t make it on account of he&#39;s got a broken face.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t got a broken face.
 <br>
 You will if you keep interfering with me getting Jackie back.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the one that&#39;s interfering.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m going and Jackie&#39;s going, and you&#39;re staying home.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 You are.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 You are.
 <br>
 - Fine, stay home then.
 <br>
 - I will.
 <br>
 Hey, stop it.
 <br>
 Would you please put aside your differences and go camping with me? We only have a few hours left together.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go for you.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Now, I am off to spend the rest of my American money on candy and porno.
 <br>
 - But, Fez- - I said, candy and porno.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie? You&#39;re gonna love these cookies on the camping trip.
 <br>
 They&#39;re sweet and tasty, just like me.
 <br>
 Kelso, this apple&#39;s kind of like you too.
 <br>
 You mean juicy and delicious? - No.
 <br>
 Red and bruised.
 <br>
 - Agh! Yeah? Well, these hot dogs are like you, too, Hyde.
 <br>
 They&#39;re, uh- - Kosher.
 <br>
 - Yeah, kosher! - Wait, what&#39;s kosher? - That means blessed by a rabbi.
 <br>
 Burn! Jackie, are you sure you want to go camping? These idiots are gonna be competing over you the whole time.
 <br>
 Well, I am glad, Donna.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve both jerked me around so much I cannot wait to watch &#39;em fight over me.
 <br>
 You know, if you really want to mess with them, you should do it with me.
 <br>
 Hey, talk about humiliating.
 <br>
 So, you guys are going to the lake, huh? It is real fun up there.
 <br>
 My senior year, I set the record for most topless rides on the rope swing.
 <br>
 I wish I was goin&#39;.
 <br>
 Yeah, don&#39;t even think about it, Laurie.
 <br>
 There are enough scary things in the woods already.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m being deported, and she&#39;s loose with the boobs.
 <br>
 She goes.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman.
 <br>
 Your mom just came back from the loony doctor.
 <br>
 She got real depressed when she heard you guys were moving to Madison, huh? Yeah, you&#39;re tellin&#39; me.
 <br>
 Last night she was making sounds that were giving my dad war flashbacks.
 <br>
 What a beautiful day.
 <br>
 I feel- I feel like a rainbow.
 <br>
 Anyone else feel like a rainbow? - What happened to her? - [Pills Rattling]  [Singing Folk Rock]  [Ends] I wrote that just for you, Jackie.
 <br>
 He didn&#39;t write that.
 <br>
 He ripped it off from &#34;American Pie.
 <br>
 &#34; Nah-uh.
 <br>
 The &#34;American Pie&#34; guy ripped me off.
 <br>
 - You shut up, man.
 <br>
 - You shut up! Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna freak everyone out and tell my ghost story so go hide in the woods and jump out when I get to the end.
 <br>
 [British Accent] You are as wicked as you are gorgeous.
 <br>
 You know, it really creeps me out being up here after what happened to those kids.
 <br>
 What kids? A bunch of kids just like us were camping out up here and they disappeared.
 <br>
 And all the police could find were these bloody drag marks that led down to the lake.
 <br>
 It was like- It was like something killed them and then pulled them in.
 <br>
 Maybe it was the Loch Ness Monster.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Fez, the Loch Ness Monster&#39;s in Africa.
 <br>
 So the police, like, searched the lake with their sonar and stuff and when they played back the tapes all they could hear in the background was, like, a whisper.
 <br>
 What did it say? &#34;I am the Lady of the Lake.
 <br>
 I am the Lady of the Lake.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah.
 <br>
 And you&#39;ll know when she&#39;s coming, because she screams before she kills.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see if we can hear her.
 <br>
 I said, let&#39;s see if we can hear her.
 <br>
 [Eric] D- Donna, I&#39;m stuck in a thornbush.
 <br>
 I heard her.
 <br>
 She&#39;s stuck in a thornbush.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kind of cold.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll reward who ever gets more firewood by letting them feed me marshmallows.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna go running around the woods trying to impress you.
 <br>
 I will.
 <br>
 Damn it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go take a walk down to the lake.
 <br>
 [Thinking] She&#39;s going to the lake, old boy.
 <br>
 That means topless rope-swinging.
 <br>
 Now, do you want to spend your last hours in America eating s&#39;mores? Or watching her glorious breasts swinging in the chilly night air? I choose boobs.
 <br>
 This is so strange, you know? It&#39;s, like, our last night all together.
 <br>
 It&#39;s too weird to think about.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s, like, do something to get our minds off it.
 <br>
 Well, here&#39;s the tent.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go inside, strip down and just lay there- Let&#39;s go skinny-dipping.
 <br>
 Meet me down by the lake in five minutes.
 <br>
 Wait, so- I have to walk all the way down to the lake by myself? Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 Here you go, Kitty.
 <br>
 Home sweet home.
 <br>
 I went into my closet to get a jacket.
 <br>
 I found Kitty standin&#39; in there.
 <br>
 I like the way the coats felt on my arms.
 <br>
 Oh, yes.
 <br>
 Why, there you are, my little sex muffin.
 <br>
 - Little brother? - [Screams] [Screams] [Screams] What the hell was that? It&#39;s the Lady of the Lake! She screams and then she kills! [Thinking] There&#39;s Laurie.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Time to turn on the charm.
 <br>
 Hey, Laurie, are you naked, or you just happy to see me? - Oh, my God! Fez! - Oh, my God! Donna! [Thinking] Steady, old boy.
 <br>
 Say something smooth.
 <br>
 Nice honkers.
 <br>
 - Get out of here! - Hey, you like the rough stuff, eh? It was awful.
 <br>
 I saw Laurie, and everything just went blank.
 <br>
 And I just ran, Donna.
 <br>
 I just ran away.
 <br>
 And then I heard these high-pitched screams.
 <br>
 And it was me.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, I&#39;ve got bigger problems.
 <br>
 Fez is a good artist.
 <br>
 He&#39;s gonna paint me onto a nudie poster and sell it to every gaucho in Argentina, or wherever the hell he&#39;s from.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m gonna be Ms.
 <br>
 Nude Argentina.
 <br>
 You know, being here under the stars sitting in the grass makes me really glad I&#39;m not poor.
 <br>
 Man, check out that fire, baby.
 <br>
 Yeah, if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;m good at, it&#39;s turning a small fire into a big fire.
 <br>
 Man, that one guitar-shaped log is roarin&#39;.
 <br>
 What the- Is that my guitar? Yep.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got a nice, warm sound.
 <br>
 - Dead! - Back off, man.
 <br>
 Jackie doesn&#39;t want you.
 <br>
 Yeah? She still has feelings for me and you know it! Okay, okay, okay.
 <br>
 Stop it! This isn&#39;t fun for me anymore! What? What do you mean fun for you? I didn&#39;t say that.
 <br>
 Yeah, you did.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 What are you trying to do? You&#39;re getting your kicks off of watching us jump through hoops over you.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 We didn&#39;t jump through hoops.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good at that.
 <br>
 I would have won that.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m done with this crap, Jackie.
 <br>
 You choose right now.
 <br>
 Me or him.
 <br>
 Yeah, who&#39;s it gonna be? - Wait.
 <br>
 What? No.
 <br>
 L- - What&#39;s the matter? You don&#39;t know? No, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Drama.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 For a second there I almost forgot about my sister&#39;s wet, naked ass.
 <br>
 Oh, God! Yeah, where is Laurie? And where&#39;s Fez? That was incredible, huh? It was okay.
 <br>
 Okay&#39;s good enough for me.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the mountain air or the poison from that thornbush but I slept great.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 It&#39;s almost 10:30.
 <br>
 We&#39;re late for graduation.
 <br>
 Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Guys? Guys, where&#39;s the van? I think it&#39;s obvious, Jackie.
 <br>
 The Lady of the Lake stole it.
 <br>
 - Why would a ghost need a van? - What&#39;s she gonna do, hitch a ride? Who&#39;s gonna pick up a ghost? And you&#39;re telling me you can&#39;t decide between us? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Fez and Laurie.
 <br>
 - They probably took it to mess with us.
 <br>
 - Aw, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna kill &#39;em.
 <br>
 Eric, if I&#39;m right about the Lady of the Lake, and I think I am they might already be dead.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe those morons missed their own graduation.
 <br>
 My whole life I waited to hear the Pinciotti name called at graduation.
 <br>
 When they skipped from Olendorff to Stevens a little part of me died.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get you a hoagie.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve got to have a little conversation about those pills you&#39;re taking.
 <br>
 These things? I think they&#39;re working wonders.
 <br>
 You know, I didn&#39;t cry once when Eric got his diploma.
 <br>
 I just smiled and took his picture.
 <br>
 That wasn&#39;t Eric.
 <br>
 That was some skinny girl with a Dorothy Hamill haircut.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s not fair, Red.
 <br>
 You-You teach your children how to- how to walk, to-to use a fork to-to look both ways before crossing the street and then one day you realize all you&#39;re doing is teaching them how to leave.
 <br>
 We should never have potty-trained him.
 <br>
 Listen, Kitty.
 <br>
 We did the kid thing and it was great.
 <br>
 But now I&#39;m looking forward to it just being the two of us again.
 <br>
 This is our time.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s enjoy it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, Red.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need those.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Whenever I feel like I&#39;m on the verge of a nervous breakdown, I&#39;ll just come talk to you.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll just give you one of these.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 What a great day.
 <br>
 Not only did we get to miss our own graduation but we got to ride home in the back of a pig truck.
 <br>
 Yeah, when we went around a corner one of those pigs almost went to third base on me.
 <br>
 You know what? I need a shower.
 <br>
 Hang on.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not going anywhere.
 <br>
 - You haven&#39;t given us an answer yet.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s it gonna be? You know what? I can&#39;t talk about love right now.
 <br>
 The bottom of my jeans have something brown on them.
 <br>
 - Where the hell have you been? - I have waited 18 years for my graduation picture.
 <br>
 I want you all back here at 5:00 sharp in your caps and gowns, ready to say cheese.
 <br>
 Is that clear? - Fine.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 - Yes, Mom.
 <br>
 Hey? What kind of a moron leaves the keys in the ignition? When I put the keys in my pocket, it distracts from my natural bulge.
 <br>
 God! You guys, I&#39;ve been thinking about Steven and Michael all day and I don&#39;t know who to pick.
 <br>
 Face facts, Jackie.
 <br>
 There&#39;s only one good man in this town and, well, he&#39;s leaving.
 <br>
 Eric, this is really hard.
 <br>
 I mean, okay.
 <br>
 I know I love Steven because he&#39;s smart, and he&#39;s deep and when we have conversation he makes me think.
 <br>
 Which used to give me a headache, but now I really like.
 <br>
 - So, go with Hyde.
 <br>
 - Yeah, but Michael.
 <br>
 Oh, Michael is so beautiful.
 <br>
 And you spend a lot more time looking at someone than you do talking to them.
 <br>
 Again, go with Hyde.
 <br>
 No, but, Donna, you don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 Look, I know in a lot of ways I need Steven.
 <br>
 But Michael needs me.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s nice to be needed.
 <br>
 You know what, Jackie? In order to help you, and- well, just to speed this thing up- I, uh- I think you should just take everything and toss it aside and ask yourself, who do you love the most? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I should do- - Because I&#39;m- - No, no.
 <br>
 Not here.
 <br>
 Not here.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s-Yeah, just- More dishes? I thought we already loaded these.
 <br>
 You had to bring the Millennium Falcon? Son, here&#39;s 10 bucks for gas.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Well, I just want to make sure that you get out.
 <br>
 I mean, that you get, um, all the way there.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, I made a decision.
 <br>
 So who&#39;s it gonna be? &#34;Tall and hot&#34; or &#34;short and kosher&#34;? Would you shut the hell up and let her talk? Okay, look.
 <br>
 I had to ask myself a really hard question.
 <br>
 Who do I love most? And the answer was so obvious.
 <br>
 It was staring me in the face the whole time.
 <br>
 The person I love most is me.
 <br>
 I love me most.
 <br>
 You choose you? Look, if I could run across the beach into my own arms, I would.
 <br>
 Wait, what- So where does that leave us? I&#39;ll figure that out after I spend the summer by the pool.
 <br>
 I feel this would be a lot clearer when I&#39;m much tanner.
 <br>
 What a bunch of crap, man.
 <br>
 You know, freakin&#39; girls.
 <br>
 If it wasn&#39;t for the soft skin, the legs the eyes, the long fingernails, the butts and the boobs, I wouldn&#39;t even talk to &#39;em.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Picture time.
 <br>
 Everybody get in front of the car.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman, I got you a plant for your new apartment - but, um, I can&#39;t give it to you in front of your parents.
 <br>
 - Oh! Okay, here we go.
 <br>
 One, two- - Guys, I have something to tell you.
 <br>
 - Just talk while you pose.
 <br>
 Kitty, be sure to get me in the background loadin&#39; the last bunch of Eric&#39;s crap.
 <br>
 - Aw, man.
 <br>
 - Okay, here we go.
 <br>
 Smile.
 <br>
 [Flashbulb Pops] Okay, tell them Laurie.
 <br>
 I married Fez so he could stay in the country! [Flashbulbs Pop] You did what? Don&#39;t worry, Daddy.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t love him.
 <br>
 I was just bored.
 <br>
 Yeah, but we will be sleeping together.
 <br>
 You- Ooh.
 <br>
 Ooh.
 <br>
 - Dad, are you all right? - Uh, yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just, uh- My arm hurts.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Red, you&#39;re all clammy.
 <br>
 Red, I think you&#39;re having a heart attack.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Open your eyes.
 <br>
 He&#39;s having an arm attack.
 <br>
 - Michael- Michael, get a chair.
 <br>
 Laurie, call an ambulance.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Hang in there, Dad.
 <br>
 - Kitty? - Yes, Red? If I don&#39;t make it kill the foreigner.
 <br>
 So, Red&#39;s gonna be okay, huh? Yeah, he&#39;s doing better, but they&#39;re gonna be at the hospital for a while.
 <br>
 - Hey, you got the letter for your folks? - Yes.
 <br>
 I told them I&#39;m married, and I&#39;m not coming home.
 <br>
 And that people have landed on the great white head.
 <br>
 [Splashing] Yeah, that&#39;ll get there.
 <br>
 <br>
