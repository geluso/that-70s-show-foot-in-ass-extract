<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So, Mr.
 <br>
 Hammond said it was fine for me to miss class &#39;cause I&#39;m already getting an &#39;&#39;A.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; So just as you suspected, Mom I am better than everybody.
 <br>
 All I know is, my little boy was very brave at the dentist today.
 <br>
 Wasn&#39;t he? Yes, he was, my &#39;&#39;wittle snicklefwitz.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughing ) Okay, Mom, uh, when a boy reaches a certain age the baby voice no longer comforts him.
 <br>
 It urges him to kill.
 <br>
 - Shh! Shh! - Okay, let&#39;s, uh, get you some coffee.
 <br>
 Nobody pukes in the Trans Am.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Uh-oh, you look mad.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) What did Eric do? Bad Eric! Donna? Why aren&#39;t you in school? No worries.
 <br>
 I called her in sick.
 <br>
 I told &#39;em &#39;&#39;lady troubles.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; No questions asked.
 <br>
 Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Easy there, wobbles.
 <br>
 Have you been drinking? I hope so.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause if not, this whole place is a-spinnin&#39;! Hang on, boys, it&#39;s a twister! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! So, my mom and I were at The Hub getting ice cream and we caught Donna with Casey skipping school.
 <br>
 And she was drunk, in the middle of the afternoon.
 <br>
 It was like- It was like Sue Ellen on Dallas.
 <br>
 You went to The Hub for ice cream with your mommy? ( Chuckles ) Why would you tell me that? Hyde, the point is, he went for ice cream without us.
 <br>
 You cannot pick up a phone? You know who can&#39;t pick up a phone? Jackie.
 <br>
 I broke up with her and she never calls to even say hi or to offer me sad, but hot break-up sex.
 <br>
 I mean, that&#39;s just selfish.
 <br>
 Guys, my mom&#39;s over at the Pinciottis&#39; right now telling Bob about Donna being drunk.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t do that kind of stuff in the middle of the afternoon.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll mess with your-your-your- your-your-your- thinking thing.
 <br>
 You know what I&#39;m saying.
 <br>
 Yeah, you got to stay sharp, man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I keep myself pure until 3:00.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I keep myself pure until 2:00.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) I&#39;m not wearing a watch.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what? Donna getting busted is actually great for me because now she&#39;s got to realize what a jackass Casey is.
 <br>
 And when she dumps him I&#39;ll be standin&#39; right here with open arms and a gentle &#39;&#39;I told you so.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, yeah, that could happen.
 <br>
 After all, I mean I made that girl a woman.
 <br>
 I madeJackie a woman like, a thousand times.
 <br>
 We stole dead fish.
 <br>
 Dead fish? What are you going to do with dead fish? You&#39;re missing the point, man! We stole dead fish! Ah, you just don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - I just came by- - I miss you.
 <br>
 - What? - What? - Did you say you missed me? - No.
 <br>
 - Look,just say you miss me.
 <br>
 - Fine, I miss you! Michael, I miss you too.
 <br>
 And look, I was thinking, since we broke up because I kissed another guy what if I let you kiss another girl? I mean, we would be even, and we could get back together.
 <br>
 Jackie, if you think that me kissin&#39; another girl is going to bring us closer together I&#39;m totally willing to make that sacrifice.
 <br>
 Thank you, Michael.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I better go wash my face.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Ah, this fish is so stinky.
 <br>
 What the hell are we going to do with the stinky? It&#39;s simple, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna find a place to hide the stinky and ruin someone&#39;s day.
 <br>
 Now, question is: where, how and who? ( Angelic Choir ) The answer is: there, that and Kelso.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s like a bowl- a bowl for the stinky.
 <br>
 And we will put it, and he&#39;ll never find it, and it will smell forever! What the hell&#39;s going on with you? You&#39;re grounded! No arguments! Dad, I&#39;m not grounded.
 <br>
 Okay, well, then, whatever you think is best.
 <br>
 No, not whatever she thinks is best.
 <br>
 You are grounded.
 <br>
 Hey, you&#39;re not my mother.
 <br>
 You have no say in what I do.
 <br>
 Well, she&#39;s got you there.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 Which chick do I want to kiss? Oh, no, no, no, Michael.
 <br>
 I get to pick the girl.
 <br>
 But you&#39;ll pick an &#39;&#39;uggo.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; You didn&#39;t call &#39;&#39;no uggos.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Hey, I just thought of something.
 <br>
 Your plan&#39;s good and all, but what if the girl that you pick doesn&#39;t want to kiss me? &#39;&#39;Doesn&#39;t want to kiss me&#39;&#39;! And then I told Donna she was grounded, and she said no.
 <br>
 She said no? Can you do that? No.
 <br>
 I need your help, Red.
 <br>
 I gotta get Donna away from that guy.
 <br>
 Oh, Dad, you know what&#39;s good? Threaten her with the old foot in the ass.
 <br>
 You know, that Casey.
 <br>
 How can such a bad influence live in such a handsome package? Bad people should have a- a big scar or an eye patch so you can recognize them.
 <br>
 The problem is you know, there&#39;s a point when your kids realize you can&#39;t do nothin&#39; to control them.
 <br>
 There is? No.
 <br>
 Now stop listening.
 <br>
 Bob, I don&#39;t want to get involved.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got enough problems with the 1 4 kids who think they live here now.
 <br>
 Why do I have to hold the fish? Because that&#39;s what the little buddy does.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh! Someone&#39;s coming.
 <br>
 So the guy&#39;s trying to tell me that his Z28 is the same car as my Trans Am except for the decals.
 <br>
 How can people be so ignorant? I see you, Donna! I see you! - Dad.
 <br>
 ! - Don&#39;t &#39;&#39;Dad&#39;&#39; me! You&#39;re not going anywhere, not with this guy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re grounded again.
 <br>
 - How much did we miss? - Shh!Just started.
 <br>
 Dad, I&#39;m gonna do whatever I want with whoever I want whenever I want to do it! We have to have a talk right now, Donna.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, sir, let me just say that you&#39;re making a lot of sense here and I think that when I bring Donna home tonight you two ought to sit down and really hammer this thing out.
 <br>
 - Okay, that sounds fair.
 <br>
 - ( All Groaning ) What? - You&#39;re just gonna let her go off with him? - What else can I do? Oh, good God, that&#39;s it! Everybody in the living room.
 <br>
 Now! Not you.
 <br>
 Bob, get in here! Donna, what has gotten into you? Skipping school, showing no respect for your father.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 - Shut up, Bob.
 <br>
 Okay, here&#39;s snacks.
 <br>
 So, um, anybody need a drink? I&#39;ll take a rum and Coke for the road.
 <br>
 Hey, hey, buddy, little tip? I think booze is what got you in trouble in the first place.
 <br>
 How could you take this girl out drinking in the middle of the day? Well, you know how it is.
 <br>
 All the older girls were at work.
 <br>
 Can I just say this guy is not boyfriend material.
 <br>
 I agree.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not going out with him anymore.
 <br>
 You two are done.
 <br>
 - No! - All right.
 <br>
 - What? - You got to admit this has been a real hassle.
 <br>
 I mean, it was fun and you&#39;re a great girl but let&#39;s just call it a day.
 <br>
 Wait, you&#39;re breaking up with her? Casey, I thought you said you- -you know, you said you loved me.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I have this thing where I say stuff I don&#39;t really mean.
 <br>
 - Casey- - Look, Donna I see what you&#39;re gettin&#39; at, and I&#39;m not that type of guy.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, what say we rain check that rum and Coke? Donna, I&#39;m- I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not sorry.
 <br>
 You got exactly what you wanted.
 <br>
 - Ow! - Ohh! Eric, someone here to see you.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Can I get anyone a snack? - Mom.
 <br>
 - Right, right.
 <br>
 Have to stop doing that.
 <br>
 So, um, how are you? Humiliated.
 <br>
 I&#39;m such an idiot.
 <br>
 I got dumped in front of the whole world.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t even know what I said to your mom at The Hub and I hate that she saw me like that.
 <br>
 What is wrong with me? Hey, nothing.
 <br>
 Look, your mom left.
 <br>
 Come on, you&#39;re- you&#39;re allowed to freak out.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Everybody warned me about Casey, and I fell for him anyway.
 <br>
 And he&#39;s such a jackass.
 <br>
 You know, I really, really wanted you to figure that out,just not like this.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m just- - ( Sniffles ) I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 I was so stupid.
 <br>
 - Eric, we should be together.
 <br>
 - Wait, what? Let&#39;s just, like, forget all this other stuff happened.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Donna, I mean if you come running back to me now I- Donna, I can&#39;t be your second choice.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh, where am I? ( Door Closes ) Mmm.
 <br>
 How about I kiss her? No way.
 <br>
 She&#39;s too tall, too tan, too rich.
 <br>
 Damn,Jackie, I don&#39;t want to kiss a short, pale, poor girl.
 <br>
 Okay, look, Michael, all I know is I don&#39;t want to stay broken up.
 <br>
 Oh! Okay, you know what, you choose.
 <br>
 Kiss any girl you want.
 <br>
 I choose you.
 <br>
 Michael, that is the most romantic thing I&#39;ve ever read, heard about or seen on TV.
 <br>
 Yeah, it was pretty romantic.
 <br>
 I could tell while I was doing it.
 <br>
 - Oh, God.
 <br>
 - What? No, it&#39;s just- Look, one week you break up with me, and the next week you&#39;re Prince Charming? I&#39;m an incredibly complex man,Jackie.
 <br>
 Michael, I can&#39;t do this anymore.
 <br>
 Look, Michael, if you want to choose me, then choose me.
 <br>
 I mean, really choose me.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get married.
 <br>
 What? Michael, all our problems are because we haven&#39;t decided we&#39;re gonna be together forever.
 <br>
 So let&#39;s decide.
 <br>
 Hold on.
 <br>
 You want to get married? Yes, Michael! Yes, I accept! Oh! Oh, my God! You know what? I gotta go tell my dad.
 <br>
 And you-you have to buy a ring.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Just think about it: We are going to be the Burkhart-Kelsos! The Who-hart What-os? ( Squeals ) Michael and I are getting married! Yeah, we heard.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why we&#39;re decorating the van.
 <br>
 But- But not with fish.
 <br>
 Ow! Let me get this straight.
 <br>
 Donna wanted to get back together and you said no? I said no.
 <br>
 You said no? Dumb-ass! Look, I have my reasons, okay? What could they be? What could they possibly be? Casey dumps her and she comes to me? Okay, I&#39;m not a rebound.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re too proud to take her back? And what do you have to be so proud of? You&#39;re not an athlete.
 <br>
 The only smart thing about you is your mouth.
 <br>
 And look at you.
 <br>
 Red- Red, he looks fine.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just so darn stupid! I&#39;m- I&#39;m very upset.
 <br>
 ! Well, stop, okay? Because, I already feel bad enough as it is.
 <br>
 - Well, you should.
 <br>
 - Well, I do! I love her.
 <br>
 God, why do I always have to screw these things up, you know? Why does everything always have to be my way? That&#39;s why we broke up in the first place.
 <br>
 Uh-huh, well, we&#39;ve all known that for a year! Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, I have to tell Donna how I feel.
 <br>
 Then go! Oh, Red.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 We&#39;re never gonna get him out of the house.
 <br>
 Donna? Oh, hello, Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, Mrs.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m sorry,Joanne.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know your last name.
 <br>
 I have something to tell you guys.
 <br>
 I love Donna.
 <br>
 Well, she isn&#39;t here.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t know where she is.
 <br>
 And-And it&#39;s Stupak.
 <br>
 Well, uh, if it&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll just wait.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 I always liked you.
 <br>
 Oh, thank you, sir.
 <br>
 But do me a favor.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t play with her undergarments.
 <br>
 Somethin&#39; reeks! Man! - Where are you goin&#39;? - Bus station.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to my mom&#39;s in California.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re runnin&#39; away.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what else to do.
 <br>
 No, I know how you feel.
 <br>
 Jackie wants to get married.
 <br>
 To me! What? Look, a lot of people don&#39;t know this about us, butJackie&#39;s pretty much in charge.
 <br>
 So it might happen.
 <br>
 But it won&#39;t happen if I&#39;m not here.
 <br>
 You know what, I&#39;ll drive you.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll both go to California.
 <br>
 Kelso, are you up for this? Hey, if the Beverly Hillbillies can do it, so can I.
 <br>
 Great, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 What stinks? This town, baby.
 <br>
 - ( Engine Starts ) - We&#39;re leaving that smell behind.
 <br>
 Whew! ( Soft Rock ) ( Bluegrass ) Kelso! I&#39;m not gonna tell you again! Well, I was reaching for my soda.
 <br>
 Damn! Man, Iowa smells like fish too.
 <br>
 Should have taken the bus.
 <br>
