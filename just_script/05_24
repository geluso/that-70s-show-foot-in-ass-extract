<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Okay, Eric.
 <br>
 Get a good look at me in my uniform.
 <br>
 Because today- It&#39;s my last day wearing it.
 <br>
 What? No.
 <br>
 No! Ah! We never got to do the trampoline thing.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m done with Catholic school.
 <br>
 And my dad fixed it so I can graduate at Point Place with you guys.
 <br>
 My best memories are under that skirt.
 <br>
 Hey, Mom? Where&#39;s Daddy? I need $20.
 <br>
 - For what? - In an effort to clean up my act I&#39;m buying my own drinks now.
 <br>
 Well, he&#39;s not home.
 <br>
 When Eric told him about his little plan to move away with Donna after graduation your father went fishing.
 <br>
 - What? - No! What the big deal? You guys are really freakin&#39; me out.
 <br>
 My dad only goes fishing when he&#39;s, like, super-pissed.
 <br>
 I think something about stabbing a worm over and over again with a hook is, like um, therapeutic for him.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 He fished for three whole days when he found out about me and the mayor.
 <br>
 - What? - Eric&#39;s moving away! That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s why your father&#39;s angry.
 <br>
 This is your way of acting grown up? Grown-ups don&#39;t just leave the comfort of their parents&#39; home to- to move to a new city and start a life? Well, maybe not in the 1930s- &#39;40s- God, you&#39;re so young.
 <br>
 Well, I think this is nuts.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you just think this is nuts? - The whole thing is just-just nuts! - [Utensils Clattering] Mom, I kinda think you&#39;re the one who&#39;s being- Oh, if you say I&#39;m nuts, you&#39;re going right through that sliding door.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t enjoy telling you this but you just wait until your father gets home.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I did enjoy that.
 <br>
 This is all your fault.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, Laurie, uh, quick impression: Who am I? &#34;Hey, Eric, why don&#39;t you tell Dad you&#39;re moving after graduation so he&#39;ll kill you and I can reclaim my rightful place as the chosen one?&#34; [Mouths Word] Eric, you don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 This time I actually meant well.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what you said at the county fair after you locked me in the Porta-Potty with a goat.
 <br>
 - He was friendly.
 <br>
 - He was horny! - Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 - [Groans] - Michael, what do you want? - I think the question is, what do you want? And I&#39;m pretty sure the answer is pink jelly beans.
 <br>
 Now, they used to be pink and white jelly beans, but I ate all the white ones &#39;cause I know you don&#39;t like things that taste white.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Michael, just because Steven and I broke up does not mean I want you throwing yourself at me.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Jackie, this is the new and improved Michael.
 <br>
 Okay? I&#39;m not throwing anything at you except for happy thoughts and jelly beans.
 <br>
 Like, sex is, like, the furthest thing from my mind.
 <br>
 So- [Sighs] It&#39;s really over between you two, huh? Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, I think it is.
 <br>
 - So why do we still have clothes on? - Oh, God.
 <br>
 Michael, get out! Oh, Jackie, I&#39;m talking about our emotional clothes.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I know I&#39;ve made mistakes in the past, okay? But I&#39;ve changed, and I just want you to get to know the new me.
 <br>
 Yeah, the new you, huh? What does the new you cheat with- every skank who throws her fat, furry butt at you? Jackie, no one I ever cheated with had a fat, furry butt! If anything, it was one or the other.
 <br>
 But look, all that is over, okay? It&#39;s finito, the end-o.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t believe you.
 <br>
 - Well, it&#39;s the truth.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Michael, whatever.
 <br>
 - Okay? Let&#39;s just see how things go from here.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get naked.
 <br>
 - Oh! Michael! - No, like, friendly naked- like two girls in a sauna.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] You are such a freak.
 <br>
 Okay, look, just-At least take a jelly bean? Okay? I bought &#39;em just for you.
 <br>
 Well, that was very sweet.
 <br>
 There you are.
 <br>
 Give me back my jelly beans, you son of a bitch! ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] Okay, now cross and uncross your legs.
 <br>
 Um- Hmm- Hmm, okay, now make a face like- like, &#34;Oops, did I do something bad?&#34; [Shutter Clicking] Okay, now-now crawl to me.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Now crawl away from me.
 <br>
 Ooh, sexy.
 <br>
 Come on, Donna.
 <br>
 Throw him a bone, huh? There&#39;s only so much satisfaction the kid can get from the back of a panty hose package.
 <br>
 Yes, Donna.
 <br>
 I have a lot to do.
 <br>
 After this I have to get Lindsay Wolfe to sign my yearbook then show her that she&#39;s actually signed a pledge to do it with me three times.
 <br>
 Why three? Well, because the first time I&#39;ll be nervous and then the second time I&#39;ll have to please her because I got nervous.
 <br>
 But then the third time- the third time is when I get funky.
 <br>
 - Jackie- - No, no.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;m not here to see you.
 <br>
 Okay? I&#39;m just here to see Donna.
 <br>
 Look, I told you I&#39;m sorry, and I made a mistake.
 <br>
 Can we just talk, please? Talk about what? You cheated on me.
 <br>
 Okay? It&#39;s over.
 <br>
 I feel nothing.
 <br>
 Ooh, bitchy.
 <br>
 You know what? Donna, I&#39;ll just see you next door.
 <br>
 - [Clatters] - Ouch! - Are you okay? Fez! Panties! Panties! - [Strains] - Ah.
 <br>
 The sacred senior prank where we vandalize the water tower.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment since well, the last time we vandalized the water tower.
 <br>
 So, Hyde gaveJackie some jelly beans today.
 <br>
 - Who cares? - Yeah, well, you should, because they were pink and that is the bean of love.
 <br>
 And I got her that particular bean because I never stopped loving her.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you stopped long enough to cheat on her with Pam Macy, Laurie and Annette.
 <br>
 - Who else am I forgetting? - [Chortles] There were many others.
 <br>
 But you cheated on her with a nurse.
 <br>
 It was a misunderstanding that you caused.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah? I&#39;m ready.
 <br>
 I hope you got that nurse&#39;s number.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna need it when I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 Hey, stop it.
 <br>
 Stop it.
 <br>
 You two need to grow up and start painting genitals on the water tower.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be over here.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be over here.
 <br>
 Well, since I have never seen another man&#39;s genitals, I&#39;ll have to paint my own.
 <br>
 In that case, I&#39;ll need more paint.
 <br>
 [Laughs] And a bigger tower.
 <br>
 [Laughs] - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
 <br>
 - Kelso, what are you writing? - &#34;Michael plus Jackie.
 <br>
 &#34; - I&#39;m kickin&#39; your ass! Ah, you can&#39;t kick my ass from down there.
 <br>
 All you can do is punch my ass.
 <br>
 - Hey, get down! - Just face the fact, Hyde.
 <br>
 You&#39;re down there and I&#39;m up here, and I am invincible.
 <br>
 [Branches Snapping] - [Body Crashes Into Shrubbery] - Kelso, are you okay? I think I fell! - I&#39;m gonna go check on him.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, I think he&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 Where do I begin? I want it to look like it&#39;s coming right at me.
 <br>
 [Siren Blares] [Man On P.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 ] This is the Point Place Police Department.
 <br>
 You&#39;re under arrest! Um, I am a painter from a foreign country and this is my gift to America.
 <br>
 Get off the water tower! People of America I give you Genitals in the Sky.
 <br>
 [Vehicle Approaching] - [Brakes Squeak] - You hear that? - [Engine Stops] - Sounded like your dad&#39;s car.
 <br>
 - [Door Opens] - Run for it.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 You made your bed.
 <br>
 Now you have to lie in it.
 <br>
 Oh, who am I kidding? You never make your bed.
 <br>
 Eric, wait.
 <br>
 Listen.
 <br>
 If you leave now, you&#39;ll never get back in.
 <br>
 - That means good-bye to your clothes, your furniture- - [Gasps] My G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joes.
 <br>
 We stay.
 <br>
 Everybody in the living room.
 <br>
 [Inhales, Singsongy] You&#39;re gonna get it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna get it.
 <br>
 Lay it on him, Red.
 <br>
 [Sighs] While I was fishing, I had a lotta time to think.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 - And all that thinking made me very angry.
 <br>
 Very angry.
 <br>
 And the fish that were unlucky enough to cross my path- Well, you know how they say that fish can&#39;t feel pain? That&#39;s a load of crap.
 <br>
 A big load.
 <br>
 And I finally came to a conclusion that someone in this room is not going to like.
 <br>
 That&#39;s you, porky mouth.
 <br>
 Eric - I&#39;m proud of you.
 <br>
 - And that goes double for- What the hell did you say? I did everything I could to stop you from getting married but you stuck to your guns.
 <br>
 And I admire that you&#39;re willing to go out on your own.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a man now, and you have my blessing.
 <br>
 This is like The Godfather.
 <br>
 I think you have to kiss his ring.
 <br>
 How can you just give in and let Eric leave home? He has defied you over and over.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a- a lying, cheating, conniving liar and I won&#39;t let you send my precious baby boy away.
 <br>
 Kitty, my mind is made up.
 <br>
 And, Eric, we&#39;re gonna pay for your college too.
 <br>
 Really? Dad, l-I don&#39;t know what to say to you, except you&#39;re great! That&#39;s all right, Son.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t do that here.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well.
 <br>
 Well, this is nice.
 <br>
 Since we&#39;re all happy, Eric doesn&#39;t have to leave three months early.
 <br>
 He can go to school in the fall like everyone else.
 <br>
 We can take a pottery class! No, Kitty, he&#39;s leaving: No pottery class, no mother-son dancing lessons no trying out for Family Feud.
 <br>
 But this deal is only good if you stay focused.
 <br>
 If you do something stupid- like get Donna pregnant- you&#39;re on your own.
 <br>
 Then I guess this is a bad time to give you the news.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kidding! I&#39;m just so giddy! - So it&#39;s just a sprain, huh? - Yeah, it doesn&#39;t hurt too bad.
 <br>
 [Door Closes] I guess the best part is I&#39;ve now fallen off the water tower in every grade.
 <br>
 That record will stand until your son goes to school.
 <br>
 - Thanks for drivin&#39; me to the hospital, man.
 <br>
 - Oh, whatever.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Not &#34;whatever.
 <br>
 &#34; I mean, look.
 <br>
 You drove me because we&#39;ve been buds forever.
 <br>
 L- It&#39;s like, why are we fightin&#39; over a girl, man? Remember in third grade when we were both in love with Miss Hamill and we fought over her? And then after you pulled my head out of the toilet, and I let go of your bean bags we made a pact to never fight over a girl again.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;re right, man.
 <br>
 I mean, neither of us has a shot with Jackie anyway.
 <br>
 - So I&#39;m steppin&#39; back.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 You go for it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll step back.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 Door&#39;s open for you.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 The door is open for you.
 <br>
 - I just closed the door for me! - Well, I&#39;m closin&#39; the door for me and I&#39;m lockin&#39; myself inside, and I&#39;m swallowin&#39; the key! Fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;re both done with her.
 <br>
 You&#39;re my bud.
 <br>
 You&#39;re my bud.
 <br>
 Aah! I was wondering if that would work, and it did.
 <br>
 - [Gasps] Steven! Are you okay? - Why? Well, I heard someone fell off the water tower, and I thought it could be you.
 <br>
 L- - No, it was Kelso.
 <br>
 - [Exhales] Wait.
 <br>
 You came down here, &#39;cause you were worried about me.
 <br>
 No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you still care about me.
 <br>
 Uh-uh.
 <br>
 - So I still have a shot with you.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 I mean, okay.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Steven, stop staring at me, or I&#39;ll kick you.
 <br>
 Ah! Jackie, hope you didn&#39;t come here to make love to me.
 <br>
 - No, Michael.
 <br>
 L- - &#39;Cause I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 All I need is my buddy Hyde.
 <br>
 And no chick is gonna come between us anymore.
 <br>
 - Right, Hyde? - Uh-h-h, yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go, buddy Hyde.
 <br>
 Aah! Look at all the apartments they have in Madison.
 <br>
 - This place even pays utilities.
 <br>
 - Oh, cool.
 <br>
 What are utilities? - I think it&#39;s, like, gas and water.
 <br>
 - Free water? Um, you know what that means? Free ice.
 <br>
 What are you two doing? Oh, we&#39;re lookin&#39; for apartments in Madison.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we leave in less than a week.
 <br>
 Are you trying to kill me? Because that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.
 <br>
 You&#39;re killing your mother.
 <br>
 You only get one, ya know.
 <br>
 Eric, this place has a washer and dryer.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 A washer and free water? - Oh, my God, it&#39;s like there&#39;s no reason to ever come home.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 [Laughs, Stops] Excuse me.
 <br>
 Washer and dryer, Red.
 <br>
 They are going to have a washer and dryer.
 <br>
 That redheaded harlot is gonna be Shouting out my baby&#39;s grass stains! What about my last summer with my youngest child? I bet you weren&#39;t thinkin&#39; about that when you went fishing.
 <br>
 I bought sparklers for the Fourth ofJuly.
 <br>
 He loves sparklers and now he&#39;s leaving, and what are we gonna do for the Fourth ofJuly? Uh-h-h, there&#39;s a car show in Kenosha.
 <br>
 A car show? I don&#39;t want to go to a- [Bleeps] car show in- [Bleeps] Kenosha.
 <br>
 I want three more- [Bleeps] months with my baby boy and now they&#39;re gone because of your bull- [Bleeps] Way to go, dumb-ass! Ah, it feels good to be back! Just Kelso and Hyde.
 <br>
 No chick can come between us.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 So what do ya wanna do? We can play air hockey, give Fez a wedgie, uh- Oh, my brother just got a new stereo.
 <br>
 We can throw it off an overpass.
 <br>
 Actually, I changed my mind.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna getJackie back.
 <br>
 What? No way.
 <br>
 What about our third-grade pact? We also made a pact to invent a formula for invisibility.
 <br>
 - Well, that fell through too.
 <br>
 - Well, because you gave up.
 <br>
 Look, Kelso.
 <br>
 I never felt this way about a girl before, okay? And that pretty much beats our third-grade pact.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, but I wanna be with her.
 <br>
 Well, at the hospital, you said that I could have her.
 <br>
 That was when I didn&#39;t think I still had a shot with her.
 <br>
 Your- For your information, I still have a shot with her.
 <br>
 She accepted my jelly beans.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what that means, but you can&#39;t have her.
 <br>
 You closed the door.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, now I&#39;m closin&#39; the door on you, and once again, I&#39;m swallowin&#39; the key.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re locked inside, and I&#39;m gettin&#39;Jackie back.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re gonna lose.
 <br>
 Heh-heh.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, if by &#34;lose&#34; you mean &#34;win,&#34; then you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I am gonna lose.
 <br>
 [Chortles] Well, thanks a lot for getting me at the police station, you two sons of two bitches! Fez, what happened? Well, I got arrested.
 <br>
 And they did a background check and found out that my student visa expires when I graduate from high school.
 <br>
 - What? - Yeah, and now I have to leave the country after graduation.
 <br>
 That&#39;s in a week.
 <br>
 And I have to relearn my native language.
 <br>
 - Good day.
 <br>
 - No, but Fez- [Speaking Foreign Language] Way to go.
 <br>
 If you hadn&#39;t fallen off the water tower, we could&#39;ve helped him out.
 <br>
 Aah! Aa-aa-aah! They should&#39;ve x-rayed your head at the hospital.
 <br>
 They did.
 <br>
 And for your information, they found nothing.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe our little Fez is gonna be deported.
 <br>
 God, I wish there was something we could do.
 <br>
 Maybe I could talk to the mayor.
 <br>
 He owes me one.
 <br>
 Eric, we can&#39;t let this happen.
 <br>
 If Fez goes back to his country with those pictures he took my panties are gonna end up on a stamp.
 <br>
 Pop-Tarts? Where&#39;s Mom? She went fishin&#39;.
 <br>
 Shut up and eat.
 <br>
 Dear PresidentJimmy Carter.
 <br>
 The following is a list of reasons why I, Fez, should be allowed to stay in your great country.
 <br>
 Number one: I have never gone number one on your beautiful soil.
 <br>
 Number two: I have never gone number two on your- Wait.
 <br>
 Scratch that.
 <br>
 Number two: &#34;Fez&#34; is also a word for a hat.
 <br>
 Uncle Sam wears a hat.
 <br>
 Coincidence? [Chuckles] Yes.
 <br>
 Three, where else am I going to live? France? [Scoffs] [Bleeps] France.
 <br>
