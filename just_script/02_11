<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So uhm, Laurie is almost all packed.
 <br>
 I cant believe my little girl is moving out.
 <br>
 Which reminds me, when are you leaving? NEVER! Cause I LOVE it here! Right.
 <br>
 Kitty, do you really think this is a good idea? I mean it might be a little soon for her to be on her own.
 <br>
 Red, shes gonna be fine, shes gonna split rent with a girlfriend.
 <br>
 She doesnt even have a job! Well she is gonna get a job! Oh, that reminds me, can I have her room? No, I already gave it to Stephen.
 <br>
 But Im your son! Daddy? Man , would you look at this place? Its kinda girlie.
 <br>
 Its a girls room Hyde.
 <br>
 Oh, so all those guys, they were just passing through? Well, thats over.
 <br>
 Welcome to Hydeville baby! You know, if I cared about this dump at all, that would totally creep me out.
 <br>
 Come on Laurie, youre gonna miss your room.
 <br>
 Its not like you have no feelings.
 <br>
 Ever.
 <br>
 About anything.
 <br>
 YES! Im so psyched! Owww, did you finally figure out how a thermos works? Noooo, Im psyched about your new place you know.
 <br>
 Cause whenever we fool around here Im always afraid that Jackies gonna catch us.
 <br>
 And I dont wanna hurt her, cause I love her.
 <br>
 So this is great, it solves everything.
 <br>
 Kelso, you are not allowed anywhere near my new place.
 <br>
 EVER! Laurie You know what, you freaks, you got about two minutes to deal with this little drama here, then get the hell out of my room! Wow, I see whats going on here, youre breaking up with me.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 For me to break up with you, there would have to be something between us to break.
 <br>
 OHHH! I cannot believe that youre being SUCH a Bitch? Duhhh! Look Kelso, it was fun, and sweaty and all, but youre just a guy I fooled around with when there was nothing good on TV.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Well, maybe there wont be anything good on TV at your new place! Oh DAMN there is always something good on TV! Hey Kelso, look whos here! Its Jackie! Hi Jackie! God Laurie, I cant believe youre moving! I know we didnt spend much time together, but I think some of my good taste was rubbing off on you.
 <br>
 And Im so happy for that! Thanks Jackie! Im gonna miss you too! Oh Kelso, I almost forgot, I found a t-shirt of you when I was cleaning out my room Say.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 how did that get there? Thats funny, this isnt even mine! Yeah I know, this must be Erics shirt.
 <br>
 Your mom sewed your name in it Michael! MAN, Erics gonna be pissed huh! Jackie see, I borrowed Erics shirt cause mine wasnt working right.
 <br>
 And uh then my mom must have sewed my name in it.
 <br>
 Hm, I dont know Michael.
 <br>
 What, do you think Im lying? Jackie, if I were lying, Id come up with a lot better lie then that.
 <br>
 Yeah, youd think so! So Laurie is definitely moving out? And its definitely over with her and Kelso? Well, she is moving all the way across town, I mean, she is slutty but.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I mean she hates to commute.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Good, because Kelso is a rat-bastard and Im not covering for him.
 <br>
 Donna relax, its over.
 <br>
 So now you can get back to pleasing your man.
 <br>
 Eric please leave.
 <br>
 I have to talk to Donna alone.
 <br>
 Well okay, cause I mean, its not like this is my home or any ERIC! Jackie, you have something you wanna ask me? See, Im kinda worried about Michael and Laurie.
 <br>
 I mean, she found his t-shirt in her room, and he said it wasnt his even though it had his name in it.
 <br>
 And at that time I believed him.
 <br>
 But now I cant remember why.
 <br>
 But if there is something going on, I think I wanna know.
 <br>
 But I dont wanna know.
 <br>
 That even if I wanna know, you know? Im supposed to say? Donna, youre supposed to say that there is nothing going on, that Michael loves me and were together and thats all that matters.
 <br>
 That sounds good.
 <br>
 GOD youre so NAIVE! Isnt there like someone else you could talk to about this? Yeah well, I used to have this penpal in Nicaragua, but she just stopped writing after that hurricane-thingy Your new room is very pretty.
 <br>
 Like a flower, or a girl.
 <br>
 You know, people might see this room and think you are a gay.
 <br>
 I dont think so Fez.
 <br>
 Oh Hyde, you would be surprised how easily people can make that mistake.
 <br>
 Hey Hyde, thanks for your help with Jackie man.
 <br>
 Sure thing man.
 <br>
 Okay Hyde, do you know what sarcasm is? No.
 <br>
 Hyde man, you almost got me caught! I almost got you caught? My mom sewed my name in Erics shirt ? Youre so lame man.
 <br>
 You know, half the time you act like you want me to get caught.
 <br>
 Kelso, youre my friend, I dont want you to get caught, cause if you get caught then my fun is over.
 <br>
 So Im just trying to prolong your suffering.
 <br>
 Well okay, thats a little better.
 <br>
 Allright, friends for life baby! Well Stephen is getting all settled in.
 <br>
 He better not change anything, I dont want him messing with my little girls room.
 <br>
 You know how he is, messy, dirty, foul.
 <br>
 What if she has to move back home? Oh Red, she is gonna be fine.
 <br>
 I know Kitty, you think that she is all grown up, but there is still a lot that she doesnt know.
 <br>
 I mean what if her place doesnt have a deadbolt? Or smoke-detector? Red, you dont have to baby her, shes twenty! Youre never too old to burn to death in a fire! Well would you look at this, she found a place in a nice neighbourhood.
 <br>
 Aint she something Well I hope she hasnt had breakfast yet.
 <br>
 Or a fire.
 <br>
 Can I help you? Duhhh.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 no we got the wrong appartment I guess.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 MAN: Not a problem.
 <br>
 No wait, is Laurie there? MAN: Oh yeah, hold on a second Honey? Hi Daddy! go to hell!! Honey, whats wrong? What&#39;s wrong ? Everyhting is wrong! Damn kids today, they wouldnt know responsibility if it walked up and bit m in the ass! Get a job, phah, its just party all night, dance all day, and sex everywhere in between! Sydney! Laurie is living with a boy? Yes.
 <br>
 Just one boy right? Yeah I think so.
 <br>
 Now see, it could have been worse.
 <br>
 Lauries busted! This is, and I dont think Im exaggerating here, the greatest day in the history of time.
 <br>
 Except maybe the day cheese was invented.
 <br>
 I love the cheese! Wow man, shes gone one day, and shes already got a new guy.
 <br>
 Kelso you heartbreaker you Im having a horrible day.
 <br>
 Lauries gone and Jackie is all suspicious of me, and Im getting no lovin.
 <br>
 None! I cant be me without lovin.
 <br>
 Kelso, if you wanna keep Jackie man, and trust me, you dont, you gotta act innocent okay, lets practice.
 <br>
 So, did you fool around with Laurie? You know I did! Dumbass NO MAN! Complete denial! Watergate! Learn! Did you fool around with Laurie? Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean NO, I mean.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 yeah, SEE this isnt gonna work! Its just so perfect if I could go back in time, Id just relive that moment over and over again Hi daddy! Hi Daddy! Hi Daddy! Just tell Jackie the truth.
 <br>
 Then, if she leaves you for another man, whoever he might be, no hard feelings.
 <br>
 You do not need Jackie.
 <br>
 Sweet, luscious Jackie You are an evil little foreign man.
 <br>
 Dont ever change.
 <br>
 Look Kelso allright, Ill help you out with Jackie man, Ill talk you through the whole thing step by step.
 <br>
 Thanks man.
 <br>
 Yeah I guess it was wrong what I did with Laurie, but I was just amusing myself you know.
 <br>
 And thats the key to life right? Never stop amusing yourself.
 <br>
 Unless it starts to chafe.
 <br>
 Then you should take a week off.
 <br>
 Something&#39;s doesn&#39;t right Eric, Im asking you, have I been a bad father? Maybe Ive been to hard on her.
 <br>
 I mean for Gods sakes, I think Im a fair man.
 <br>
 Right ? Eric Im talking to you! Does this need more mayonaise? Get outta here! Thank you! Boy Kitty weve got a pair to beat a full house, thats for sure.
 <br>
 Well Red, relax.
 <br>
 Youre overreacting.
 <br>
 IM overreacting?! Well Ill tell you what Kitty, people are gonna talk.
 <br>
 Her living with that guy.
 <br>
 Red, it doesnt matter if people talk, Laurie is still a part of this family, which is why I invited her to dinner tonight.
 <br>
 Oh no no no, Kitty, Im not ready for that.
 <br>
 Oh thats sweet.
 <br>
 The way you say that like you have a choice.
 <br>
 Look Kitty Shes coming! Well Im glad were all eating dinner together as a family.
 <br>
 Yeah its nice.
 <br>
 Especially since Laurie could make it from all the way across town.
 <br>
 Where she lives.
 <br>
 With some guy.
 <br>
 In sin.
 <br>
 Will you ever hit puberty? Oh ow, but you know, whats really sad, is that youve got no respect for yourself.
 <br>
 or this family.
 <br>
 Daddy! Well hes not wrong! But Daddy! Red! Well Kitty, whos gonna buy the cow, when they get the milk for free? You know Dad, its not like shes hooking.
 <br>
 Or some other less Shes just living with a guy and it is the seventies now right.
 <br>
 What are you babling about? Well, maybe, maybe I just think youre being a little hard on her.
 <br>
 Well thats nice Eric.
 <br>
 But right now Im too angry to pretend to give a crap about what you think! These are great potatoes Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman! Thanks Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah sure.
 <br>
 Okay why dont you boys take your plates in and watch some McMillan and wife.
 <br>
 You know just once today Id like to finish a meal without being chased out of the room Well Laurie, you better stop your lying and face up to this one.
 <br>
 Just look at what youre doing to your father.
 <br>
 Mom, Im an adult okay? No no no, an adult would have told the truth, and not lied about moving with a girlfriend which I knew wasnt true.
 <br>
 WELL MOM, if you already knew then why didnt you tell Dad?! Then we wouldnt be in this mess! Oh my God, Rosemary had a better baby then me Okay, youve been acting kinda weird ever since Laurie gave you that t-shirt Michael.
 <br>
 Hydes head appears next to Kelsos: First off, act innocent! I dont know what youre talking about Jackie.
 <br>
 Hydes head: Ofcourse, shell explain herself.
 <br>
 Its like youre hiding something.
 <br>
 Hydes head: But you just stick to your original story Im sticking to my original story! Hydes head: Now, shell be sceptical Jackie: Uhuhhh Hydes head: So go on the offensive! You know Jackie, youre just being paranoid! And that hurts because you dont trust me and other stuff Hydes head: And then, shell be so embarrased, shell cave and apologize to you FINE! I believe you Michael, but know this: if youre NOT telling the truth I wil find out, cause Im smart, and youarent! Hydes head: And all you have to do is forgive her KELSO (confused): O.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 kayJackie I forgive you.
 <br>
 Red, I think youre being a little hard in Laurie.
 <br>
 I dont care what anyone thinks.
 <br>
 What she is doing is wrong.
 <br>
 Now that I think back on it, I dont know if I even knew that girl.
 <br>
 Living with a guy.
 <br>
 Oh is that a foreign car?! Oh jeez! Red, you have gone your whole life thinking she is just a little girl, but she is an adult now.
 <br>
 And she is not a perfect one.
 <br>
 Boy, is she not a perfect one! But you know what, you have to love your children even when they do things you dont like or better yet, hate.
 <br>
 You think you do a good job.
 <br>
 You think that you teach your children the difference between right and wrong and this is what you get! Well, to hell with it! Okay.
 <br>
 I guess we dont love her anymore, lets take all pictures of Laurie out of here and pretend shes not ours and if we see her on the street lets ignore het.
 <br>
 No, lets throw things at her.
 <br>
 Well now youre just being stupid.
 <br>
 And youre not being a good father.
 <br>
 Well.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 okay.
 <br>
 Maybe I have been uh kinda of uh A dumbass.
 <br>
 I was gonna say unreasonable Fine, fine, you were an unreasonable dumbass.
 <br>

 <br>

 <br>

 <br>

 <br>

 <br>
