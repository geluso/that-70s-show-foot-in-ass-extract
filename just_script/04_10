 So, what are you boys doing tonight? Well, this evening, Miss Big Rhonda returns from the dirt farms of Mississippi.
 <br>
 I am off to the bus station and she will melt into my loving arms.
 <br>
 Well, you better wear a raincoat, &#39;cause she ain&#39;t small.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) She is big, isn&#39;t she? ( Clears Throat, Sighs ) Well, I&#39;m taking this chick up to the lake for some you know, bird-watching.
 <br>
 Ooh, bird-watching.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) I think me and Jackie are going to go &#39;&#39;bird-watching&#39;&#39; too.
 <br>
 It&#39;s cool, &#39;cause they don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 Think they cracked it, Kelso.
 <br>
 Well, I guess it&#39;s just us Three Musketeers tonight, huh? ( Chuckles ) &#39;&#39;All for one and one for all,&#39;&#39; right? ( Chuckles ) Well, um, actually your father and I were gonna do some reading upstairs together.
 <br>
 What your mom&#39;s trying to say is, &#39;&#39;Go away for 20 minutes.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Forty-five minutes, Red.
 <br>
 - Thirty.
 <br>
 - Thirty-five.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Get lost for 3 5 minutes.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But you know what? I got a little question for you.
 <br>
 Why have kids if you ain&#39;t gonna spend time with them? I suggest you use your 3 5 minutes to think about that.
 <br>
 He needs a new girlfriend.
 <br>
 Come on, Kitty.
 <br>
 You&#39;re on the clock.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what? Just turn off your clock.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go talk to him.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t turn off the clock! She doesn&#39;t understand the clock.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Cocoa Puff!.
 <br>
 Mashed potato! - What are you doing here? - Well, I wanted to see you because I wanted to ask you something.
 <br>
 - Will you go out with me this Saturday? - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 - Course I will! - ( Chuckles ) ( Grunts ) Can&#39;t breathe.
 <br>
 - It hurts.
 <br>
 - Ah, suck it up.
 <br>
 Wow, strong girl.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Crap-alula.
 <br>
 Fez just asked me out.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so nervous, and I left my asthma puffer in Mississippi.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never been on a real date.
 <br>
 What am I gonna wear? Who cares? You could be naked with a welding hat and Fez&#39;d still be all over you.
 <br>
 Well, that sounds fun.
 <br>
 But I want it to be special.
 <br>
 - You know what? We&#39;ll help you get ready.
 <br>
 - Really? - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 - Oh, that&#39;ll be great.
 <br>
 I wanna look pretty.
 <br>
 Pretty? - Oh, sweetie, maybe you can learn some jokes or something.
 <br>
 - ( Trunk Closes ) Look, dropout, this coupon says - So pay up! - Is there, uh, a problem here? ( On P.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 ) This sad little man has fungussy feet but won&#39;t spend the 20- Stacy.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, his coupon expired.
 <br>
 - Oh, that&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 - ( Opens Register ) - ( Coins Rattling ) - Here&#39;s your 20 cents.
 <br>
 Now, you come again, huh? - Mushroom foot.
 <br>
 - Stacy! ( Sighs ) I&#39;m sorry, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that he&#39;s such a dumb-ass.
 <br>
 ( Pipe Organ:Religious ) I like you.
 <br>
 Hey, you know who I like? Nixon? Stacy, that cute, new cashier at work.
 <br>
 You should ask her out.
 <br>
 Sorry, Dad.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like to dip my pen in the company ink.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t like you being home three Fridays in a row.
 <br>
 Look, if you don&#39;t have the guts to talk to her - I&#39;ll pave the way.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Listen, if anyone&#39;s gonna talk to her I&#39;ll talk to her.
 <br>
 Well, then we know no one&#39;s gonna talk to her.
 <br>
 Hey, I might.
 <br>
 You- You still like girls, don&#39;t you, Son? No, Dad, they&#39;re yucky.
 <br>
 ( Kelso ) Oh, my God.
 <br>
 ( Eric ) I know.
 <br>
 She is seriously hot.
 <br>
 No, not her.
 <br>
 This KISS alarm clock.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 ( Man Singing Hard Rock ) ( Male Voice ) Wake up.
 <br>
 ( Ends ) Yeah, this I like.
 <br>
 Forman, you have a responsibility to all of us to find out what&#39;s underneath that smock.
 <br>
 I bet it&#39;s boobs.
 <br>
 So, spying on her, huh? Well, that&#39;s mature.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just pull her hair and run? - Yes, let&#39;s do that.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 All right, all right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go do this.
 <br>
 - Yeah, all right.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t do this.
 <br>
 - Oh, geez.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll go talk to her.
 <br>
 - No! What? Now you&#39;re gonna start listening to me? Go! Grease the wheels, pal.
 <br>
 Thanks for doing this.
 <br>
 I know you guys&#39;ll make me pretty and stuff.
 <br>
 Rhonda, it&#39;s no problem.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll just help you pick some nice clothes- clean clothes- and maybe do your hair- clean hair.
 <br>
 Okay, the beauty ambulance has arrived! ( Sighs ) So, first things first.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get rid of those shoulder pads.
 <br>
 What shoulder pads? Okay.
 <br>
 So, Stacy, my son Eric is about your age.
 <br>
 And he&#39;s a real nice guy- skinny but nice.
 <br>
 And I was thinking the two of you should go out.
 <br>
 What do you say? Well, I kinda like someone else.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh.
 <br>
 Oh no.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 - So, did she like me? - Who? - Stacy.
 <br>
 - Who&#39;s Stacy? - ( Clears Throat ) She&#39;s not interested.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s not interested? How can she not be interested? Who is she? See? I knew I shouldn&#39;t have let you talk to her.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Now she thinks I&#39;m a freak.
 <br>
 Oh, she doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re a freak.
 <br>
 Does she? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, she does.
 <br>
 - You better stay away from her.
 <br>
 - Well, your father&#39;s right.
 <br>
 If anyone&#39;s a freak, she is.
 <br>
 Did Stacy actually use the word &#39;&#39;freak&#39;&#39;? Why don&#39;t you just let it go? Maybe the reason girls don&#39;t like you is because you just don&#39;t let things go! Stacy was saying just that thing today.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go take a bath.
 <br>
 Well, now, who is this Stacy who doesn&#39;t like my son? I have half a mind to call her mother.
 <br>
 I tried to set Eric up with this pretty girl at wor- Well- ( Chuckles ) not pretty.
 <br>
 Decent.
 <br>
 Less ugly than most.
 <br>
 Good enough for a young boy, but no man would be interested.
 <br>
 Red, what are you talking about? Why can&#39;t anyone in this family just let things go? Red, you&#39;re blushing.
 <br>
 ( Kitty Gasps ) Don&#39;t tell me she has a crush on you.
 <br>
 Kitty, I don&#39;t wanna talk about it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, do you like her back? ( Kisses ) Hi.
 <br>
 Stacy.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Eric Forman.
 <br>
 Look, I, uh, feel a little silly about my dad asking you out for me.
 <br>
 You probably thought I was, like ugly or slow or something.
 <br>
 So, I just wanted to say hi- you know, give you a chance to you know, take a gander at the goods, so to speak- and, uh, see if maybe, uh, tomorrow night you wanted to have dinner? At your house? Will your dad be there? &#39;Cause I&#39;ll go if he&#39;s there.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 What, do you, like- ( Laughs ) do you, like, like my dad? Oh, my God! You like my dad? Do you know if he&#39;s seeing anyone? Yeah.
 <br>
 My mom.
 <br>
 And they bought furniture together, so yeah, I think it&#39;s pretty serious.
 <br>
 Ladies sit up straight.
 <br>
 Candy! Ca- -Jackie, she doesn&#39;t have to sit like that.
 <br>
 - Yes, she does.
 <br>
 - Stop doing that! - You stop doing that! Hey! If I don&#39;t get a freakin&#39; M&amp;M, I&#39;m gonna start swingin&#39;! You stay out of this.
 <br>
 - ( Hair Dryer Humming ) -Jackie, try to be more sensitive.
 <br>
 Donna, I am not gonna send her on her date looking like Sasquatch.
 <br>
 Huh? She said you&#39;re very pretty &#39;&#39;atch.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Hey, guys.
 <br>
 I got news.
 <br>
 Turns out Stacy doesn&#39;t even like me.
 <br>
 - Yeah, we kind of expected that.
 <br>
 - Ooh.
 <br>
 I thought you said you had news.
 <br>
 Well, yeah.
 <br>
 Here it comes.
 <br>
 - She likes Red.
 <br>
 - Ohh! - Oh, my God! - Ohh.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna have to leave town! - Why? - Oh, &#39;cause we&#39;re gonna tell everyone! ( Guffaws ) Tell me this.
 <br>
 How&#39;d the 50-year-old guy get the girl? Look at me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m an attractive man.
 <br>
 Well, I got you.
 <br>
 Technically, I got you.
 <br>
 And then you blew it.
 <br>
 Which means you didn&#39;t lose it, because you never had it.
 <br>
 See, there&#39;s your silver lining.
 <br>
 Eric, you have a lot of good qualities.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re funny.
 <br>
 Like- Well, what just happened to you is funny.
 <br>
 Look, that chick likes Red because he&#39;s a tough guy, a hard-ass.
 <br>
 You? You&#39;re soft.
 <br>
 ( Together) How soft is he, Hyde? Softer than Liberace at the Playboy Mansion.
 <br>
 Yeah! ( Laughs ) &#39;Cause he plays piano.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 ( Whispering ) Ohh! Burn! ( Howling Laugh ) ( Chuckles ) You guys kill me.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 How come Red is such a hard-ass, and I am so- I mean- Okay, when a bear has a baby it&#39;s a little bear, right? My dad&#39;s a bear, but I&#39;m like a duck.
 <br>
 Eric, you were a bear when you were born but Red pounded you into the duck that we know and love.
 <br>
 So, what are you saying? It&#39;s- It&#39;s Red&#39;s fault? Yeah.
 <br>
 But the good news is, as a duck you can move more easily through the water.
 <br>
 ( Man On TV) And now back to Night of the Living Dead.
 <br>
 ( Man On TV) And now back to Night of the Living Dead.
 <br>
 Is everything okay over there, Stacy? Come here, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I wanna show you something.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Holy crap! You&#39;re a zombie! ( Voice Deepens ) I want Red.
 <br>
 ( Screams ) Red! How could you? She&#39;s a sexy zombie! She overpowered me! I knew I couldn&#39;t trust you, you cheater! Kitty! ( Screaming ) ( Crying ) What the hell was that? Oh, Kitty.
 <br>
 Oh, I need to talk to you.
 <br>
 I just wanna say with regard to this Stacy thing- Look.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) I&#39;m bound to attract a certain amount of attention.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t help that.
 <br>
 - But I would never- - Oh, Red.
 <br>
 You wouldn&#39;t stray.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve got too much character.
 <br>
 And who could blame her for being interested? You&#39;re certainly interesting to me.
 <br>
 Really? Do you, uh have some spare time? Why? Am I on the clock? I&#39;m thinking 45 minutes.
 <br>
 Ohh.
 <br>
 The scenic route.
 <br>
 I give you the new Rhonda! First time in heels.
 <br>
 So, where&#39;s Fez? Oh, he&#39;s nervous, so he&#39;s in the &#39;&#39;whoo-hoo.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Have you been working on her all night? She wouldn&#39;t even let me pee.
 <br>
 I&#39;d squash her like a bug if I could catch her.
 <br>
 But I do look pretty.
 <br>
 Rhonda, is that you? Boy, you look like a different girl.
 <br>
 Do you like it? ( Snorting Laugh ) Oh! Well, I thought we would begin our evening with a hot dog eating contest.
 <br>
 Now, I realize you&#39;re county champion but I think I could make it interesting.
 <br>
 Sorry, Fez.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t eat hot dogs for glory or money anymore.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not ladylike.
 <br>
 - Says who? - Says them.
 <br>
 Them? What have you meddling whores done to my Rhonda? - It was Jackie.
 <br>
 - It was Donna.
 <br>
 Fez, she wouldn&#39;t let her pee or eat.
 <br>
 - Donna called her Sasquatch.
 <br>
 - That was you too! Shut up! Shut up.
 <br>
 I just want her back like she was the first night I met her- on her knees, chugging beer straight from the keg.
 <br>
 But, Fez, I threw up twice that night.
 <br>
 Yes all over my heart.
 <br>
 You big, lovable, clumsy galoot.
 <br>
 And now, it is time that you two left.
 <br>
 Good day.
 <br>
 - But, Fez- - He said, &#39;&#39;Good day&#39;&#39;! ( Groans ) So, I&#39;m a duck, huh? Yeah, we&#39;ll see who&#39;s a duck.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hey, there you are.
 <br>
 Yeah, we need to talk, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking out this whole Stacy thing- It&#39;s your fault.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You were too tough on me, so now I&#39;m soft.
 <br>
 Oh, boo-hoo.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know the first thing about tough.
 <br>
 My old man was tough.
 <br>
 When I was your age, he shipped me off to the navy.
 <br>
 He sure as hell wasn&#39;t settin&#39; me up with cute cashiers.
 <br>
 Which I&#39;m sorry I did.
 <br>
 Because now I&#39;ve got this creepy little girl giving me google eyes all day stickin&#39; heart-shaped notes in my locker.
 <br>
 And on top of it all I had to have a talk with your mother about infidelity.
 <br>
 That was unpleasant! So you just be grateful that your dad doesn&#39;t yell at you 2 4 hours a day! And don&#39;t give me that look, because this isn&#39;t yelling! When I yell, you&#39;ll know it! Well, thanks.
 <br>
 Good talk.
 <br>
 Man, look at all this stuff.
 <br>
 I just realized how happy I am not to be a girl.
 <br>
 Well, that should have happened at a much younger age.
 <br>
 ( Moans ) - How long was I out? - Long enough.
 <br>
 You guys wanna get a burger? Out in public? Okay, I&#39;ll drive.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll buy.
 <br>
