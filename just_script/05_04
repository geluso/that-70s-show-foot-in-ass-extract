 ( Laughs ) Why is Hyde kissin&#39;Jackie? What the hell? - He&#39;s dead! - Kelso! Open, damn it! No, they&#39;re gettin&#39; away! What is wrong with this thing? Well, this is against my better judgment, but- ( Clicks ) Thank you.
 <br>
 Now Hyde&#39;s really dead.
 <br>
 Oh! That&#39;s invisible! ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) Donna, we have to stabilize him.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna need pudding, and lots of it.
 <br>
 Who chooses a chick over a friend? Kelso, come on.
 <br>
 Remember when you made me walk home in a blizzard &#39;cause you wanted 1 0 extra minutes to make out with Pam Macy? No, but I didn&#39;t steal Pam Macy from you.
 <br>
 And you could&#39;ve played in the snow until we were done.
 <br>
 Kelso, try to look at the facts.
 <br>
 Jackie wanted to get married, so you bailed so she found someone else, so now she doesn&#39;t wanna marry you.
 <br>
 This solves your problem, albeit with an unpleasant twist ending.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kickin&#39; Hyde&#39;s ass.
 <br>
 Kelso, Kelso, come on.
 <br>
 You couldn&#39;t open my kitchen door.
 <br>
 I mean- Seriously, think about how this plan usually turns out.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) That&#39;s my eye! Nice.
 <br>
 Aah.
 <br>
 My eye! ( Groaning ) ( Car Radio:Rock ) ( Shouting ) That&#39;s my butt print! Look at it! No two are the same! Ow! ( Crying ) My eye! Uh, what am I supposed to do? He broke the code! He&#39;s wrong! You know what? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 He&#39;s, like, my oldest friend, and he stabbed me in the back.
 <br>
 So, Kelso, how many things around here have you put your butt on? Let&#39;s start with what I haven&#39;t put my butt on.
 <br>
 Oh,just a moment.
 <br>
 Red, it&#39;s somebody about buying the Corvette.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) Well, Marlin, we&#39;ve just seen the male of the herd grunt his displeasure.
 <br>
 But what does it mean? - The grunting indicates aggression,Jim.
 <br>
 - Ah! Idiots.
 <br>
 I am about to sell something special to me, because we&#39;re having another baby.
 <br>
 And to do that, I have to believe that this child won&#39;t turn out a smart-ass! Hello.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t call here again.
 <br>
 - Well, what happened? - The guy sounded like he was eating.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want some fat bastard eating in my car.
 <br>
 Anyway, I&#39;m going to the doctor&#39;s this afternoon- ( Singsongy ) because I&#39;m pregnant! Oh.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re picking your grandparents up from the airport.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to tell them that ( Singsongy ) I&#39;m pregnant! They get in from Phoenix at 5:00.
 <br>
 You know, I was hoping when they moved to Arizona, they&#39;d get lost in the desert.
 <br>
 -What&#39;s wrong with Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s parents? -Nothing.
 <br>
 They&#39;re just- They&#39;re very complicated people who can&#39;t be summed up in a couple of words.
 <br>
 - Grandma yells, Grandpa drinks.
 <br>
 - That pretty much summed it up.
 <br>
 Now, that is not true.
 <br>
 My father is a wonderful man who just gets a little sleepy.
 <br>
 And my mother, well- fine- is a little remote which, I have learned through many helpful books makes it impossible for her to say, &#39;&#39;I love you.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Even if it&#39;s the only thing in the world a sad little girl needs to hear.
 <br>
 And which is why I say it to you every day.
 <br>
 Eric, I love you.
 <br>
 - ( Kisses ) - ( Chuckling ) And you too, Steven.
 <br>
 I love you! Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 No, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to- No, that&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) Okay, I love you too.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe that you knew Jackie and Hyde were together and you didn&#39;t tell me.
 <br>
 We barely knew.
 <br>
 Yeah, we knew, but we were in denial because it&#39;s so unnatural.
 <br>
 Like radioactive spiders.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 I&#39;m- It&#39;s just- How can Hyde do this to me? - Uh-oh.
 <br>
 It sounds like he knows.
 <br>
 - Finally.
 <br>
 What, your mom knew? And Fez? Fez never knows anything! I know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really coming into my own.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 You know, none of this is as bad as Hyde not telling me.
 <br>
 You know what I&#39;m gonna do? I&#39;m gonna make him tell me.
 <br>
 - How are you gonna do that? - By outwitting him conversationally.
 <br>
 What a fine game of cat and mouse it will be.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go find an eye patch.
 <br>
 - So, what are you gonna say? - Oh, it&#39;ll come to me in the moment.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you think you should plan it out a little? Does an astronaut plan out his missions? What happens in cat and mouse if the cat is retarded? Oh, you just wait and see.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) - What&#39;s up? - That&#39;s an interesting question, Hyde.
 <br>
 What is up? - Well, I guess you know about me and Jackie.
 <br>
 - Ahh! So the battle of wits has begun! What battle of wits? I admit it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been messin&#39; around with Jackie.
 <br>
 I hate you! Ow! My eye! Thanks again for the dream catchers.
 <br>
 A blind Indian with three fingers made those.
 <br>
 It was quite a thing to watch.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I wonder if him being blind had something to do with the losing the fingers.
 <br>
 Actually, I think they were taken as part of a primitive manhood ritual.
 <br>
 Eric, I kinda like your grandparents.
 <br>
 What were you so worried about? - Wait for it.
 <br>
 - Burt, sweetie, I think that car is trying to pass.
 <br>
 - Why don&#39;t you move over? - Oh, he&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Honey, I really think you should move over.
 <br>
 - Sweetie, he can go around.
 <br>
 - ( Shouts ) Move! - I&#39;m moving.
 <br>
 - ( Tires Squealing ) And when he saw you guys kissing, he just fell apart.
 <br>
 I mean, it was awful.
 <br>
 And then he ran into the screen door.
 <br>
 Oh, he&#39;s just so bad at doors.
 <br>
 Look, if you don&#39;t work things out with Kelso everybody&#39;s gonna choose sides, and nobody&#39;s gonna be friends anymore.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s not my fault.
 <br>
 Look, he deserted me.
 <br>
 He broke my heart.
 <br>
 - I didn&#39;t do anything wrong.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re dating his best friend! You&#39;ve gotta talk to him.
 <br>
 You owe him an explanation.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) This is so not the way I wanted to spend the day.
 <br>
 Well, I didn&#39;t wanna spend the day wiping tears and pudding off of Kelso&#39;s cheek.
 <br>
 Burt, honey, why don&#39;t you come over and sit with us? I&#39;m fine here.
 <br>
 We&#39;d really like it if you would sit and join the party.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m part of the party right here.
 <br>
 - ( Shouts ) Sit! ( Sighs ) So, Burt, you&#39;re lookin&#39; fit.
 <br>
 Dry heat and central air.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the key.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve even got an air-conditioned garage.
 <br>
 We can go from the house to the car without ever feeling the heat.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 They literally never have to breathe fresh air.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Who needs it? Yep.
 <br>
 ( Forced Chuckle ) Well, those are some real nice sandals, Burt.
 <br>
 Hardly ever see those on men.
 <br>
 Also made by the handicapped Indian.
 <br>
 What spirit.
 <br>
 Oh, um, everybody&#39;s here.
 <br>
 - Here she is.
 <br>
 - Hello, Mom, Daddy.
 <br>
 Kitty, tell everyone your wonderful news.
 <br>
 Quick.
 <br>
 - I&#39;d really rather not right now, Red.
 <br>
 - But that&#39;s why we&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Yeah, for the love of God, Mom, tell them.
 <br>
 - No, I said not right now.
 <br>
 - Kitty, they came all this way.
 <br>
 - Yeah, come on.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 You wanna hear the big news? The doctor told me I started menopause.
 <br>
 Kitty, language! - You&#39;re not pregnant? - Nope.
 <br>
 Nope.
 <br>
 Just barren.
 <br>
 Talk about that.
 <br>
 Mom, I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 I know you wanted a baby, but I&#39;m not really sure what to say mainly because I&#39;m not really sure what menopause is.
 <br>
 Are you-Are you gonna, like, lose your hair? Shut up! She&#39;s not losing anything.
 <br>
 This just means that from time to time- A woman&#39;s body- ( Clears Throat ) Kitty, explain it to the boy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just getting some juice.
 <br>
 Hey, Mom, maybe you should talk to Grandma about this.
 <br>
 Now, that&#39;s an idea.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;re just ignoramuses.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 Scoot.
 <br>
 Is it- Is it like a lady-parts thing? We&#39;ll look it up in the World Book.
 <br>
 Oh, those cookies look good.
 <br>
 Well, thanks.
 <br>
 Sorry I made a scene.
 <br>
 Oh, you were just tired.
 <br>
 No, I wasn&#39;t just tired.
 <br>
 Mom, I&#39;m having a really hard time here.
 <br>
 Did it hit you this hard too? - Did what, dear? - Menopause.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) I never had it.
 <br>
 Mom, everybody has it.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve always been quite health conscious.
 <br>
 I told you to eat more vegetables.
 <br>
 You cannot expect me to believe that you never went through menopause.
 <br>
 - Well, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Yes, you did! Well, it doesn&#39;t matter, because it&#39;s not nice to talk about.
 <br>
 Not everything that needs to be talked about has to be nice.
 <br>
 Mom, why don&#39;t you ever really talk to me? I told you I liked your cookies! I&#39;m gonna find your father.
 <br>
 ( Shouts ) Burt! Is she gone? You know, that woman is crazy.
 <br>
 Your mother just doesn&#39;t know how to talk to people.
 <br>
 If she yells at you she really means that she&#39;s sorry you&#39;re upset.
 <br>
 And if she breaks all your golf clubs she means &#39;&#39;happy anniversary.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, Daddy, I love you.
 <br>
 I love you, punkin, and so does your mother.
 <br>
 ( Bea Shouts ) Burt.
 <br>
 ! - You never saw me.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Try to get my eye now! ( Groaning ) Hyde, get off!.
 <br>
 Not until you calm down.
 <br>
 - Ah! A wet one! - ( Grunts ) Fez, I&#39;m gonna get free eventually, and then I&#39;m gonna kick your ass! ( Grunting ) Kelso, look, man, we need to settle this.
 <br>
 No, I don&#39;t wanna settle this! I don&#39;t wanna talk about it! All I wanna do is pound you so you can feel as bad as I do! Fine.
 <br>
 Fair enough.
 <br>
 Go ahead and hit me.
 <br>
 Free shot.
 <br>
 You gonna hit me back? No, man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why they call it a free shot.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Get ready.
 <br>
 Here it comes.
 <br>
 It&#39;s comin&#39;.
 <br>
 Get ready.
 <br>
 We&#39;re ready.
 <br>
 Do it, fool! You know what? Forget it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not gonna change anything.
 <br>
 I just- Forget it.
 <br>
 Look, Kelso I didn&#39;t plan for this, but- Look, I&#39;m sorry, okay? I&#39;m- I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 ( Fez, Donna ) Aw! Would you get bent? -So what are we gonna do now? -I&#39;ll tell you what you guys are gonna do.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) You two are gonna shake hands, and you&#39;re gonna be done with it.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Give it a try.
 <br>
 Shake hands.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t wanna.
 <br>
 - ( Shouts ) Shake! - ( Sighs ) - Well, well.
 <br>
 Look who it is.
 <br>
 Uh, look, Michael, I&#39;m glad I found you.
 <br>
 - How&#39;s your eye? - What do you care? Okay.
 <br>
 Look, Michael, I know we should&#39;ve told you sooner but I&#39;m not gonna say I&#39;m sorry because I wanted you, and you left and broke my heart.
 <br>
 And I like Steven now so you need to get over it so we can all become friends again.
 <br>
 Apology accepted.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Here, let me help you.
 <br>
 - Ow.
 <br>
 My eye.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 - How you doin&#39;? - Oh, great.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so nice to no longer be a woman.
 <br>
 Kitty, that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ve been tryin&#39; to think what I could do to- to make you feel better, and I finally came up with something.
 <br>
 I sent your parents home early.
 <br>
 That kinda helps.
 <br>
 I just- I really wanted to be pregnant.
 <br>
 You know what the real kicker is? This morning, when we thought you were still pregnant I sold my Corvette.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Memorial Day, meningitis- Okay, here we go.
 <br>
 Menopause.
 <br>
 Good God! I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d have pictures.
 <br>
 Well, at least they use the word &#39;&#39;uterus&#39;&#39; a lot.
 <br>
 I could&#39;ve gone a whole lifetime without knowing they had a mucus membrane.
 <br>
 Well, you just- You can&#39;t unlearn something like that, you know? Oh, no.
 <br>
 Look at the symptoms.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Temperamental behavior, mood swings, facial hair.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Dad, I think you have menopause.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric, can you hand me a cookie? No, I can&#39;t reach while I&#39;m driving.
 <br>
 - Come on.
 <br>
 Please? Just one cookie.
 <br>
 -Just wait till I stop.
 <br>
 ( Shouts ) Cookie! You know, Donna, you catch more flies with sugar.
 <br>
 Right, Burt? ( Snoring )
 <br>
