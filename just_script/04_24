 Okay, my friends.
 <br>
 Invitations to see Fez in tonight&#39;s Spring Sing charmingly illustrated by the hand of Fez.
 <br>
 Great, something to put my gum in.
 <br>
 Just kidding.
 <br>
 Oh, man, this concert&#39;s tonight? Yes, it&#39;s tonight.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been talking about it for weeks! - Don&#39;t you listen to me? - Fez, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting so upset about.
 <br>
 - You know we don&#39;t listen to you.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I don&#39;t know, Fez.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m still kind of tired from the party last night.
 <br>
 Party? What party? You know, the party.
 <br>
 You were there.
 <br>
 No, I do not know, and I was not there.
 <br>
 - Someone forgot to tell me.
 <br>
 - Wait, are you sure? &#39;Cause I could have sworn you were there.
 <br>
 Remember when the college girl got up on the table and took her top off? - What? - Yeah, that was great, man.
 <br>
 Wait, even Smokey the Bear was there? Fine.
 <br>
 Fine, what&#39;s done is done.
 <br>
 The important thing is where you&#39;re going to be tonight- at my concert watching me.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s gonna be such a wonderful evening.
 <br>
 Music, good friends and dancing.
 <br>
 Just like life should be.
 <br>
 ( Rock ) ( Singing Rock ) ( All Vocalizing ) ( All Singing ) ( Solo ) ( All ) ( Solo ) This is my favorite part.
 <br>
 ( Rock And Roll Flourish ) ( Ends ) So, what do you think? I think whatever you&#39;re on, I&#39;ll take two of&#39;em.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! ( Singing Scale ) Perfecto.
 <br>
 Oh, Fez, was that you? I could have sworn I just heard Wayne Newton.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman! You came to my concert! Well, it&#39;s the Spring Sing.
 <br>
 There is no place we&#39;d rather be than the Spring Sing.
 <br>
 Now, Kitty, that&#39;s just a lie.
 <br>
 Ay, here comes my music teacher, Mr.
 <br>
 Wilkinson.
 <br>
 He is unpleasant.
 <br>
 Are you the parents of this horrible little man? I&#39;ll have you know, he&#39;s been imitating my accent behind my back.
 <br>
 Well, first of all, we are not his parents and second of all- Well, the rest of it, I just don&#39;t care about.
 <br>
 I&#39;m moving you to the back row so that no one can hear that squawk box that you call a voice.
 <br>
 The back row? But the back row is for the untalented and the ugly! - Ay, you are no fun.
 <br>
 - Music is not about fun.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about passion and commitment.
 <br>
 Have you ever been moved to tears by the warbling timbre of your own voice? No, because I am a man.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Well, he just, um- He doesn&#39;t seem to like you at all.
 <br>
 The British have always hated my people.
 <br>
 We won the war, buddy.
 <br>
 Get over it! Oh, good one, Fez.
 <br>
 Well, you certainly seem in high spirits.
 <br>
 Of course.
 <br>
 Soon all of my friends are gonna be here and we&#39;ll be all like a family.
 <br>
 I wish you were my family.
 <br>
 Oh, we would be so happy together.
 <br>
 Okay, kids, it&#39;s nighty-night time.
 <br>
 - Good night, Mom.
 <br>
 - Night, Ma.
 <br>
 - ( Kisses ) - That&#39;s my mama! I love you, Fez.
 <br>
 I love you more! I love you the most! Daddy! All right.
 <br>
 Sleep tight.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t let the bed bugs put their foot in your ass.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) - ( Kitty ) Okay, boys, lights out.
 <br>
 ! And no more staying up till 8:30 giving each other hugs! - ( All Groaning ) - See you in the morning.
 <br>
 ( Alarm Ringing ) ( Rock ) ( Singing Rock ) ( All ) - Are you people singing again? - Yes? Good, &#39;cause- ( Singing Rock ) ( Together) ( All ) - ( Engine Revving ) -  ( Continues ) ( Ends ) Well, that was detailed.
 <br>
 You are one fruity kid.
 <br>
 Now, remember singing is all about the use of the diaphragm.
 <br>
 - ( Inhales ) - ( Giggling ) ( Sighs ) And what&#39;s so funny about the proper use of the diaphragm? It&#39;s the muscle you breathe with.
 <br>
 - Below your bosom! - ( Giggling ) Oh! Bloody imbeciles.
 <br>
 So, this must be a very exciting night for you.
 <br>
 Yes, yes.
 <br>
 If the mayor likes what he sees I&#39;ll be directing this year&#39;s Dairy Days Dance-abration.
 <br>
 Oh, that is always wonderful.
 <br>
 One time, they had a quartet dressed as cows and they sang &#39;&#39;Blue Moo-oo-oon.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughs ) &#39;Cause they were cows! Yes, I&#39;m sure you thick-headed Americans could hardly contain your grunts.
 <br>
 Well, I thought it was delightful.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody! Bob! Hey, I saved seats for you and the gang.
 <br>
 - Oh, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re coming.
 <br>
 - Of course they are.
 <br>
 Well, you know, I asked if they needed a ride, but they said, &#39;&#39;No.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; When I left, they were just sittin&#39; in the basement, laughin&#39;.
 <br>
 But the show&#39;s about to start.
 <br>
 Ooh! Then I better get to the refreshment table.
 <br>
 Did you know that all that stuff was free? It says donations accepted, but you don&#39;t gotta put nothin&#39; in.
 <br>
 My friends are still in the basement? - I wonder what they&#39;re doing.
 <br>
 - Oh, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just- Miss Kitty, please! I&#39;m trying to wonder.
 <br>
 Ooh, guys.
 <br>
 Fez&#39;s concert is about to start- Which means we have three more hours without his sorry ass! Let&#39;s eat his candy! Yeah.
 <br>
 ( Imitating Fez ) My name is Fez.
 <br>
 I love candy.
 <br>
 Whore! Good day.
 <br>
 I said, good day! Yeah, and the best part is, that idiot actually thinks I&#39;m his friend.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Like I care.
 <br>
 I wish he were dead.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, we should kill him! No, I got a better idea.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s sing without him! - ( Rock ) -  ( Singing Rock ) Yeah! ( Guitar Notes ) ( All ) ( Guitar Solo ) ( Ends ) So, they would rather make fun of me than come here.
 <br>
 Well, honey, you know, at least they&#39;re singing- like you&#39;ll be doin&#39; real soon.
 <br>
 ( Singing Upbeat Pop ) Is there a bar here? You know, last night they went to a party without me- a topless party.
 <br>
 - What? - Where? They were the first people to be nice to me when I came to America but maybe I am not their friend.
 <br>
 Maybe I am just a goofy foreign kid.
 <br>
 Well, can&#39;t you be both? I would settle for friend, but I don&#39;t even think I am that.
 <br>
 Well, you still got &#39;&#39;goofy foreign kid.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; That&#39;s something.
 <br>
 ( Marching Band ) Well, the butts are in the seats but not one butt is the butt of a friend.
 <br>
 Well, this is just rude.
 <br>
 They better have run out of gas or hit a deer or something.
 <br>
 Okay, places everyone! Let&#39;s show them what we&#39;ve got.
 <br>
 Teeth and cleavage! Teeth and cleavage! Well, that does it! Now I am mad! All they care about is themselves and their stupid, messed-up relationships.
 <br>
 Boo-hoo! Love hurts! Well they deserve it! Aw, geez, not another one.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Do we really have to go see that foreign boy sing? I&#39;m not going.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in too much pain from our breakup.
 <br>
 Even though it was months ago, it still affects every part of my life.
 <br>
 Me, me, me! No! Me, me, me! Wait.
 <br>
 What about me, me, me? - Me! - Me! - Me! ( All ) Me! ( Rock Ballad ) ( Singing Rock Ballad ) ( Sobbing ) ( All ) ( Disco ) ( All Singing Disco ) - ( Rock Ballad Resumes ) -  ( Singing Rock Ballad ) ( All ) ( Ends ) Wow, I just caught the end, but that was nice.
 <br>
 - Leo, you made it.
 <br>
 - What, this? No, I got this at a church sale.
 <br>
 Hey, where&#39;s that dude and that other dude, and that girl and that dude, and the other girl? They&#39;re not here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just me alone- always alone.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) ( Singing Ballad ) ( Sniffs ) ( Slows, Ends ) Aw, forget it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going home! Hi, Fez! Where the hell have you been? Well, we were on our way here when we passed by your music teacher&#39;s house.
 <br>
 And I said, &#39;&#39;Fez hates that guy.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s toilet-paper it!&#39;&#39; So- So we did! ( No Audible Dialogue ) ( No Audible Dialogue ) - For me? - Yeah, and then we had to go get some dog poop &#39;cause we looked at his porch and realized, &#39;&#39;Hey, Not enough dog poop.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( No Audible Dialogue ) ( No Audible Dialogue ) There&#39;s enough dog poop now.
 <br>
 And we got you an opening-night present.
 <br>
 - Congratulations, buddy! - ( Laughs ) Bloody hell, is that my mailbox? ( Imitating Wilkinson ) Bloody &#39;ell, is that me mailbox? - ( Laughs ) That&#39;s dead on! - Yes, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all remember this fondly as you rot in your Barcaloungers cheeseburgers clenched in your fat American fists! You got that right, buddy! Aw.
 <br>
 Look who has so many friends! Don&#39;t ever leave him alone with us again.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad you came.
 <br>
 Tonight wouldn&#39;t mean anything without you guys.
 <br>
 Aw, Fez, we wouldn&#39;t miss it.
 <br>
 - I mean- -  ( All Singing Pop ) ( All Singing Disco ) ( Guitar Solo ) ( All Singing Disco Resumes ) ( Ends ) Boy, do I know how to shake it.
 <br>
 Imbecile, you&#39;re on! Well, that&#39;s my cue! This is just like A Star Is Born, and I am Barbra Streisand.
 <br>
 Love me! I&#39;m so happy to be back home with my friends.
 <br>
 ( Singing Rock ) No, nobody calls you that.
 <br>
 And if anyone&#39;s the space cowboy, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 What? In your dreams, Forman.
 <br>
 I am widely acknowledged as the space cowboy of this group.
 <br>
 And I also call &#39;&#39;midnight toker.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Wow.
 <br>
 This cheeseburger is bloody brilliant.
 <br>
 ( All Singing Disco ) ( Screams ) Dude, come here.
 <br>
 ( All Singing Rock ) Good, &#39;cause- ( Singing Rock ) ( Woman ) Cut.
 <br>
 ! - You had it! - That was your best one! ( All Singing Disco, Ends ) - ( Woman ) Cut.
 <br>
 ! - ( All Laughing )
