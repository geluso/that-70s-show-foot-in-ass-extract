 Donna have you noticed that every time we do what we just did, it is always fun? Eric you&#39;re so cute.
 <br>
 Oww, oww.
 <br>
 Donna I think by cute you mean ruggedly handsome.
 <br>
 You read my mind Eric.
 <br>
 Oh yeah that&#39;s the other thingafter we do that thing I don&#39;t really feel like an Eric.
 <br>
 really.
 <br>
 Uh yeah, I think I feel more like a Stan or a Chuck or a, a Maverick.
 <br>
 Do you want to go to a movie tomorrow Maverick? Oh uh, I told Kelso and Fez I&#39;d hang out with them.
 <br>
 Really.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hey but uh, you can come too if you want.
 <br>
 No that&#39;s ok.
 <br>
 Uh really, you should come No you go, have fun.
 <br>
 Are you sure? Sure, it&#39;s not big deal.
 <br>
 Ok, cool.
 <br>
 Swedish pancakes? What&#39;s the catch? Oh no catch, eat them while they&#39;re hot, there&#39;s plenty.
 <br>
 Wow, this is a real treat Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Psst, careful Steven, there&#39;s always a string attached to Swedish pancakes, trust me.
 <br>
 Mom you only make Swedish pancakes when something horrible is about to happen.
 <br>
 Does someone have cancer? No, no, no.
 <br>
 No one has horrible cancer.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s just sit down as a family and enjoy our special pancakes.
 <br>
 Gotcha! We&#39;re all going to the nursing home to visit Aunt Pearl.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t she dead yet? Laurie! Well she is old so, maybe we should call ahead.
 <br>
 Red, can you believe this family? Well, the Bucs are playing the Celtics.
 <br>
 Oh come on.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m asking is for a quick visit.
 <br>
 Real quick.
 <br>
 Quick, quick, quick.
 <br>
 Say kids how bout a nice trip to old Aunt Pearl&#39;s? Hey! Thank you Red.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have to go, do I? I&#39;ve already been to see her three times this year.
 <br>
 Uh yeah, and I&#39;m a virgin.
 <br>
 God I miss Jackie.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t think, I can still eat, but I mean my life has no meaning.
 <br>
 I&#39;m dead inside.
 <br>
 Oh, so that&#39;s what smells.
 <br>
 Yeah Mr.
 <br>
 Brokenheart, when was the last time you took a bath man? Woo, you&#39;re getting gamey.
 <br>
 Man, I am so glad Donna&#39;s not Jackie, but I&#39;ll tell you what, I&#39;m even more glad I&#39;m not you.
 <br>
 No offense.
 <br>
 I gotta win Jackie back.
 <br>
 I got it! I&#39;ll write her a song.
 <br>
 Maybe the best way to get Jackie back is to let her date other people foreign exchange people.
 <br>
 No man, I think a song is a really great idea.
 <br>
 How bout this one You don&#39;t love me anymore.
 <br>
 Caught me cheatin with a whore.
 <br>
  See cause Laurie&#39;s the whore, you get it? Yeah, my sister is such a whore.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m gonna write Jackie a song.
 <br>
 I gotta win her back because I can&#39;t stop the tears man.
 <br>
 Kelso, we&#39;ve been over this there&#39;s, no crying in the circle.
 <br>
 And then Eric says, You can comeif you want.
 <br>
  if you want? Ouch.
 <br>
 Right? I don&#39;t know, I think he&#39;s sorta taking me for granted.
 <br>
 Ahh I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m just overreacting.
 <br>
 No Donna, you&#39;re underreacting.
 <br>
 All men take all women for granted all the time.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Save yourself the heartache Donna.
 <br>
 Break up with Eric now before it&#39;s too late.
 <br>
 Then we can be single girls together! Oohh, we could take a cruise! I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just worried.
 <br>
 I mean if he&#39;s acting like this now imagine what would happen if we got married or something.
 <br>
 Gloria I just looked at her.
 <br>
 She was just giving me change.
 <br>
 No, Michael it wasn&#39;t a look is was a looook.
 <br>
  Oh my, please don&#39;t fight, your father will be home any minute.
 <br>
 Wow Ma, you&#39;re all dressed up.
 <br>
 Oh yeah, your father&#39;s taking me out tonight.
 <br>
 Well good for you ma, you deserve a night out.
 <br>
 Well ho, ho, ho and whoopdy doo, I&#39;m home.
 <br>
 Oh hi Archie! Oh geez Edith, no time for the kisses there, the fight&#39;s about to start.
 <br>
 But Daddy, you told Ma you were taking her out tonight.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true Arch.
 <br>
 Shut up you Meathead you! Well if you ask my opinion, maybe you just forgot.
 <br>
 Ahh geez Edith there, I didn&#39;t forget nothin&#39; so get me a beer and stifle it.
 <br>
 Oh my.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Oh my god Jackie, what am I gonna do? I don&#39;t know Donna, I just don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Oh hi Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Go talk on your own damn porch! So you been playing much bingo Pearl? Pearl : Oh for god sakes Kitty, I ate your damn pudding so go! Laurie, say something nice.
 <br>
 Finesomething nice.
 <br>
 Pearl : That&#39;s my magazine.
 <br>
 Nobody needs to see that.
 <br>
 Pearl :  Get out! You know it&#39;s weird, I though that after me and Michael broke up I wouldn&#39;t want to hang out here anymore.
 <br>
 Yup, that&#39;s what we&#39;re hoping.
 <br>
 But I think if I left you&#39;d really miss me.
 <br>
 Right? I umm suppose that, you know it&#39;s important when you have uh a bad breakup that you uh have friends to uh sympathetic uh stuff umm support and uhh I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Right, so let&#39;s go to the mall.
 <br>
 No uh I meant friends like Donna or not me.
 <br>
 But I noticed you&#39;re alone a lot and I&#39;m alone a lot, so let&#39;s be alone together.
 <br>
 Look, we&#39;re alone right now.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not really a very good reason for us to Wait.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go to Sizzler.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve got a salad bar, it&#39;s all you can eat plus five different colors of Jello.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll buy.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve been through a rough time, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Song for Jackie by Michael Kelso You may think this song is stupid So I made a call to cupid And he told me to put my heart out on my sleeve So we can retrieve Our love from the trash, trash, trash What do you think? Well, I think that you should draw her a picture.
 <br>
 Hey pal, you think you&#39;re funny? Well someday Donna&#39;s gonna crush your stupid little heart too.
 <br>
 Yeah see I don&#39;t think so because I&#39;ve taken special precautions to prevent that very thing from happening.
 <br>
 For instance, I don&#39;t sleep with other women Yeah, well it&#39;s only because you&#39;re chicken.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey baby, let&#39;s say you grab papa a root beer, huh? Oh my god.
 <br>
 I cannot look.
 <br>
 Listen you worm, I am not your slave or your waitress or your maid, now don&#39;t get all Archie Bunkery on me or I will kick your ass to the moon! Hey Eric, what rhymes with Donna? I didn&#39;t mean to cheat, but she forced me down right coerced me Hey, that&#39;s kinda good.
 <br>
 Man, I just asked her for a root beer.
 <br>
 You try to control her Eric and the woman always controls the man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Donna does not control me! Oh Eric, you have so much to learn, my friend.
 <br>
 Yeah, I wish Jackie was still controlling me.
 <br>
 I love being on a short leash Put the short leash back on me!!! Kelso, uh let me see that for a second You know that was kinda funny.
 <br>
 That was your guitar.
 <br>
 BURN!! Hyde, those boots look really nice on you.
 <br>
 You know Jackie, you buying me boots was just wrong, shoulda let me shoplift them.
 <br>
 No Hyde, I want you to have them.
 <br>
 Besides, I&#39;m saving a fortune now that I don&#39;t have to feed and clothe Michael.
 <br>
 Well, if you insist.
 <br>
 I do.
 <br>
 So I was thinking tomorrow night we should you know.
 <br>
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, ok alright come on now Jackie, this was a one time only thing alright? And if you&#39;re trying to bribe me with these boots you can just take them back.
 <br>
 I see.
 <br>
 Oh what are you going to do now, cry? Oh man, you&#39;re crying .
 <br>
 Hey Jackie, come on man, it&#39;s going to be fine ok? This whole thing is going to be fine alright? No!! Bad Jackie! But Hyde, I thought we agreed that you were alone and I was alone Jackie I&#39;m trying to help you out here, so you&#39;ve gotta just listen to me.
 <br>
 You have to know that you can do better than Kelso.
 <br>
 But what if I never find anybody else? Oh you will man, you&#39;ll find somebody great.
 <br>
 See I myself don&#39;t like you, I find you abrasive, but if I didn&#39;t know you and I&#39;d never talked to you, I&#39;d think you were totally hot.
 <br>
 Thank you Hyde.
 <br>
 Anything for you doll.
 <br>
 Pearl honey, please come out.
 <br>
 Laurie, she kinda likes you, do something.
 <br>
 Aunt Pearl why don&#39;t you come out and you can show me your damn scrapbooks again.
 <br>
 Pearl : Every time you people come I gotta get dressed and put my teeth in and you&#39;re not worth it so get lost! Now can we go? No.
 <br>
 Ok fine, I give up.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just go.
 <br>
 I just hope when I get old someone comes to visit me.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be ridiculous Mom, Eric will come.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m gonna go warm the car up.
 <br>
 No Laurie, this is important to your mother, so sit down.
 <br>
 Come on Pearl, there&#39;s a Bucs game on! Pearl : The Bucs huh? Well now see, this is nice.
 <br>
 Pearl : The only thing that keeps me alive is watching the Bucks lose! Go Bucks.
 <br>
 Michael, I don&#39;t want to talk to you! No you&#39;re right ok because words don&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I wrote this song.
 <br>
 Oh god.
 <br>
 Jackie please take me backie - I&#39;ll get the knack see - Ok Michael, stop.
 <br>
 Michael Stop Yes please Kelso, stop.
 <br>
 I cannot take this anymore.
 <br>
 This is how you serenade a woman.
 <br>
 Bessame, besssame mucho come si fuera esta noche la ultima bess What are you doing? Yeah, what are you doing? Ummm, this is my school song from back home I don&#39;t know Hey what&#39;s going on? Nothing.
 <br>
 Nothing at all.
 <br>
 Thank you Hyde for tonight, it was very special.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t she nice? Hey fellas, you like my new boots? And then Eric says to Donna I cannot go out with you because I am going out with the guys.
 <br>
  Oh geez.
 <br>
 What? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the problem.
 <br>
 No, What&#39;s His Name Is Right, that&#39;s the problem.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t think I did anything wrong.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not going to apologize to Donna.
 <br>
 Oh yeah? What? Why? Here&#39;s the thing, you&#39;re assuming that you&#39;re good enough for Donna and you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Yes I am.
 <br>
 No you&#39;re not, just like I&#39;m not good enough for your mother.
 <br>
 Ok wellyeah that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Hey, watch it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m trying to help you out here.
 <br>
 Ok yes sir.
 <br>
 Look, do you really think I wanted to spend the whole damn day sitting in a room with a woman who hates the Bucs and smells like cabbage? Well I didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s the price you pay son.
 <br>
 Now you go call Donna before she realizes how much better off she is without you.
 <br>
 Go on now, go! Go!! You heard him, go! But what about Blah, blah, blahmake the call little man.
 <br>
 Listen Donna No, wait.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking about you know what happened and I realize I might have overreacted.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just I&#39;m a little vulnerable now that our relationship has matured.
 <br>
 Donna, no apology necessary.
 <br>
 I welcome your insane behavior and criticism.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be a jerk Eric.
 <br>
 No no, I&#39;m actually, I&#39;m being serious.
 <br>
 I&#39;m willing to do whatever it takes for us to be together.
 <br>
 Whatever it takes, it&#39;s worth it.
 <br>
 Well, thank you.
 <br>
 So uh, for future reference, do I have to ask you before I go out with my friends? No yes sometimes.
 <br>
 So uh, how will I know which times.
 <br>
 Well you&#39;ll know afterward when I get mad.
 <br>
 Ok so uh is there a umm, you know, maybe a better system than that.
 <br>
 No, I can&#39;t really think of one, no.
 <br>
 Ok, fair enough.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 So uh, I blew off the guys tonight to hang out with you.
 <br>
 So my calendar is wide open.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here for you Donna.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hanging out with Jackie.
 <br>
 You can come if you want.
 <br>
 Hahaha, that&#39;s really not funny.
 <br>
