<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, guys? I&#39;m thinking about getting a perm.
 <br>
 Hyde, can I get the number of your guy? I don&#39;t have a &#39;&#39;guy,&#39;&#39; dumb-ass.
 <br>
 This righteous moss is a gift from God.
 <br>
 God gave me a perm, too, but he hit me below the belt.
 <br>
 What are you doing, Forman? My stupid Cousin Penny from Florida is coming this weekend so my mom&#39;s making me clean the basement.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 - Penny? - God, she was always such a tattletale.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Eric&#39;s stealing cookies.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Eric&#39;s playing with fire.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Eric&#39;s touching himself.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yeah, but Eric got her back.
 <br>
 He hit her with the old Ben Gay on the toothbrush and the over-the-shoulder wedgie and the butt-face gas attack.
 <br>
 - Butt-face gas attack? - I&#39;ll show you later.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 My favorite was when you trapped her in the revolving door at the library and kept spinning her.
 <br>
 Yeah, she ralphed and then she had to keep walking through the puddle.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause it&#39;s a revolving door.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) It spins in circles.
 <br>
 That&#39;s its nature.
 <br>
 It just- Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! - Penny! - Aunt Kitty! - It&#39;s so good to see you! - Oh, my gosh, you have grown so- Things have- Good for you! And good for us.
 <br>
 Oh, geez.
 <br>
 Penny.
 <br>
 You&#39;re so shiny.
 <br>
 I am just so excited you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 I have lots of free time these days, so I&#39;ve gathered up some local foliage.
 <br>
 And I thought we could have a long talk while we make our own potpourri! ( Laughing ) Well, thanks, Aunt Kitty, but right now I&#39;d just like to catch up with Eric.
 <br>
 Find out how he got so foxy.
 <br>
 Okay, you boys be nice.
 <br>
 But not too nice.
 <br>
 Penny, I know your last trip here I was kind of a jerk, and- Oh, God, Eric! That was so long ago.
 <br>
 Plus, I can&#39;t stay mad at you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re too cute.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) ( Laughing ) - Hey, guys, what&#39;s up? - Oh, hey, you remember my Cousin Penny? Hey, Penny.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t recognize you without Eric&#39;s butt in your face.
 <br>
 So, you guys ready for the movies? You can come too.
 <br>
 I guess.
 <br>
 Thanks, but this Wisconsin air is so dry I really should go inside and moisturize before I lose my tan.
 <br>
 I have lotion.
 <br>
 I think the best plan is for all of us to go to the movies- except for me and Penny, who will stay here and moisturize each other.
 <br>
 What? Screw that, I&#39;m gonna moisturize too.
 <br>
 - Michael! - I&#39;ll just do, like, a leg or something.
 <br>
 Fine! Come on.
 <br>
 Let me show you to your room.
 <br>
 - Michael! - I&#39;m gettin&#39; Kool-Aid! Damn! What losers! Did you see them checking her out? - Okay, she&#39;s not that hot.
 <br>
 - I never liked her.
 <br>
 You know, once when we were little she bit me, so I bit her back.
 <br>
 And then she said, &#39;&#39;Truce,&#39;&#39; so I said, &#39;&#39;Okay.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And then she bit me again.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Whore.
 <br>
 Slut.
 <br>
 - No, her.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Whore.
 <br>
 Yeah, we&#39;ll show Penny with our new sunlamp tans.
 <br>
 How dare she come into our town and try to &#39;&#39;out-hot&#39;&#39; us.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I mean, we don&#39;t go to her town and try and &#39;&#39;out-whore&#39;&#39; her.
 <br>
 Well, she can&#39;t just show up all hot, shaking her butt around our guys.
 <br>
 If our guys are gonna fantasize about moisturizing anybody, it should be us.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 But we&#39;re not gonna let them do that, are we? Let&#39;s just hope it doesn&#39;t come to that.
 <br>
 Have you seen that little stray cat that&#39;s been hanging around our house? Oh, yeah, I met him this morning.
 <br>
 Then he met the hose.
 <br>
 Kitty, we don&#39;t need more things hanging around our house.
 <br>
 We already have Steven and Kelso and &#39;&#39;foreign kid.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yeah, but they&#39;re always busy.
 <br>
 Maybe I should get my own cat.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not working.
 <br>
 I&#39;m home all day.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s my problem with cats.
 <br>
 Best-case scenario: You get the smartest cat in the world.
 <br>
 He still craps in your house.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s just, it would be nice to have something to take care of.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you what, Kitty.
 <br>
 Instead of getting a cat, why don&#39;t we all just stop flushing? It&#39;s the same thing! Guys, I&#39;m getting some weirdness from Cousin Penny.
 <br>
 Earlier, she gave me a hug, but this wasn&#39;t a cousin hug.
 <br>
 Our middles touched.
 <br>
 And not just for a second.
 <br>
 She pressed.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve heard of&#39;&#39;kissing cousins.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; But have you ever heard of&#39;&#39;doin&#39; it cousins&#39;&#39;? &#39;Cause that&#39;s what I think Forman should be shooting for here.
 <br>
 Kelso, I appreciate the advice, but your solution to every problem is &#39;&#39;do it with her.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Well, it worked with my old science teacher.
 <br>
 C-minus! Well, unfortunately, Penny is my cousin.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be like looking at my mom and thinking, &#39;&#39;Hey, baby, how&#39;&#39;- I&#39;m just gonna stop right there.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve thought that about your mom, but I didn&#39;t stop right there.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Surprise! This oughta keep you company during the week.
 <br>
 Roy&#39;s Pet Store? Red, you got me a cat! - Well, it&#39;s like a cat.
 <br>
 - ( Giggling ) A fish? Red, it&#39;s a fish.
 <br>
 See? It&#39;s like a cat.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re both pets.
 <br>
 - No, they&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Pets are called &#39;&#39;pets&#39;&#39; because you pet them.
 <br>
 How do I pet this thing? Well, you just reach in and corner it and give it a rub.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the thing about fish: They just love the feel of the human hand.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Jackie!Jackie, wake up.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;re totally burned.
 <br>
 Really? ( Gasps ) What have you done to me? Me? This was your stupid idea.
 <br>
 Did you call me &#39;&#39;stupid&#39;&#39;? - Ow! - Ow! - Lobster face! - Ow! Little Red Riding Bitch! ( Screams ) Oh, my God! Okay! Now, okay, let&#39;s just call a truce.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 - Ow! - Ow! - ( Squeals ) - Ow! Don&#39;t look at me.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Paul killed these.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 So must get pretty boring living in a fishbowl, huh? Gets pretty boring around here too.
 <br>
 You know, I used to work at a hospital, and taking care of people- ( Chuckling ) It felt so good to be needed.
 <br>
 You know, like-like part of a team? ( Gurgling ) You know, people really depended on me, which I kind of miss.
 <br>
 Oh, at least I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t miss the bedpans.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Are you sure it&#39;s okay for me to do my yoga in here? Do Aunt Kitty and Uncle Red allow girls in your room? Well, you&#39;re my cousin, so you don&#39;t even really count as a girl.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like a rock.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) A moving, talking, extremely limber rock.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Ooh, that&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - Peterson&#39;s Auto Shop.
 <br>
 - What? Peterson&#39;s Auto Shop.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what my T-shirt says.
 <br>
 I noticed you were trying to read it.
 <br>
 That&#39;s-Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I was.
 <br>
 I, uh- I kinda have, like, a passion for T-shirt logos.
 <br>
 ( Giggles ) Okay, well, bedtime for this logo fan, okay? ( Voice Cracking ) Off you go.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Naughty thoughts a-brewin&#39;.
 <br>
 ( Banjo:Bluegrass ) Penny, you&#39;re cold.
 <br>
 Go get a sweatshirt.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Okay, Uncle Red.
 <br>
 Eric, do I have to tell you to stop staring at your cousin? Stop staring at your cousin.
 <br>
 Kitty, where&#39;s breakfast? Honey, I&#39;m-I&#39;m running a little late.
 <br>
 I was, um, redecorating Fluffy&#39;s bowl.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Kitty, it&#39;s a stupid fish.
 <br>
 - What? - ( Groans ) Cinnamon toast, get on it! Oh, so, decided against the sweatshirt.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - It&#39;s a bold choice.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckling ) I saw Uncle Red leaving, and I wanted to talk to you alone.
 <br>
 See, I kind of have a crush on you.
 <br>
 Okay, Penny, okay.
 <br>
 ( Inhales Sharply ) Look, I don&#39;t know what the laws are down in Florida.
 <br>
 But up here, the cousin-lovin&#39; is really frowned upon.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I wanted to talk to you.
 <br>
 Last week, I overheard my parents talking, and I found out that I&#39;m adopted.
 <br>
 So, technically, we&#39;re not even related.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a twist.
 <br>
 And all those feelings that I had about you that would&#39;ve been wrong? Are pretty freakin&#39; right! - Bring it in.
 <br>
 - ( Sighs ) Now you&#39;re warm and I don&#39;t feel bad about that.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) So Penny&#39;s not even your cousin? All right.
 <br>
 Well, in light of recent developments, I vote &#39;&#39;do it.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Do it, yellow belly! Look, man, if you don&#39;t do it I&#39;m gonna do it.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;m gonna make fun of you.
 <br>
 All right, fellas.
 <br>
 I guess it&#39;s all systems go.
 <br>
 Just- Hey, let&#39;s keep this between us, okay? - Hey, what&#39;s up? - ( Ball Hits Backboard ) - Forman wants to nail his cousin.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No, no, no, she&#39;s not my cousin.
 <br>
 She was adopted.
 <br>
 And what the hell happened to your face? - What the hell happened to yours? - ( Mock Gasp ) Burn! Yeah, I gotta admit, Donna, that was a nice burn.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t mean what you said just there.
 <br>
 I mean your face.
 <br>
 Nice burn.
 <br>
 Hey, if you ever need a date for prom, you can just flip through the family album.
 <br>
 - ( Groans ) - Oh, God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just jealous because Penny is incredibly hot and you&#39;re a throbbing red pile.
 <br>
 Eric, my sunburn will fade, but your shame will last forever.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, at least my shame won&#39;t peel.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Hey, there&#39;s my girl.
 <br>
 New logo.
 <br>
 Nice.
 <br>
 I was just having a glass of milk before bed.
 <br>
 Oh, well, you know, you don&#39;t have to rush off.
 <br>
 Sit.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s gab awhile.
 <br>
 - ( Sighs ) - So let&#39;s get to the bottom of this crush, huh? You know what I&#39;d really love to do? Stay up late and watch movies like we did when we were kids.
 <br>
 Remember? All alone in the dark? That&#39;s a good plan.
 <br>
 - And let&#39;s wear our jammies! - Excellent addition to the plan.
 <br>
 Oh, but I usually just sleep in a T-shirt and panties.
 <br>
 Is that okay? Well, so do I! ( Laughs ) Er, I mean, you know, man-panties- Er- Underwear.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - You know what I meant.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 The movie starts at 1 1 :00.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t be late.
 <br>
 - Okay, I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Man-panties&#39;&#39;? - Kitty? What happened? - Fluffy died.
 <br>
 Well, if it&#39;s any consolation, fish are never even really alive.
 <br>
 They&#39;re just less dead.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 You know, he wasn&#39;t good company, but at least he was company.
 <br>
 - ( Sighs ) - Red, I&#39;m unhappy.
 <br>
 Oh! I gotta go to the store.
 <br>
 I am a nurturer.
 <br>
 I am not gonna be satisfied nurturing something you&#39;d win at a carnival.
 <br>
 Kitty, what do you want? I&#39;ll get you anything you want.
 <br>
 Not a cat.
 <br>
 - I want to go back to the hospital to work.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 As long as it&#39;s not a cat, I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 Okay, I think what you mean is, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing what makes you happy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, of course.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sorry that your fish died.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be.
 <br>
 I flushed it.
 <br>
 Good evening, milady.
 <br>
 Well, we&#39;re all alone.
 <br>
 I told Hyde to amscray for a while.
 <br>
 So go ahead, take off your robe.
 <br>
 Penny, there&#39;s no rat- Don&#39;t, Eric! Don&#39;t! - No, I was- - Eric, step away from your cousin.
 <br>
 No, she&#39;s not my cousin.
 <br>
 She was adopted.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not adopted.
 <br>
 - Wh-What? What? She&#39;s lying! Eric, I saw her mother give birth to her.
 <br>
 Now, what is going on? I&#39;m sleepwalking? And I&#39;m about to be &#39;&#39;sleepkicking&#39;&#39; your ass.
 <br>
 Eric, what kind of person would lie about something as serious as being adopted? A liar who specializes in adoption lies: You.
 <br>
 A mean, vindictive person.
 <br>
 - Like someone who would trap someone in a revolving door? - Yes! Ohh.
 <br>
 Mom, Dad, can- can Penny and I be alone for a minute? No! I&#39;m not raising any flipper grandkids.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Look, I just want to apologize to Penny.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 When you&#39;re done, you head right upstairs.
 <br>
 I&#39;m having Pastor Dave come over for an emergency house call.
 <br>
 I guess this will teach you to play pranks on innocent little girls.
 <br>
 This has taught me a lesson.
 <br>
 And that is that I&#39;m not gonna rest until I get you back way worse than you got me! Which by the way, wasn&#39;t really that bad! Actually, it&#39;s pretty bad.
 <br>
 ( Banjo:Bluegrass ) Cousin Penny went back home, huh? Oh, wait, did I say cousin? Yeah, I meant cousin.
 <br>
 Looks like that&#39;s two hot girls you can&#39;t have.
 <br>
 Well, thank you for such a conservative estimate.
 <br>
 - By the way, Donna, here&#39;s your copy of the pictures.
 <br>
 - Oh! If you flip through &#39;em real fast, it looks like Eric&#39;s running.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) - Gimme those.
 <br>
 ( Laughing )
