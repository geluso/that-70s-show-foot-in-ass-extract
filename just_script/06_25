 uh-huh.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Red! Cousin Alice wants to know why Eric and Donna&#39;s wedding is off.
 <br>
 Well, just tell her what your son did.
 <br>
 Oh, now he&#39;s my son, just like when he told us he wanted to be a jazz dancer.
 <br>
 Well, he&#39;s our son, red.
 <br>
 No son of mine would humiliate his family by running off on his fianc√©e.
 <br>
 Alice? The wedding is off because Eric is gay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Everybody knew except him.
 <br>
 Eric is a mental midget.
 <br>
 And you know what else? He runs like a girl.
 <br>
 Bob, you run like a girl.
 <br>
 Only when I&#39;m scared of something.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, I&#39;m sure Eric has a good explanation.
 <br>
 On the several occasions, I didn&#39;t show up for one of my weddings, I always called to say I had appendicitis.
 <br>
 Well, Eric&#39;s not here.
 <br>
 My little girl&#39;s unhappy, and I wanna punch somebody.
 <br>
 Bob, you don&#39;t want to fight.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve known you for a long time, and I know what you really want is a piece of cake.
 <br>
 A piece of cake, Kitty? My daughter is devastated, and you offer me cake? You just tell me one thing.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 is it chocolate? Devil&#39;s food.
 <br>
 I can have it on the table in less than a minute.
 <br>
 Eh.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do that, then.
 <br>
 Okay, um, guys, Donna&#39;s on her way over, and she knows we all know why Eric left, and she wants some answers.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not gonna tell her.
 <br>
 Give Donna bad news, and she hits.
 <br>
 She wasn&#39;t on the boys&#39; J.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Wrestling team for nothing.
 <br>
 Okay, well, I can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 The last person a girl wants to hear bad news from is a woman who has it all.
 <br>
 Well, you can count me out.
 <br>
 I won&#39;t face a girl when I ditch her.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna do it when somebody else does.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not telling her, either.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want my personal parts damaged.
 <br>
 I mean, they&#39;re practically brand-new.
 <br>
 Well, in a dead lock such as this, we&#39;re forced to turn to our judicial code, which clearly states, that in the event of bad news being delivered in reference to a cancelled wedding, the foreigner does it.
 <br>
 Ah, yes-- the immigration conversation act.
 <br>
 Where the hell is Eric, and why did he do this to me? Um, okay, um Eric was afraid getting married and staying here was a mistake you know, because you would be giving up your dream of traveling the world and becoming a ball-breaking feminist.
 <br>
 - Jackie, don&#39;t push! - You don&#39;t push! - Hey, hey.
 <br>
 Hey! Knock it off before Fez gets hurt.
 <br>
 Look, I just want to say that we&#39;re all really sorry.
 <br>
 How could Eric ditch me the night before our wedding without saying one word? Look, would it make you feel better if I told you that Eric left a note? - He left a note? - No.
 <br>
 But you should hold on to that feeling.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s show - Saison 6 - Episode 25 &#34;The Seeker&#34; Eric.
 <br>
 what a dink, right? You know, I had to call everybody and tell them the wedding&#39;s off.
 <br>
 The only good thing is, there&#39;s a rumor going around that he&#39;s gay, which is nice.
 <br>
 Look, man, I mean, I know you&#39;re mad, but you know, Forman was trying to do the right thing.
 <br>
 He just did it in the wrong way.
 <br>
 Yeah, but, Hyde, I don&#39;t care why he did it.
 <br>
 I mean, I can&#39;t ever forgive him.
 <br>
 When I called my mom, I just cried and cried.
 <br>
 Really? I can&#39;t see you crying.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve seen Forman crying.
 <br>
 He does a lot of &#34;shut up! I&#39;m not crying!&#34; - I want to be mad.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t make me laugh.
 <br>
 - Oh! Whoa! Oh, my god! Hyde, are you okay? I&#39;m too old for this crap! Why am I stronger than all the guys I hang out with? You look dorky.
 <br>
 Hyde, I am so sorry.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know my own strength.
 <br>
 I mean, I guess I&#39;m still all bulked up from J.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Wrestling.
 <br>
 You know what? This isn&#39;t my fault.
 <br>
 This is Eric&#39;s fault for taking off.
 <br>
 Hey, look at the bright side.
 <br>
 Now I can spy on you from Eric&#39;s empty bedroom instead of climbing up a tree where there&#39;s no place to put my juice box.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t believe I missed you falling out of the water tower.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m at home, and I&#39;m watching &#34;scooby-doo,&#34; and I think to myself, &#34;you know what? You should go and hang out with Hyde and Donna.
 <br>
 &#34; And then I think, &#34;no, because maybe scooby and shaggy found a real ghost this time.
 <br>
 &#34; But it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 It was just another crazy old guy.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, I heard what happened.
 <br>
 - And you brought me flowers? - No, these are for me.
 <br>
 My boyfriend fell off the water tower.
 <br>
 So what, Donna, you&#39;re alone, and you want me to be alone, too? Okay, Steven, get on home.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take care of you later.
 <br>
 Trade you a kiss for a lollipop.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need that baby crap.
 <br>
 Oh, look at all this glorious wedding food.
 <br>
 Do you, Fez, take this pizza roll? I do.
 <br>
 You know what part of falling off the water tower I like? The part right after you fall until the part where you hit the ground.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And then that part right after you crash where you&#39;re just kind of vibrating there? Oh, yeah! That was cool, too.
 <br>
 Yeah, and the second time you fall, it&#39;ll be even better, &#39;cause you know what to expect.
 <br>
 You know, so you can enjoy it, like, do a flip or something.
 <br>
 Oh, a flip would be awesome! Man, I&#39;m so glad you fell off the water tower.
 <br>
 Look at this.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s gone, and I&#39;m left with the flying stupid-ass-insky brothers.
 <br>
 - Mom? - MIDGE!! Oh, you sounded so sad on the phone, I just had to come.
 <br>
 We missed you so much.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Donna, quit hogging your mom! I know something very interesting about someone we know very well.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 None of your supermarket gossip.
 <br>
 If half of what you say is true, everybody in this town would have V.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 Well, I was going over Steven&#39;s file when he was at the hospital, and you know his father? I believe I had the pleasure of him writing me a hot check.
 <br>
 Of course, in his defense, he was drunk.
 <br>
 Well, Well, according to Steven&#39;s birth certificate, that&#39;s not his father.
 <br>
 This is so exciting! Steven has a different father that he doesn&#39;t know about-- maybe a nice father.
 <br>
 Maybe a sober father.
 <br>
 Well, we don&#39;t want him to be entirely sober.
 <br>
 You know how those people are.
 <br>
 Mom, I can&#39;t tell you how much it means to me that you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Well, there are times when a mother has to be there for her baby, like now and, I guess, when she&#39;s born.
 <br>
 You know, Mrs.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, in my younger days, I had quite the crush on you even though I knew nothing could ever happen.
 <br>
 But now that I&#39;m older, and I&#39;m gonna be a father soon, if anything does happen, we gotta keep it quiet.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re late.
 <br>
 Where.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Midge! Hey.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 what a surprise.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 I should probably return these earrings I didn&#39;t know were yours.
 <br>
 Midge, what are you doing here? I came to see Donna.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s the amazon? Oh, this is my, uh, friend.
 <br>
 &#34;Friend&#34;? I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 Hi, I&#39;m Pam, the best thing that ever happened to him.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Midge, the second best thing that ever happened to him.
 <br>
 Dad, I invited her to stay with us.
 <br>
 Your mom is staying with us? No, your mom is staying with us.
 <br>
 - What about my mom? - Well, that&#39;s not my mom, that&#39;s your mom.
 <br>
 I&#39;m confused.
 <br>
 Who am I sleeping with? Steven, we need to talk to you about something pretty important.
 <br>
 Look, whatever you found in my room was planted there.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 We.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - what&#39;s in your room? - Red, stay focused.
 <br>
 - Yeah, stay focused.
 <br>
 All right, Steven, just for the record, I told her to mind her own business, and then she said, &#34;fine, you can make your own dinner.
 <br>
 &#34; So.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 ha ha.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 here we are.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Steven, we found out that the man you think is your father isn&#39;t really your father.
 <br>
 Your real father&#39;s name is William Barnett, and he lives in Milwaukee.
 <br>
 Oh, my god! Steven, this is so exciting! You have a whole new family, which is great, because I hate your family! Steven, I know you have a lot of feelings and emotions, and maybe you want to cry.
 <br>
 We won&#39;t tell if you cry.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t like guys that cry.
 <br>
 Will you two please? Steven, are you okay? Well, I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 don&#39;t really know the guy who&#39;s supposed to be my dad, and obviously, I don&#39;t know this new guy, - .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 so I don&#39;t really care.
 <br>
 - Oh, but, Steven, you have to care! What if your new dad is something amazing like a doctor or the guy who owns &#34;the love boat&#34;? That didn&#39;t go well.
 <br>
 What did you want to happen? Well, I thoughthe would be happy to hear about his dad.
 <br>
 We all go to Milwaukee, and then his his rich, new father would be so thrilled to see him, he&#39;d buy me a fur coat.
 <br>
 Bob, could you pass the syrup? You&#39;re gonna give her the syrup? The syrup we share every morning? The syrup that stands for everything that we are as a man and a woman? I was gonna but I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 I will later.
 <br>
 No, I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going? Your father&#39;s an ass.
 <br>
 Oh, something we agree on.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not going that well.
 <br>
 Okay, I find this whole thing very disturbing.
 <br>
 I was left at the altar, and all I can think about is what&#39;s my dad doing, who&#39;s he doing it with and if I walk through that door, am I gonna see it? Well, whatever he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s doing with me, and we&#39;re doing it everywhere, so.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 knock.
 <br>
 So after we left, Steven said he didn&#39;t want to talk about his new dad in Milwaukee, and he didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 And he wasn&#39;t not talking about it to be bitchy, like I would.
 <br>
 He really didn&#39;t want to talk about it.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t like the way he just walked out after we told him the news.
 <br>
 Why would he do that? Because he&#39;s a man, Kitty and he knows you want him to cry, but he won&#39;t, because crying is for babies and Italians.
 <br>
 And I think we all just need to stay outta his business.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re all dressed up.
 <br>
 are you gonna propose? No.
 <br>
 I, uh I thought I&#39;d head out to Milwaukee.
 <br>
 By yourself? Yeah, I guess.
 <br>
 So I&#39;ll see you guys later, then.
 <br>
 Well, uh we were just, uh, talking about going to Milwaukee.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 for their famous honey buns.
 <br>
 Well, you guys could come along, I guess.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure in the mood for a.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 honey bun.
 <br>
 And to see baby go home to his daddy! So midge wanted you to pass the syrup and Pam wouldn&#39;t let you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s interesting.
 <br>
 What do you think it means? I think it means you got a shot at something only rock stars and professional athletes get.
 <br>
 Free passes to Disneyland? No, Fez, two ladies at the same time.
 <br>
 Ah, screw Disneyland.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a much better ride.
 <br>
 Think I could really keep both of them? May I say from experience, when you&#39;re dealing with two ladies, the end won&#39;t be pretty, but the ride down is super fun.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do, mom.
 <br>
 I mean, I always thought Eric and I would be together, and he blew it.
 <br>
 - Maybe you&#39;ll work it out.
 <br>
 - Well, I don&#39;t want to work it out.
 <br>
 I want to push his face in the dirt like we did when we were kids.
 <br>
 You know what? I never should have stopped doing that.
 <br>
 Donna, just forgive him.
 <br>
 How? Give me one good reason.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, I can&#39;t give you a rational reason.
 <br>
 There probably isn&#39;t one.
 <br>
 But if you love him, and you don&#39;t want to be without him, you have to forgive him.
 <br>
 I was too hard headed to forgive your father, and I wish I had.
 <br>
 Aw, Midge.
 <br>
 - You want to take a walk? - Sure! I&#39;ll drive.
 <br>
 Did you see that? Maybe someone will have a happy ending.
 <br>
 And then another beginning and another ending, because he&#39;s got two ladies! Bob Pinciotti, a street kid outta nowhere, gets a shot at the title.
 <br>
 You know what? He&#39;s like.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 He&#39;s like the rocky of bagging two ladies.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a big day, meeting your father for the first time.
 <br>
 - Mmm.
 <br>
 - You bet.
 <br>
 A big day for my big guy, huh? - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 - So how you doing? I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Oh, you doing all right, baby? Just quit! Stop! Stop! Keep it down.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t your parole office.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Barnett will see you now.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 This is it.
 <br>
 Jackie, here&#39;s the camera.
 <br>
 Take a picture of Steven the minute he sees his father.
 <br>
 If he cries, and you miss it, I will hurt you.
 <br>
 Um, where&#39;s Steven? He left.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I saw him go, and I didn&#39;t say anything on purpose.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 - Kitty! - I came all this way.
 <br>
 I want my fur coat.
 <br>
 - Who&#39;s there? Who&#39;s there? - Ow! Ow! Jeez, Donna, stop! Oh, god.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know it was you.
 <br>
 - You dirtbag! How could you do that? You just left me there! - I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I freaked out, okay? I tried to talk to you about it, but I couldn&#39;t, and I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 All I knew was that I Donna, I think we were about to make a huge mistake.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know what you mean.
 <br>
 I had a bad feeling, too.
 <br>
 But here&#39;s the difference.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I stayed.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, please please forgive me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I mean, my mom said I should, but I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Listen to me.
 <br>
 I am so sorry.
 <br>
 Okay, whatever you want to do, we&#39;ll do, okay? Just.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 just tell me what to do.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll figure it out tomorrow.
 <br>
 Just get in.
 <br>
 Really? Won&#39;t you let me walk you home from school thanks for coming back.
 <br>
 Won&#39;t you let me meet you at the pool? If it&#39;s so well, let me know I just want to say let me know, well, I can go and I&#39;ll take you that was beautiful.
 <br>
 What the Glad you&#39;re back.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a bill for the wedding you didn&#39;t show up for.
 <br>
 $6,000? Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 I added on a grand for pain and suffering.
 <br>
 Thanks, daddy.
 <br>
 Buy yourself something nice with it.
 <br>
 I suggest a new boyfriend.
 <br>
 Okay !
