 Previously on That 70&#39;s Show Wow, uhm you&#39;re gonna take a job and move to Chicago ? Well, I&#39;m willing to give it all up and stay here with you.
 <br>
 But if I do that, I need to know we&#39;re gonna get married.
 <br>
 Well I don&#39;t know what to say right now She took the job in Chicago and she left this morning.
 <br>
 Check check check, no one can see us doing it from the parking loAAAAHHH ! You&#39;re dead ! I&#39;m NUDE ! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, what a great idea making a tape to send to Eric in Africa ! Oh please, I am full of great ideas ! When he went to camp, I sent him a huge card with my face on it that says &#34;Mommy loves you&#34;.
 <br>
 Well it made him miss me so much he begged to come home the very next day.
 <br>
 Ah yes, the summer of a thousand wedgies Eric is gonna be so excited to hear some familiar voices.
 <br>
 OH ! I do Porky Pig Hababadahababada, that is all people ! Is Hyde here ?! No Michael, you&#39;re safe.
 <br>
 We still haven&#39;t heard from Steven since he left Chicago a month ago.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing here.
 <br>
 Hyde could show up any minute and kick my ass.
 <br>
 I really need a soda cause I just ate a whole bunch of salt.
 <br>
 Why is it so good ? I don&#39;t know, why don&#39;t you ask Hyde, he is right behind you HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! It&#39;s not even funny ! Okay then, let&#39;s start the tape Hi Eric, it&#39;s your mother.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here with Donna and Fez.
 <br>
 Hi honey ! Thank you for the postcard with the monkeys.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still bananas about you too ! Okay, let&#39;s see, where to start well your father and I were furious when we caught you boys in that smokey basement.
 <br>
 The minute you left the airport we went down there to do what the Fed&#39;s call &#39;a sweep&#39; How dare you boys smoke up my house when you know how hard I work to keep it smelling lemony-fresh ! You morons just hung vacancy-signs on your asses ! And my foot is looking for a room ! - Here it is ! - Here it is ! TWO bags ? I&#39;ve never seen those before in my life ! Your son has a real problem ! Kitty, I want you to take this garbage and flush it down the toilet ! I am just glad that we caught you boys before this became an every day thing ! Is that all of it ? Yes sir, that&#39;s all of it.
 <br>
 Now there is nothing left for us to do but to smoke Candyland.
 <br>
 I mean, I mean play Canysmoke I mean Aiii no ! And so I flushed it all down the toilet and everyone learned a lesson Why don&#39;t you tell Eric what else happened ? - Oeh let me, let me ! - Give me that ! I&#39;ll tell him Kitty ! I found another one ! Kitty ? What the hell ?! What do you have to say for yourself ?! I&#39;m STARVING ! That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 8 Episodes 01 et Traduction par Yvan et Merci Ã  &#34;site source&#34; I still can&#39;t believe Red caught you in the bathroom with the guys stash.
 <br>
 Someone is getting a tye-dyed apron for their birthday ! No, I just I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.
 <br>
 I mean I was skeptical about tupperware and that was lifechanging ! Anyway Eric, I suffered the consequences, your father gave me a very stern talking to.
 <br>
 Kitty when we got married, we took a vow.
 <br>
 To be together through sickness and in health.
 <br>
 But nobody said anything about what to do if your wife turns into a dope fiend ! You&#39;re a nurse for God&#39;s sake ! You know this stuff is bad news ! Bad news isn&#39;t the half of it ! Here are the facts: when the smoke hits the brain, the cells start dying.
 <br>
 This process causes impaired judgement and hallucinations and a lot of other wonderful things Is it Eric going away ? Is that why you used this stuff ? Kitty, if you were feeling blue, you didn&#39;t have to turn to drugs ! I would have made you a Martini ! What&#39;s so damn funny ?! Is it the big head thing ? I hardly felt a thing.
 <br>
 You ate a whole box of uncooked spaghetti.
 <br>
 Anyway Eric, the day you left, Steven went to Chicago to see Jackie .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 when he got there, he walked in on Jackie and Kelso who were about to Get  busy.
 <br>
 Have sex Doooooo iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit ! Kelso told us the whole story when he got back the next day.
 <br>
 No, hardly anything happened okay.
 <br>
 Jackie asked me to stay cause she was lonely.
 <br>
 The next thing you know, I&#39;m naked.
 <br>
 And then Hyde shows up and kicks me out the door and so I had to drive all the way back here in this dress that I found.
 <br>
 All the truckers were flashing their lights and honking their horns.
 <br>
 It was pretty great.
 <br>
 Man Hyde is gonna kick your ass.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I gotta get out of here before someone kicks the crap out of me YOU JERK ! HEY hey ! Watch the face ! That&#39;s the paycheck ! Jackie, aren&#39;t you supposed to be in Chicago ?! Well  I&#39;m here to get Steven back.
 <br>
 Uhh, where is he ? Oh he&#39;s not here.
 <br>
 He took off after he caught you two about to DOOOO IIIIIT ! Oh my God, this is horrible.
 <br>
 I quit my job, I lost my boyfriend.
 <br>
 My whole life is ruined.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m really sorry about what happened.
 <br>
 I never meant to come between you and Hyde.
 <br>
 Let me ask you one question, are we back together or not ? Oh you are just as dumb as ever ! Okay,  you know you can insult me all you want but just answer the question ! NO ! No you won&#39;t answer the question ?! Why not ? Because we&#39;re not together ! THAT&#39;S the reason you won&#39;t answer the question ?! NOOOOOO ! THEN WHAT&#39;S THE REASON ? .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 and that went on for abouthalf an hour.
 <br>
 Oh hey Kitty.
 <br>
 I need to borrow some butter or oil.
 <br>
 Pretty much anything greasy.
 <br>
 Are you cooking ? Nope, tanning.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s up with the tape recorder ? Oh, I&#39;m making a tape to send to Eric.
 <br>
 Here, - say hi ! - Don&#39;t give him the microphone ! What&#39;s new pussycat What&#39;s new pussy.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Ai Donna ! Boo ! Boo ! Dad, just say something normal.
 <br>
 Normal doesn&#39;t put asses in the seats Donna.
 <br>
 For the last time, there are no seats anywhere around here ! Oh Red honey, here, say something to Eric ! I&#39;d love to Son, I was out in the garage the other day.
 <br>
 I looked down and I saw your old baseball mitt.
 <br>
 And it made me think what I always think.
 <br>
 What a waste of money Actually Eric, you leaving was very hard on your father.
 <br>
 The next day he just sat around, moping.
 <br>
 I feel like dancing ! By the way Eric, we gave some of your toys to the church ! Give up Eric ? That&#39;s a deck of cards hitting a bottle of soy sauce.
 <br>
 Eric, please come home.
 <br>
 You have no idea how much I miss you.
 <br>
 I miss you too honey.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be happy until I see you again.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 STEVEN&#39;S HOME ! Okay Miss Kitty, he doesn&#39;t like to be hugged ! Don&#39;t you ever leave me again ! I spilled my sodaHiiiiiii.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to say man.
 <br>
 What about &#34;Ow&#34; ? Why would I say ow ? I get it ! Eric, Steven just hit Michael.
 <br>
 And while I&#39;m very disappointed in Steven for hitting Michael, it was very exciting ! Come on man, get up.
 <br>
 Why ? So you can deck me again ? Actually I&#39;m fine now.
 <br>
 Everything I wanted to say was in that one punch.
 <br>
 Come on It was a good one too.
 <br>
 Peed myself a little on the way down.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go change Hyde, where have you been ? Uh I&#39;ve been hanging out in Las Vegas my man.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ve learned this: you don&#39;t wanna show up late to a Don Rickles Show with puffy hair.
 <br>
 Well, you could have let us know where you were.
 <br>
 I was worried sick about you and I am very I got you this A little tiny slotmachine ! It is so cute Steven you&#39;re back ! Look, we have to talk.
 <br>
 About what ? How you nailed Kelso ? No, about our relationship.
 <br>
 Oh okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll startYou nailed Kelso ! You never gave me a chance to explain ! BECAUSE YOU NAILED KELSO ! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, start taping ! Eric loves it when he screams at her ! Steven I never even slept with Michael.
 <br>
 Yeah right because Kelso is always showing up at my hotelroom naked with a bucket of ice.
 <br>
 You know this is your fault too.
 <br>
 Okay you two, just stop yelling ! Go ahead.
 <br>
 No forget it.
 <br>
 Well I guess that&#39;s that.
 <br>
 Well that was horrible.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Where the hell is my little tiny slotmachine Red can you please just do me a favour and tell Eric you miss him a little ? Oh fine.
 <br>
 Give me the thing Eric, this is a little hard for me cause I&#39;m not real emotional but I wanted to tell you that you GI Joe&#39;s were killed.
 <br>
 In the great Dumpster-war of 1979 Well your meatloaf was lost in the great &#34;Make-your-own-dinner-war&#34; of 19-TODAY ! Well Eric, now that I have a second, I should catch you up on your new friend Charlie.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Who brought the beer ? I thought you were bringing the beer.
 <br>
 No, you were bringing beer, I was chips.
 <br>
 YOU&#39;RE bringing beer, I was chips.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Give me the chips.
 <br>
 I forgot the chips.
 <br>
 You guys How much do we love this guy ? He&#39;s a prince ! Charlie, it is so awesome hanging out with you.
 <br>
 Ah thanks guys, it feels so good to finally belong to something you know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like the first day of the rest of my life ! THE BEER ! That was a pretty awkward landing I hope he&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Of course he&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like anyone ever died falling off the watertower.
 <br>
 And so they renamed it the Charlie Richardson Memorial Watertower.
 <br>
 Jackie, Hyde just needed to blow off some steam, you guys aren&#39;t over.
 <br>
 Well if you won&#39;t talk to me, then maybe you&#39;ll talk to Mr.
 <br>
 Fluffycakes Jackie ! My magical horn senses that you&#39;re sad and you need someone to talk to ! Great.
 <br>
 Now  he can&#39;t hear you Hey Jackie.
 <br>
 Oh, what do you want ? Man, I feel really bad about the way things turned out.
 <br>
 You and Hyde should be together okay.
 <br>
 Go talk to him.
 <br>
 Look there is no point okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m starting to think Steven never really wanted to be with me at all.
 <br>
 This must be how ugly people feel all the time.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t know about the ugly thing.
 <br>
 But I do know that he does wanna be with you.
 <br>
 Why else would he drive all the way to Chicago to propose to you ? Wait, what ?! Oh my God ! Steven was gonna propose ?! I have to find him ! Tell you what, that&#39;s the last time I wanna mess around with a girl with a boyfriend.
 <br>
 Kelso, your hand is on my butt.
 <br>
 Come on he&#39;s in Africa ! You know Red, it really upset me this afternoon when you wouldn&#39;t say anything nice to Eric.
 <br>
 Well I can see how that would surprise you, what with nice things always bubbling out of my mouth.
 <br>
 Well  it would just mean a lot to me to hear you say how you feel.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you even miss him ? Well let&#39;s say I did.
 <br>
 I still wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable saying it on tape.
 <br>
 Well would it kill you just to say it to me here in private ? Oh fine ! I miss him ! Of course I miss him.
 <br>
 He&#39;s my son Why do you always make me say things ?! Yeah I should be in the FBI.
 <br>
 So anyway Forman, ramble on, keep on keeping on, most of all my friend, rock on.
 <br>
 You know, I never used to understand that hippie-jargon, but ever since my &#34;bathroom-experiment&#34;, I&#39;m cool man ! Oeh, let me just give you two some privacy Hey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Steven I am so sorry about what happened in Chicago.
 <br>
 I was alone and I thought I lost you.
 <br>
 Yeah well, I can see why you thought that.
 <br>
 Look why didn&#39;t you tell me sooner you wanted to get married ? Because I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to.
 <br>
 And now that I&#39;ve thought about it, I&#39;m right, I&#39;m not ready to be married yet.
 <br>
 Yet ? Oh, okay.
 <br>
 Well there you have it Eric, Steven&#39;s not ready to get married yet.
 <br>
 Hi I&#39;m looking for HYDE ! Hey baby ! HeySam.
 <br>

 <br>
 She&#39;s a st exotic dancer I met in Vegas.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, what are you doing here ? You don&#39;t remember ? We got married.
 <br>
 - OH MY GOD ! - WHAT ? One more thing Eric, Steven married a stripper ! Being up here makes me think of my poor friend Billy.
 <br>
 His name was Charlie you cantaloup.
 <br>
 Kelso you&#39;ve fallen off this thing like ten times.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so scary to think you could haveyou know, like, met the same fate as Charlie.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we go through our lives like thinking we&#39;re invincible right, but the truth is we&#39;re totally &#39;vincible THUD SCREW THAT ! I&#39;M INVINCIBLE ! Oh my God, what did I do You married a Las Vegas stripper.
 <br>
 Congratulations.
 <br>
 With Eric gone, you&#39;re the town dumbass ! Steven, how could you get married and not remember ? It&#39;s not like forgetting where you left your keys or where you parked your car or your tenth anniversary Kitty that was thirteen years ago ! Fifteen.
 <br>
 Has it been that long ? I don&#39;t know what happened, I mean, Samantha and I hung out for three weeks, and then one night we got really drunk and I remember waking up with a killer hangover, thinking I better get out of Vegas before I&#39;d do something stupid So close ! Here are some pictures of our wedding We found this beautiful little chapel called &#34;Weddings and Waffles&#34;.
 <br>
 We got married by an Elvis impersonator ?! Oeh  and look at his name ! Elvis Priestly.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that clever ? Wow, that must have been some wedding.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not too often that you see the bride jump out of her own cake.
 <br>
 Oh man, it&#39;s starting to come back to me.
 <br>
 I remember seeing a cross and an altar.
 <br>
 But I thought I was having that Excorcist-dream again.
 <br>
 WHERE&#39;S THE STRIPPER ? THERE SHE IS ! THERE IS A STRIPPER IN THE KITCHEN ! AM I YELLING ? I CAN&#39;T HELP IT ! OOOOOOH HYDE YOU MARRIED A STRIPPER I LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH You must be Kelso.

 <br>
 You married a stripper ! You&#39;re living every guys dream ! Well not my dream, my dream is always the same, monkey gives me the finger and flaps his lips at me and takes off with my clothes.
 <br>
 Trust me, you don&#39;t wanna live that dream.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the store doing closed in the middle of the day ? Maybe it&#39;s Rosh Hashanah.
 <br>
 Hey dude, pull up a pillow.
 <br>
 Leo, what the hell did you do with my record store ? Record store ? You know now that you mention it, this place would make an awesome record store.
 <br>
 I left you in charge and you turned my store into a hippy den for your stoner friends ?! That&#39;s not true man.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know any of these people.
 <br>
 Leo, I&#39;m not in the mood for this today.
 <br>
 Just get these people out of here alright.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in my office Leo there is an ORGY in my office ! I can&#39;t the boys from the girls it&#39;s hair everywhere ! Man.
 <br>
 This is no way to spend Rosh Hashanah.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Hyde.
 <br>
 I mean he completely broke Jackie&#39;s heart.
 <br>
 Who just goes and marries a stripper ? What are you, dense ? Anybody who can, that who.
 <br>
 Okay, get dressed.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going out.
 <br>
 But it doesn&#39;t really matter what you wear, because everyone is gonna be looking at me.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t wear that.
 <br>
 Wow Jackie.
 <br>
 After everything you&#39;ve been through with Hyde, you come here and insult me ?! You&#39;re all better ! Well I&#39;m not gonna sit around moping.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna do what every woman does when they hit rock bottom.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going to have sex with me ?! No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to go out and meet some boys, and crush their hearts one by one.
 <br>
 You know Donna, Eric is in Africa.
 <br>
 Must be close to hitting rock bottom Not really.
 <br>
 How long has a boy have to wait before one of floosies hits rock bottom ? Oh.
 <br>
 Samantha.
 <br>
 You&#39;re painting your toes in the kitchen.
 <br>
 That&#39;s funny because I was just making meatloaf in the bathroom.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Hyde told me how much he likes painted toes.
 <br>
 He told me some other things that he liked but I said: Hey I&#39;m a stripper not a contortionist.
 <br>
 Well isn&#39;t that just more then a mother wants to hear.
 <br>
 Okay so, I&#39;m curious.
 <br>
 What is your act like ? Do you sing ? No I just dance.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well when I was younger, I took tap.
 <br>
 Do you do tap ? No funny that you should mention it, I strip to taps ! You mean the song they play when an army man dies ?! Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my tribute to our armed forces.
 <br>
 I wave the American flag and then for the big finish, I give a salute and the I smack my fanny Sorry I No I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 This thing has a mind of it&#39;s own Red, I&#39;m not sure how I feel about having a stripper stay in our home.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, what&#39;s the word, an abomination ! I don&#39;t think Steven even knew what he was doing when he married her.
 <br>
 It sounds like he was as schnockered as you were on St.
 <br>
 Patricks Day.
 <br>
 Okay well that green punch sneaks right up on you ! I think Steven has made a huge mistake.
 <br>
 But what are we gonna do ? Kick Sam out ? Oh we will do no such thing.
 <br>
 You will ! Oh fine.
 <br>
 But the next time you hit a deer, you&#39;re the one putting it out of it&#39;s misery with it&#39;s tyre iron ! Well well, another day in the life of Point Place police officer.
 <br>
 I just confiscated a whole box of lighters, paraphernalia and illegal substances ice work officer.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;re hooked up for two months.
 <br>
 So what do we do now Man I think I have to fire Leo.
 <br>
 He almost put me out of business.
 <br>
 Just wish there was a good way to do it This is definitely gooder.
 <br>
 Gooder ? Yeah that&#39;s a word.
 <br>
 Leo, I left you in charge of the store and you let me down man.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m sorry to have to say you&#39;re fired man ! I think the word you&#39;re looking for is &#39;fried&#39; man And I am.
 <br>
 No no man I mean you&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 That&#39;s even funnier man ! And I totally deserve it.
 <br>
 Yeah and you&#39;re under arrest too ! What ?! I&#39;m just kidding.
 <br>
 These handcuffs don&#39;t even work, look wait, these are the ones that DO work Hey, I saw this Help Wanted sign outside.
 <br>
 You still looking ? Errrrr, Leo were you trying to hire somebody ? You know yesterday I was having a hard time opening up a jar of pickles so I put the Help Wanted sign up.
 <br>
 Too late man, I found something else to eat.
 <br>
 Why do they make the lid so tight ? It&#39;s just pickles ! So you&#39;re not hiring ? That&#39;s a bummer.
 <br>
 Cause I gotta say, if this is your idea of a staff meeting, I&#39;d work my butt off ! What the hell man, I&#39;m in a giving mood right now.
 <br>
 You can have the job and do all the work that Leo wasn&#39;t doing.
 <br>
 And Leo I can&#39;t fire you man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re too awesome.
 <br>
 New guy, you&#39;re hired.
 <br>
 Leo you&#39;re not fired, jobs for everyone.
 <br>
 Well that was hard but it had to be done.
 <br>
 Wow Jackie, that is quite an outfit.
 <br>
 Does it come with a pimp ? Donna, this is my man-catcher dress ! It is scientifically designed to make men want me, while at the same time knowing they could never really have me.
 <br>
 Oh everyone loves a tease Oh he is cute and smiling ! I&#39;m gonna go and make him wish he was dead ! Can I ask you a question ? Yes, I&#39;m available.
 <br>
 But not to you ! HA ! BURN ! Oh my God that was so much fun, I wanna do another one ! Actually I just wanted to know your hot blond friend&#39;s name Oh I don&#39;t have a hot blond friend.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just here with Fez and Donna.
 <br>
 Donna ? Thanks ! Wait, wait, what, you like Donna ?! She reads books for fun ! Hi, I&#39;m Mark.
 <br>
 Wow, you have one of the prettiest smiles I&#39;ve ever seen.
 <br>
 Oh thank you ! Well the secret is to brush with baking soda ! Actually I was talking to Donna.
 <br>
 Wow, you are just gorgeous.
 <br>
 Really ? Yeah you know Donna means &#39;lady&#39; in Italian.
 <br>
 And Belladonna means &#39;fine lady&#39;, and you, you are definitely one fine lady.
 <br>
 What&#39;s Italian for &#39;keep going&#39; ? Wanna play a little pool ? Oh I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I have a boyfriend.
 <br>
 He&#39;s in Africa.
 <br>
 Well he is just missing out on how beautiful you look.
 <br>
 La mia fiora bella.
 <br>
 Italian ! Can you believe that ?! Ah don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 You still got me.
 <br>
 Hi, I&#39;m Kim.
 <br>
 Dance with me.
 <br>
 So long lame-o ! Hey Samantha, you should have seen your dopey husband today.
 <br>
 He was supposed to fire Leo, but then he wussed out and hired a new guy too.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like the time I went to break up with this chick and I ended up doing it with her AND her mom.
 <br>
 I understand why you couldn&#39;t fire anyone.
 <br>
 On the outside you&#39;re rough and cynical, but underneath is all you&#39;re just a sweet curly-haired boy who likes to be tickled.
 <br>
 Really ?! Kelso, if you try to tickle me, I swear to God I rip off your arm and tickle the bloody hole with your own hand.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll figure out what to do honey, you have great instincts.
 <br>
 You have a great butt too, but that&#39;s a whole other thing She is awesome.
 <br>
 Hey Sam, let me ask you a question about being a stripper.
 <br>
 Can I see your boobs ? Oh Samantha.
 <br>
 You&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Did Red talk to you by any chance ? Mr.
 <br>
 Forman ? No.
 <br>
 Why ? Oh.
 <br>
 Well.
 <br>
 Uhhm.
 <br>
 &#34;What&#39;s that ? Be right there Eric !&#34; Then my psychiatrist said the reason I always want sex is because I never got apporoval from my parents so I&#39;m trying to find it somewhere else.
 <br>
 Do you think he&#39;s right ? Dear God I hope so ! Who does that guy think he is rejecting me like that ?! I am the hottest girl here ! Right Fez ? Hey you ! Mark is it ? Yeah.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re from.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ll have you know, I am the catch of Point Place.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how she signed my yearbook.
 <br>
 Ah come back here ! Nobody ignores Jerky Backhart ! I am adorable ! I am engaging and I&#39;m DAMN likeable.
 <br>
 And if you&#39;re too stupid to see that, then I feel sorry for you ! Cause if anyone should be the center of attention here, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Jackie ! Get off me ! What the hell is a &#34;boobs out&#34; ? Okay, your turn ! Ah Samantha, there you are, good.
 <br>
 Hi Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I was just unpacking.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t these cute ? Oh ! I mean you can&#39;t tell like this.
 <br>
 You have to picture them like this Plus they hold dollar bills better then anything I own.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going upstairs to find you a wallet ! Hey Randy, come here.
 <br>
 I want to talk to you.
 <br>
 Yeah sure, but check this out first See these guys over there ? They think Leo is an Almond brother.
 <br>
 - Why would they think that ? - I told them ! Wow, Leo is an Almond brother ?! Yeah man.
 <br>
 We were overstocked with Almond Brothers albums.
 <br>
 So I figured meeting one of the guys of the band would put people in a buying mood.
 <br>
 And it totally worked ! And Leo&#39;s up for this ? Oh he has no idea what is going on.
 <br>
 I meanat all.
 <br>
 He&#39;s really out of it.
 <br>
 You know now that you mention it, if we give him a hat and some sunglasses we could probably use him to move some ZZ Top ! Yeah.
 <br>
 Your friend here might be pretty enough to pass of as Cher.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not a bad idea Andy Gibb ! So what did you want to talk to me about ? Oh.
 <br>
 I guess I just wanted to congratulate you on your new job here at the record store.
 <br>
 I name you senior vice-president in charge of scams.
 <br>
 Alright man ! Man, I can&#39;t fire Leo.
 <br>
 He&#39;s like a father to me.
 <br>
 Well like a friend.
 <br>
 Well he&#39;s like a guy who always has lighter.
 <br>
 Whoho.
 <br>
 So if you&#39;re not gonna fire Randy, and you&#39;re not gonna fire Leo, I got a question.
 <br>
 Can I see your wife boobs ? Hey guys, guess what.
 <br>
 One of the Almond Brothers is here ! This new guy Randy is awesome ! Today he was looking over the records, and he figured out it be easier to find things if we just alphabetized them.
 <br>
 Hey, do you know what you were doing just now ? No, what ? Telling your wife about your day.
 <br>
 Pretty cool huh ? Didn&#39;t suck.
 <br>
 Oh good.
 <br>
 You&#39;re both here.
 <br>
 We want to talk to you about your marriage.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;ve come to think of you as a son, and so I want to give you some honest, hartfelt advise.
 <br>
 Get your head out of your ass.
 <br>
 You two barely know eachother.
 <br>
 Not to mention that I saw a TV movie where someone like you moved in and killed the whole family.
 <br>
 Steven honey, if this isn&#39;t what you want, you should say so now.
 <br>
 Yeah, you should.
 <br>
 Hyde, if you don&#39;t want me here, I&#39;ll pack up my things and leave tonight.
 <br>
 No man, it&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 Okay then.
 <br>
 Oh she&#39;s staying.
 <br>
 Well Well I guess I&#39;ll go set an extra place at the table for strippersupper ! You&#39;re never gonna believe this ! I drove here this way.
 <br>
 Jackie, will you please come out ? I don&#39;t think even anyone saw you.
 <br>
 OH MY GOD ! I&#39;m sorry about my friend, she&#39;s a little prudish.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not as free with her body as I hope you will be.
 <br>
 Ready to go baby ? Hey buddy, the only guy she is leaving with is me ! Unless you just wanna do it in the bathroom, then we can leave separately.
 <br>
 Fez, there is something I need to tell you.
 <br>
 Mark and I are married.
 <br>
 What ? Yeah we come here every weekend and watch eachother hit on strangers.
 <br>
 It makes for some ultra hot action when we get back home ! Wait, yeah Eric and I tried that once.
 <br>
 I got three phone numbers and he got the highscore on Space Invaders.
 <br>
 Wait, you do this every weekend ?! You shower some poor loser with affection and then toss him aside when you&#39;re done ?! Yeah.
 <br>
 See you next weekend I gotta say, Sam is pretty cool.
 <br>
 Yeah ? Yeah yesterday for no reason at all, she grabbed a beer out of the fridge and just like gave it to me.
 <br>
 I mean what is that all about ? Maybe that is what husbands and wives do for eachother ? Craziest damn thing I ever saw.
 <br>
 Uhm Steven ? I just wanna let you know that we&#39;re through.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re gonna go off and marry someone you don&#39;t even know, then we can&#39;t be together anymore Okay.
 <br>
 Well I guess you always have Kelso to fall back on.
 <br>
 Or Fez.
 <br>
 Hey what ? Did I hear my name ? Are Jackie and I going to do it ? Can somebody tell me what is going on ?! Steven I have been so stupid for so long.
 <br>
 I tried to force Michael to marry me, I tried to force you to marry me.
 <br>
 And last night I threw myself at some unavailable creep I didn&#39;t even like.
 <br>
 Well, now you&#39;ve hit a new low.
 <br>
 Throwing yourself at some guy on Rosh Hashanah.
 <br>
 So you know what ? I&#39;m done making an ass of myself for you.
 <br>
 Or any other guys.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m done with guys completely.
 <br>
 Hear that Hyde ? We screwed her up so bad she&#39;s switching to chicks ! How awesome are we ! So I was thinking about you all week, how cute and flustered you looked when I kissed you.
 <br>
 Yess.
 <br>
