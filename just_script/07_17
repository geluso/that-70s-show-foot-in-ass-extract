<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 okay, I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re taking a video camera on a road trip.
 <br>
 You should be packing more sensible items, like toilet paper and your mother.
 <br>
 Look, mom, accept it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 Okay, my year off is now officially over, and I think I&#39;ve finally decided on a sensible career that&#39;s gonna provide me with a really stable future.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be a traveling documentary filmmaker.
 <br>
 Oh, come on.
 <br>
 You made that up.
 <br>
 Hey, kitty, I&#39;m going ice skating on a rainbow ! Eric, don&#39;t listen to him.
 <br>
 I have complete confidence you&#39;re gonna be the best traveling docu-whatsit-who-maker ever.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Do you have enough money ? Mom, I don&#39;t need that much money.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure that at stops along the way, strangers will just offer me hot pots of beans in exchange for colorful stories from the road.
 <br>
 Hot pots of beans ? What if they&#39;re spicy ? You can&#39;t even chew cinnamon gum.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 Uh, I&#39;ll miss you.
 <br>
 Well, thank you, sweetie.
 <br>
 Um, I think he was talking to me.
 <br>
 He was not.
 <br>
 Eric, who were you talking to ? Yeah, who ? It&#39;s times like this I usually fake chest pains.
 <br>
 Uh, I was talking to the prettiest girl in the driveway, that&#39;s who.
 <br>
 So, okay, I want you to promise to call me every night at 9:00.
 <br>
 Oh, he can&#39;t be calling you because he&#39;s calling me at 9:00.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I got him that watch as a gift.
 <br>
 Well, maybe he should be calling the person who gave him the gift of life.
 <br>
 So you squeezed out a baby.
 <br>
 That was a hundred years ago.
 <br>
 People have landed on the moon since then.
 <br>
 Hey, eric, I&#39;m gonna miss you, man.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, just between friends, I want you to know I&#39;m gonna take a shot or two at donna.
 <br>
 He won&#39;t care.
 <br>
 On the road, he&#39;s going to meet lots of horny girl hitchhikers looking for a ride to cheerleading camp.
 <br>
 What makes you think that, fez ? Adult films.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hello, america, and welcome to eric forman&#39;s journey to happiness, not to be mistaken with eric forman&#39;s journey to fatso burger or eric forman&#39;s journey to pee behind the piggly wiggly, which, uh, which you just saw earlier.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell ya, being on the road like this really makes you feel like a man.
 <br>
 Ahem.
 <br>
 I guess I&#39;ll just have to edit that part out later.
 <br>
 Okay, I think what we&#39;ve learned today is that the road can be a cruel, cruel mistress.
 <br>
 She caresses your tire with her asphalt hand one minute, punctures it the next.
 <br>
 But, hey, at least that didn&#39;t stop me from making it out of point place.
 <br>
 I think what we&#39;ve learned today is that the road can be a cruel, cruel mistress.
 <br>
 Oh hey, at least that didn&#39;t stop me from making it out of point place.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 17 &#34;Down The Road Apiece&#34; You know, steven, it&#39;s great we can still hang out.
 <br>
 We&#39;re kinda like sonny and cher.
 <br>
 We&#39;re together even though we&#39;ve broken up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m beautiful.
 <br>
 You&#39;re weird-looking.
 <br>
 Look, they&#39;re talking.
 <br>
 Maybe we should.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 okay, we&#39;re going upstairs.
 <br>
 Why ? Uh, uh, I just remembered that I- I can&#39;t be in the basement &#39;cause I&#39;m uncomfortable below sea level.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the best you can come up with ? Just say that we&#39;re going to take a shower.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You know, I think this is the first time we&#39;ve been alone together since, uh yeah.
 <br>
 Well, maybe we can use this opportunity to touch base about our feelings.
 <br>
 - Or we can watch tv.
 <br>
 - Great ! Oh, I love tv.
 <br>
 oh, janie, it&#39;s so hard to be in the same room with you, because even though I&#39;m a rough ne&#39;er-do-well, my love for you burns like a fire deep in my soul.
 <br>
 I feel the same, clyde, and even though we broke up because you won&#39;t marry me, I still hope that one day we&#39;ll get back together.
 <br>
 What are the chances of that ? greetings, gentle viewer.
 <br>
 Road trip update.
 <br>
 About to change a flat tire, which, uh, actually reminds me of a little joke.
 <br>
 How many psychiatrists does it take to change a flat tire ? Well, see, first, the tire has to really wanna change.
 <br>
 Good one.
 <br>
 Anyway, what do you say we, uh, slap a spare tire on this sucker, huh ? It turns out there is no spare tire.
 <br>
 and, uh, I- it&#39;s, like, pitch dark out here.
 <br>
 hello ?! Hello ?! Okay, there&#39;s definitely someone out there, and, uh, I don&#39;t know who, but I think it&#39;s a pretty safe bet to say that it&#39;s probably a convict with a hook for a hand.
 <br>
 Hello ?! Okay, buddy, you come one step closer, I got a tire iron, and I&#39;ll just give it to you if you&#39;ll go away.
 <br>
 Hey, dude.
 <br>
 What are you doing here, man ? Leo, what are you doing here ? It&#39;s like the universe wanted us to find each other, man.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 So do I know you, man ? So they&#39;re a family of monsters ? No, they&#39;re munsters.
 <br>
 And they&#39;re living in a neighborhood of normal people.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t the neighbors just get together with some guns and go over there and kill them ? I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re saving that for the last episode.
 <br>
 It&#39;s 9:15.
 <br>
 Has Eric called ? - He didn&#39;t call you ? - No.
 <br>
 I thought sure he would call you.
 <br>
 He&#39;s always choosing you over me.
 <br>
 Name one time.
 <br>
 Prom night.
 <br>
 Okay, I haven&#39;t heard from him, and I&#39;m starting to think something bad happened to him.
 <br>
 Red, we have to go look for him.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Anything&#39;s better than this crap.
 <br>
 Who wants to see monsters not get killed ? - did you ever see the new - have you seen the new go ahead.
 <br>
 - See, the other day I - I saw you said, &#34;go ahead.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah, I said it to be nice.
 <br>
 My story is much more interesting.
 <br>
 Well, go ahead, because I&#39;m not gonna listen.
 <br>
 Well, fine, then,&#39;cause I&#39;m not gonna tell you.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s as quiet as a basement with two former lovers in it.
 <br>
 I can eat the tension with a fork.
 <br>
 Wouldn&#39;t you cut the tension with a knife ? Why cut it if you&#39;re not gonna eat it ? No, no, fez, stay.
 <br>
 Stay.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you tell us one of those charming little stories about your, um, homeland ? Well, in my country, instead of bathrooms, we just he doesn&#39;t wanna stay down here with us.
 <br>
 How would you know what he wants ? You don&#39;t know what anybody wants.
 <br>
 Oh, this is so sad.
 <br>
 You&#39;re at each other&#39;s throats because of these unresolved feelings.
 <br>
 What ? No.
 <br>
 Fez, there are no unresolved feelings.
 <br>
 Really ? Then why are you so tense ? Why is your foot tapping ? Why is your foot tapping ? Because I got rhythm, baby.
 <br>
 I can never stop dancing entirely.
 <br>
 you know what, leo ? This is my first truck stop, and I love it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like, how do you find this golden oasis ? I woke up in the parking lot once.
 <br>
 And these truckers, they&#39;re like they seem like great salt of the earth guys, you know ? Hey ! Ten-four, good buddies ! Oh, oh, crap, they&#39;re looking at me.
 <br>
 No, they&#39;re looking at me, man.
 <br>
 Truckers love me.
 <br>
 They think I&#39;m Bob Seger.
 <br>
 You know what ? These guys would be the perfect people to interview for my movie.
 <br>
 - Where&#39;s your camera ? - Ah, it&#39;s so heavy.
 <br>
 So, uh, leo, what have you been doing since you left town ? Ah, just wandering around, trying to find my place in life.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ve been trying to find my place in life, too.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like, you know, like, where do I fit in ? No, I&#39;ve been looking for my house, man.
 <br>
 Boys, need anything else ? Uh, no, we&#39;re just waiting for the mechanic I met in the parking lot to come back with my spare tire and change.
 <br>
 Honey, there&#39;s no mechanic around here.
 <br>
 Uh, no, there is.
 <br>
 it&#39;s this skinny guy.
 <br>
 I gave him That&#39;d be Earl.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a speed freak.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Leo, that was my last 20 bucks.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay, man.
 <br>
 Dinner&#39;s on me.
 <br>
 Oh, thanks.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll pay ? No, I mean, I got spaghetti sauce all over me.
 <br>
 Leo, look, be serious, man.
 <br>
 What are we gonna do ? I got it.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll soak the shirt in club soda.
 <br>
 okay, I&#39;m gonna use my police academy training to figure out what happened here.
 <br>
 First thing I&#39;m gonna need is for everyone to lie face down with your hands behind your head.
 <br>
 What if he stopped to take a picture and he got kidnapped by white slavers ? They&#39;re gonna kill him.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t do anything ! I told him this was a stupid idea, and now we&#39;re stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.
 <br>
 My foot is shaking, it wants to kick his ass so bad.
 <br>
 I never should have let Eric go on this trip.
 <br>
 I should have tempted him into staying home by offering him sex.
 <br>
 I mean, scrabble.
 <br>
 Oh, look, if my baby being safe depended on you being loose, I wouldn&#39;t have to worry.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s obvious what happened to eric.
 <br>
 We got an abandoned car, a flat tire and footprints heading off in that direction.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, your son&#39;s been kidnapped by coyotes.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it more likely that he had a flat tire, couldn&#39;t change it himself and went off to find some help ? And the coyotes got him along the way.
 <br>
 Yeah, now you&#39;re thinking like a cop.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m stuckin a backwoods truck stop with no money.
 <br>
 You know, if we don&#39;t do something, this waitress is just gonna hand us over to these truckers.
 <br>
 You know, they&#39;re all freaky sexual deviants.
 <br>
 Man, woman, animal they don&#39;t care, as long as it&#39;s warm.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got an idea how we can pay for this dinner.
 <br>
 That was a good idea.
 <br>
 Now how are we gonna pay for dinner ? I think this pretty much covers your tab.
 <br>
 But if you&#39;re interested, dessert&#39;s on me.
 <br>
 in that case, you&#39;d better soak your uniform in club soda.
 <br>
 You see ? What an awesome night.
 <br>
 I am partying in the back of a truck stop with a a hippie and a waitress who are now making out.
 <br>
 Wow, the fact that I&#39;m here is not slowing them down at all.
 <br>
 Good god, woman, you buttered my toast with that hand ! Okay, enough pussy footing around which, by the way, does not mean what I thought it meant.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just get back together ? You know you want to.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even know why you broke up in the first place.
 <br>
 Because he&#39;s an incredibly immature jerk who can&#39;t commit to a future with me.
 <br>
 What she said, but I agree with me.
 <br>
 Nice rebuttal which, by the way, also does not mean what I thought it meant.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hopeless, okay ? We both wanted different things out of the relationship.
 <br>
 You just have to remember the good times, the things that brought you together.
 <br>
 Jackie, what are some of the things that hyde did that you miss ? He never did anything a boyfriend&#39;s supposed to do.
 <br>
 He never bought me a horse.
 <br>
 Okay ? He never rented a plane to spell &#34;I love you&#34; in the sky.
 <br>
 Oh, and he never even wrote me a single song.
 <br>
 How would you know ? You never stop talking long enough to listen.
 <br>
 Wait, you wrote me a song ? No.
 <br>
 Okay, okay, okay.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s try something else.
 <br>
 I want you to think back.
 <br>
 Obviously, there was something that brought you together.
 <br>
 What was that ? Well, I guess I guess I like the way his scruffy beard felt on my soft, creamy, porcelain skin.
 <br>
 Yeah, I kinda liked that, too.
 <br>
 I also kinda like the fact that she was technically still with kelso.
 <br>
 And I knew being with him would piss off my mom.
 <br>
 And all my friends.
 <br>
 Oh, and we had to keep it a secret.
 <br>
 And I felt kind of ashamed of myself.
 <br>
 So did I.
 <br>
 I kinda liked that, too.
 <br>
 So did I ! Oh, that&#39;s just so wrong.
 <br>
 Which is what made it so hot.
 <br>
 So hot.
 <br>
 Oh, fez, you should have been there.
 <br>
 Several times I was.
 <br>
 all right, listen, this type of establishment is well known to criminals, okay ? So I want you to stay close, and if there&#39;s any trouble, I&#39;m gonna use you guys as a human shield.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like the looks of these people.
 <br>
 They seem like they could tease a polite young man about his sweater and then laugh when he starts to cry.
 <br>
 Where is my baby ? See, that&#39;s the problem.
 <br>
 Maybe if you didn&#39;t baby eric so much, he wouldn&#39;t have had to leave to prove himself.
 <br>
 Well, maybe if you hadn&#39;t exhausted him with your sexual demands, he wouldn&#39;t have had to leave just to get some sleep.
 <br>
 All right, that&#39;s enough, you two.
 <br>
 If eric&#39;s in trouble, he deserves it, because he should know better by now.
 <br>
 You sound like you don&#39;t care at all.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a matter of not caring.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a matter of not giving a crap.
 <br>
 Hey, red, they got &#34;rhinestone cowboy.
 <br>
 &#34; Toss me a quarter.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 For your information, eric comes after me a lot more than I go after him.
 <br>
 You know, all you damn redheads are the same.
 <br>
 You can color it blond, but it&#39;s still there.
 <br>
 Well, it turns out I have a couple of problems with being a traveling documentary filmmaker.
 <br>
 One the traveling.
 <br>
 It&#39;s exhausting.
 <br>
 Two documentaries.
 <br>
 I only like ones that are you know, about monkeys.
 <br>
 And three filmmaking.
 <br>
 If there&#39;s no space battles, I mean, you know, really, what&#39;s the point ? I&#39;ll tell you something.
 <br>
 This day has not been a waste.
 <br>
 I realized what I really wanna do with my life is just get the hell out of point place.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ready to do that.
 <br>
 I really feel like this trip made me a man.
 <br>
 - Eric ?! - Mommy ? Thank god you&#39;re okay.
 <br>
 - Oh, dad, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 - Not you.
 <br>
 The car.
 <br>
 Eric, your mom called me a whore.
 <br>
 Only because I was worried about you and because I love you more than she does.
 <br>
 Worried ? What- what did you guys think happened ? Well, we figured you were either dead, alive or kidnapped by coyotes.
 <br>
 Looks like I was right on the money.
 <br>
 Hey, I got that waitress&#39;s phone number.
 <br>
 - Leo ? - Leo ? Hey, it&#39;s great to see you guys.
 <br>
 It&#39;s great to see you, leo.
 <br>
 So do I know you, man ? Okay, here&#39;s what I think.
 <br>
 You two were hot for each other when the relationship was secret, forbidden, taboo.
 <br>
 But when it was out in the open, the thrill was gone.
 <br>
 It was no longer taboo.
 <br>
 Then you started pushing for commitment, and you started pulling away.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 So how do we move on from here ? Move on ? There will be no moving on.
 <br>
 Your relationship is one of the sickest freakin&#39; things I&#39;ve ever seen.
 <br>
 You&#39;re two deeply disturbed individuals, and your union well, your union was a blasphemy.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re saying that if we hooked up again, it&#39;d be even wronger than before ? It can get wronger ? Well, that&#39;s kinda hot.
 <br>
 Fez, I think maybe you should leave the room now.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, you two cannot get together.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t watch.
 <br>
 I&#39;m leaving.
 <br>
 Hey, who am I kidding ? I can watch all night.
 <br>
 hey.
 <br>
 Look who I found by the side of the road.
 <br>
 Leo.
 <br>
 Man, what are you doing back in town ? I&#39;m not really sure, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, I can&#39;t tell if he has amnesia, or if he&#39;s just perfectly fine.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back, man.
 <br>
 Feeling&#39;s mutual, man.
 <br>
 Hey, wait a second.
 <br>
 You&#39;re Hyde, man.
 <br>
 Hey !
 <br>
