<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Guys, guess what I just heard in the ladies bathroom? - Fez, what were you doing in the ladies bathroom? - Oh, spying, eating lunch, y&#39;know.
 <br>
 I heard two girls say they did not want to go to college as virgins.
 <br>
 Yeah, I caught that wave last year.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m thinking if horny virgins are dying for sex, then hunting horny virgins I will go.
 <br>
 By the way Fez, it&#39;s not pronounced virgin; it&#39;s pronounced vir-GIN.
 <br>
 - I thought it was virgin? - No, no Hyde&#39;s right it&#39;s vir-GIN.
 <br>
 Oh now I will not sound stupid in front of the beautiful vir-GINS.
 <br>
 Oh my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s - that&#39;s the girl, - that&#39;s the one I made it with at the Molly Hatchet concert.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s Brooke.
 <br>
 Man, no one sleeps with that Brooke.
 <br>
 When we were sophomores and she was a senior, she turned down her science teacher, and he drove a Corvette.
 <br>
 Yeah, she was like some sort of mythical creature, like a unicorn.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird, it seems like she&#39;s moving too fast.
 <br>
 It&#39;s probably cause all my memories of her are in super jiggle sexy slo-mo.
 <br>
 Well all I know is that&#39;s her, and I did it with her, and I&#39;ll prove it.
 <br>
 Hey Brooke, now I know this is kinda awkward but could you tell my friends over there about you and me at the Molly Hatchet concert? Do I know you? Hey I&#39;m sorry to interrupt but uh Burn! No, it&#39;s me Michael from the concert.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ve been looking for you for weeks and I think you were so blissed out, and that does happen, that you gave me the wrong phone number.
 <br>
 But the good news is I wasn&#39;t a dream.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 No, Michael Kelso.
 <br>
 &#39;Let&#39;s do it in the men&#39;s room, it&#39;s more romantic.
 <br>
 &#39; No, what I kicked that kid out of the handicapped stall so we could have more room! That 70&#39;s show Season 6 Episode 4 The Acid Queen Sir Martini What is Brooke&#39;s deal, man? I mean, most girls lie about doing it with me when they haven&#39;t.
 <br>
 This the everything is backwards.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is just like Freaky Friday, but unlike that charming little movie .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 your story has no basis in fact.
 <br>
 It does too, except it&#39;s just the girl is avoiding me.
 <br>
 - I mean, how do you get a girl to come to you when you repulse her?   - Yeah, Eric? Well, I like to put a hot dog on the end of a stick, and hide in the bushes so Donna, so how do you know Brooke anyway? Did you guys jump out of a cake together or something? Yeah! No moron.
 <br>
 When she was a senior we worked on the school paper together.
 <br>
 I think you know Brooke cause there&#39;s a secret club in this town, made up of all the hot girls.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a secret hot girls club.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no secret hot girls club, believe me I&#39;d know.
 <br>
 Uh huh, well I&#39;m gonna take off.
 <br>
 I have to get to my secret hot girls meeting Why doesn&#39;t Brooke like me? I am a gentleman.
 <br>
 Oh yeah, you lied about doing it with a hot girl in the men&#39;s room.
 <br>
 You&#39;re Cary Grant.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;ve been quiet.
 <br>
 Do you think Brooke&#39;s hot? Do you really want me to answer that question? Oh I think we all do.
 <br>
 Steven, it&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 Do you think she&#39;s hot? Oh well, I guess since you&#39;re not setting a trap, I can answer honestly.
 <br>
 - Yeah, she&#39;s freakin hot.
 <br>
 - Ah ha! See, I trapped ya.
 <br>
 Now take it back or I&#39;ll pinch you.
 <br>
 Jackie, if you pinch me, it&#39;s gonna cause a serious problem in this relationship.
 <br>
 Fine Oh hey Jackie.
 <br>
 Are any of your college bound friends vir-GINS? It&#39;s pronounced virgins, Fez.
 <br>
 What? But no, but Hyde said Oh you magnificent bastard.
 <br>
 Sorry buddy.
 <br>
 By the way it&#39;s pronounced bas-TARD Fez, if you wanna find virgins, go where ugly girls pray to get pretty: The local House of Worship.
 <br>
 House of Worship? Are you sure you don&#39;t mean the House of Pies? No Fez, I mean the House of Worship.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to the House of Pies.
 <br>
 So, how&#39;s it going at Point Place Junior College? Well the education&#39;s not too great, but the upside is it&#39;s next to the Dairy Queen.
 <br>
 First day of class we all got free Peanut Buster Parfaits.
 <br>
 Hey guys.
 <br>
 - Kelso, what are you doing?! - I&#39;m looking for Brooke&#39;s phone number.
 <br>
 I mean why won&#39;t she admit that we did it? Kelso, there are racehorses, and there are donkeys.
 <br>
 And you are a great donkey, you are like top donkey.
 <br>
 But she&#39;s a racehorse, and guess what? She don&#39;t want no donkey.
 <br>
 She might.
 <br>
 Look, we had a great time together, and not just cause of the sex part, but because we had a really great time.
 <br>
 Donna, please help me find her.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ll give you a hint about where she works.
 <br>
 It&#39;s in a quiet building, you could try and check her out on a date, but she&#39;s probably booked for the future.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a travel agent? She translated her love of books into a career.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a translator.
 <br>
 &#34;Trabaja en la biblioteca&#34;, Kelso.
 <br>
 She&#39;s the translator, not me Donna.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know, enough with these brain teasers.
 <br>
 You tell me where Brooke works, and I&#39;ll return your underpants to safety.
 <br>
 Kelso, aren&#39;t you a little old to be stealing Donna&#39;s undies? A collector never stops collecting, Eric.
 <br>
 The library, Kelso, she works in the library.
 <br>
 Now will you put my underwear back you perv? I lied.
 <br>
 Ooo wow, those male actors are gorgeous.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know I think that Robert Redford is so hot.
 <br>
 He&#39;s hotter than the sun.
 <br>
 He&#39;s extremely handsome.
 <br>
 You know who I think is sexy? James Caan in the Godfather.
 <br>
 Now, if he made me an offer, I sure couldn&#39;t refuse.
 <br>
 Yowsa! Do you mind? I&#39;m sorry; I thought we were having a conversation.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know what Steven, I actually think that every guy on TV, and in life is hotter than you.
 <br>
 Jackie, I know what you&#39;re doing, okay? I said Brooke was hot, and now you&#39;re totally insecure.
 <br>
 Oh I am not insecure, okay? This is a designer sweater, this is designer eye shadow, and those are designer shoes, and they make me feel incredibly secure.
 <br>
 You know who else I like? That little fella who plays Colombo.
 <br>
 I just wanna give him a bath.
 <br>
 Steven, why can&#39;t you just say that Brooke&#39;s not hot? It&#39;s common relationship courtesy.
 <br>
 If you can&#39;t do this what will you do when I&#39;m old, and ask you if I have crow&#39;s feet around my eyes? By the way, that&#39;s already starting.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve never been in a relationship, have you son? What, when she asked if Brooke was hot, I should have lied and said no? Being honest and screwing yourself is clearly the better plan.
 <br>
 Sweetie, white lies help relationships.
 <br>
 Like, &#39;Kitty, even though your pot roast was overdone, I still loved it.
 <br>
 &#39; Oh for the love of God, I did love it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a pot roast genius, okay? It was like eating gold.
 <br>
 - So you&#39;re saying lying is good? - Exactly.
 <br>
 Now go do the right thing, and lie to the woman you love! - Red, this is crazy right? - Yeah, they&#39;re all nuts.
 <br>
 Except you, sweetheart.
 <br>
 Look at all the smart, lonely girls.
 <br>
 Little ones, big ones; it&#39;s like a virgin pumpkin patch.
 <br>
 - Can I help you? - Yes, I&#39;d like an order of books please.
 <br>
 - Could you be more specific? - Could you be more beautiful? Could you be more lame? Yes - Excuse me, I&#39;m trying to read.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t be a sissy.
 <br>
 - Y&#39;know what? Here&#39;s a firecracker, go live a little.
 <br>
 - Thanks Look, I know why you&#39;re here and I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re not my type.
 <br>
 I was high school valedictorian and you&#39;re the antithesis of that.
 <br>
 The anti-who-of-what? Exactly.
 <br>
 Okay no, come on don&#39;t be like that okay? Look I really like you and I just thought that maybe we could go out some time, like for coffee.
 <br>
 and then if that went good, then we could go to a movie.
 <br>
 and then when we really start to trust each other, you can tell my friends how we did it at the Molly Hatchet concert.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t make it with guys at concerts.
 <br>
 I read two periodicals a week about the Dewey Decimal system, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve never heard of.
 <br>
 Okay I have heard of Dewey Decimal it&#39;s Donald Ducks nephew.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Brooke.
 <br>
 I mean standing there at the library, totally resisting me.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe we have a library.
 <br>
 I know, what is it like invisible? No, no, you know that parking lot where we drink beer in? Okay, well you know that wall that we lean up against? That&#39;s the library.
 <br>
 Well then, guess who has peed on the library? Y&#39;know for the first time in my life, I hope there&#39;s not a secret hot girls club, because if there is, I bet Brooke said awful things about me at their last meeting.
 <br>
 Order bitches.
 <br>
 The secret hot girls club is now in session.
 <br>
 Now, last meeting we all decided to go braless, and I just wanna report that operation bazooma bounce is driving the boys insane.
 <br>
 Hi, my name is Brooke and I&#39;ve been a hot girl for 6 years.
 <br>
 Hi Brooke.
 <br>
 And I just wanna let everyone know that Michael Kelso asked me out, and I resisted his charms and turned him down.
 <br>
 - But he&#39;s irresistible.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s what I thought, but it&#39;s a lie, a lie I tell you.
 <br>
 Then it&#39;s official.
 <br>
 No secret hot girl will ever date Michael Kelso ever again.
 <br>
 Okay that&#39;s great, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Now this calls for dancing bubble kiss time! Kelso, there is no secret hot girls club.
 <br>
 Well of course the president won&#39;t admit it.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know I don&#39;t care is there&#39;s a club or not, dancing bubble kiss time is just a fabulous idea.
 <br>
 Well all I know is that Brooke and I had a romantic night together at the concert.
 <br>
 Why is she pretending like it didn&#39;t happen? Well maybe she&#39;s embarrassed.
 <br>
 I mean she&#39;s used to dating really brainy guys.
 <br>
 Yeah, not guys who set their own pants on fire.
 <br>
 On a dare.
 <br>
 And I won a dollar.
 <br>
 Kelso, if you want Brooke to like you, y&#39;know maybe you should go down to the library and show her you can be smart.
 <br>
 I hate the library.
 <br>
 The only good thing about it is that you can check out Playboys.
 <br>
 I mean they have every issue since it started.
 <br>
 Wait, every issue? Are you telling me that they have the one with Pamela Sue Martin, televisions Nancy Drew, in a grotto, straddling the world&#39;s luckiest boulder? Uh, they have periodicals you say? What is wrong with Steven? I mean why won&#39;t he just say that Brooke&#39;s not hot? Because he doesn&#39;t know how to lie.
 <br>
 He&#39;s an orphan; he never had a mother to teach him how.
 <br>
 I mean, how do I know he loves me if he doesn&#39;t obey me? Well, you&#39;ve chosen a strong man, Jackie and they don&#39;t always obey.
 <br>
 Now, do I think he should have said that other girl wasn&#39;t pretty, yes, but you have to pick your battles.
 <br>
 Wait, no, I wanna be right all the time.
 <br>
 And you will be.
 <br>
 After a few years they just they give up.
 <br>
 Okay, watch.
 <br>
 Red, could you go to the drug store and get me a Ladies Home Journal? But I just It&#39;s all frosty.
 <br>
 Aw Crap! Jackpot my friend.
 <br>
 Not only did I get Nancy Drew, but I also got Margot Kidder, Superman&#39;s Lois Lane, in an outfit that, let&#39;s just say you don&#39;t need x-ray vision to appreciate.
 <br>
 Well get those outta here, man I&#39;m trying to impress Brooke with my intelligence.
 <br>
 Here she comes.
 <br>
 Say Eric, this encyclopaedia of scientific terms has really taught me something.
 <br>
 See by lifting this encyclopaedia of scientific terms above my head, I&#39;m using my body&#39;s stored energy, also known as uranium.
 <br>
 Um, actually it&#39;s known as calories, but I do believe at some point you were exposed to radiation.
 <br>
 Alright look, I don&#39;t know what you have against me, but I&#39;m not leaving here until I convince you to go out with me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the man who gave me the firecrackers, Mom.
 <br>
 I gotta run.
 <br>
 You wanna check something out? No, um is there someone else who can help me? Like a man.
 <br>
 So you wanna check out those Playboys, or not? Okay, fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a man, I would like these Playboys.
 <br>
 Well, you can&#39;t have them.
 <br>
 I want you to get in your car, buy some flowers, give them to Donna, and thank God an actual live woman lets you touch her.
 <br>
 Yes ma&#39;am.
 <br>
 Okay Steven, I think I figured out a way to end this situation where everybody wins.
 <br>
 Now, listen to this question carefully.
 <br>
 Is there anyone you said was hot - like Brooke, who you really don&#39;t think is hot - like Brooke? Well I could lie and say yes.
 <br>
 Then do it.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care of you don&#39;t mean it; it&#39;s the words that count.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m not gonna lie.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Then y&#39;know what, I don&#39;t know how to fix this.
 <br>
 &#39;pick you battles.
 <br>
 &#39; Fine.
 <br>
 Steven, I don&#39;t care if you think she&#39;s hot, because that&#39;s how you really feel.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Hey Steven, will you go to the drug store and get me a Vogue magazine? But I just It&#39;s gonna melt.
 <br>
 Crap! Well, my plan to have sex with virgins failed, so I&#39;ve widened my search from virgins to everyone.
 <br>
 So, basically you&#39;re back to where you started this morning.
 <br>
 Not really, I had some pie.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done less in a day.
 <br>
 Well Donna, turns out Brooke doesn&#39;t like intelligent men.
 <br>
 Kelso, you didn&#39;t have sex with her man, just let it go.
 <br>
 Michael, I need to talk to you.
 <br>
 Yeah, about what? About our night together at the Molly Hatchet concert.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Burn! Burn! Burn, Burn! BurnBurn! Burn We totally did it! Michael, I just found out I&#39;m pregnant.
 <br>
 I never touched her.
 <br>
 Psst kid, hey you see this? That&#39;s a Playboy.
 <br>
 And inside are things beyond your wildest dreams, magical glorious things.
 <br>
 So if you toss it in your book, and you check it out for me, I&#39;ll let you have a look see, what do ya say? You&#39;re pathetic, just go buy a Playboy, you loser.
 <br>
 Loser? Hey I&#39;m not the one reading Hardy Boys.
 <br>
 For your information the stolen money was hidden in the grandfather clock! Who&#39;s the loser now?
 <br>
