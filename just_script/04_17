<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Guys, look what I got for Big Rhonda.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s so nice to have a girlfriend on Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 Yeah, it definitely increases the chance of gettin&#39; your fun stuff touched.
 <br>
 Well, sorry, fun stuff.
 <br>
 Looks like it&#39;s just you and me this year.
 <br>
 Unless- - Sorry, fun stuff.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, Rhonda&#39;s going to love these.
 <br>
 I just have to not eat them until Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 - But you love candy.
 <br>
 - Some would say it&#39;s an unnatural love.
 <br>
 Yes, I do love candy.
 <br>
 But I love Rhonda more.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause there&#39;s three pieces missing.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I love her the same.
 <br>
 Hi, sweetie.
 <br>
 How was work? I am so exhausted.
 <br>
 Yeah, the commute from Austria must be a real bitch.
 <br>
 A bus full of old people stopped by the Cheese Palace.
 <br>
 And when they saw free samples, all hell broke loose.
 <br>
 But the good news is I got paid! Oh, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause Valentine&#39;s Day&#39;s coming up, and I need you to give me money and tell me whatever foo-foo crap gift you want to get.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;m not doing that again.
 <br>
 Last year I gave you money, and you bought a bag of plastic dinosaurs.
 <br>
 For you! Look, you need to make some cash and buy me something nice because I worked way too hard for my money, and you&#39;re not gettin&#39; any.
 <br>
 Oh, I smell like hickory.
 <br>
 Oh, this bites.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez, how&#39;s it going with not eating the candy? Fine, thank you.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Casey Kelso&#39;s here.
 <br>
 What? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 He is so fine.
 <br>
 You know, if you marry Casey and I marry Michael we&#39;ll be like sisters.
 <br>
 Yea! Okay, go talk to him.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - I want to go baby shopping with you.
 <br>
 Now go! All right.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Casey.
 <br>
 Hey, Pinciotti.
 <br>
 How you been? Love the jeans.
 <br>
 Really? They&#39;re blue.
 <br>
 Um so what have you, like, you know, been up to? I&#39;m working part-time for the railroad.
 <br>
 They leave a lot of stuff unlocked.
 <br>
 You need any Cheerios or rebar? - No, I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 - Right on.
 <br>
 Well, listen, I&#39;ll give you a call sometime, but right now I gotta go see a guy.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got a leather steering-wheel cover.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 For the Trans Am.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I was thinkin&#39; about using my G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Bill for college but, uh, Trans Ams just kick so much ass.
 <br>
 I love the Trans Am! Everybody does.
 <br>
 - See ya.
 <br>
 - Okay, bye.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s gonna call me.
 <br>
 - You gave him your number? Of course I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Damn it! Oh, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Kelsos never call.
 <br>
 They&#39;re like dogs.
 <br>
 They&#39;re cute, but they can&#39;t work a phone.
 <br>
 Hey,Jackie.
 <br>
 I thought about what you said about making money so I can get you a Valentine&#39;s Day gift, right? And then I realized that it&#39;d mean a lot more if I gave you something that I crafted with my own two loving hands.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! It&#39;s horrible! No, it&#39;s an address rock.
 <br>
 You put it on your lawn.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Happy Valentine&#39;s Day, my love.
 <br>
 Michael, a rock is not a romantic gift.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s not even my address.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my address.
 <br>
 No, it isn&#39;t.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my dad&#39;s address rock! No, it isn&#39;t! Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 You want this? Thanks, Son.
 <br>
 I love you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 What? I love you.
 <br>
 I really do.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Yeah.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) - Donna! What are you doing at my house? Nothing.
 <br>
 I just thought I&#39;d come by and see what you were up to.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re here to see Casey, aren&#39;t you? Casey, your lover&#39;s here! ( Singsong Voice ) You love my brother! You&#39;re gonna do it with- Ow! Mom! - Thank you.
 <br>
 - No problem.
 <br>
 ( Kelso ) Spaz face.
 <br>
 ! - Hey, there.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Um, you were gonna call me, and I remember I never, like, gave you my number.
 <br>
 So, anyway, here&#39;s my number.
 <br>
 You know, I was gonna get that from you tomorrow night when we go out.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re going out? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll pick you up at The Hub after school.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in the Trans Am.
 <br>
 I love the Trans Am! Everybody does.
 <br>
 Later, Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Mom, was Dad abducted by aliens and replaced by an identical creature programmed to love? Honey, this is breakfast.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t ask me things.
 <br>
 He told me he loved me.
 <br>
 Your father? No! Yeah.
 <br>
 I think I know what happened.
 <br>
 I gave your father an early Valentine&#39;s Day card that said what a wonderful husband and father he is and it rhymed, and maybe it touched him.
 <br>
 It didn&#39;t look like it touched him.
 <br>
 He just- He got up and got a beer.
 <br>
 But maybe deep down- deep, deep, deep down- something woke up.
 <br>
 I am so glad he loves you.
 <br>
 Yeah, but, Mom, this is weird.
 <br>
 He&#39;s never said that.
 <br>
 Ever.
 <br>
 One time I saved him from getting hit by a lumber truck and I think he was about to say it, but then he said &#39;&#39;Get in the car.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; But how am I supposed to handle this? You think I should say it back? ( Grunts ) He&#39;s gonna hit me.
 <br>
 Maybe not.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe thatJackie wants me to get a job.
 <br>
 I mean, my plan has always been to coast through life on my good looks.
 <br>
 I mean, look at me! It&#39;s like I was chiseled out of marble.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, here goes.
 <br>
 Dad, I love you.
 <br>
 I love you, Pop.
 <br>
 Poppy? Pappy? Daddy? No.
 <br>
 Oh, I have to- I have to stop eating Rhonda&#39;s chocolates.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s hopeless.
 <br>
 Kelso, if you need to make some quick cash,just sell your blood.
 <br>
 And you! You&#39;ve had enough of this! No, I can stop anytime I want.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) ( Crashing ) I am not selling blood.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no way that anything inside of my body is comin&#39; out for cash.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s too bad, Kelso, &#39;cause I hear there&#39;s this clinic in Madison that&#39;ll pay you for your, um, manly donations.
 <br>
 Manly donations? No way! They&#39;ll pay you for that? Well, I&#39;ll do that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good at that.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Do you have any serious medical conditions?&#39;&#39; Puked after Crunch Berry eating contest.
 <br>
 - You know what? I&#39;ll just finish that for you.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Now, Mr.
 <br>
 Chang you&#39;ll be in room two.
 <br>
 Some of our clients prefer a magazine.
 <br>
 Would you like one? Nah.
 <br>
 Farrah was on Carson last night.
 <br>
 I should be good to go.
 <br>
 Okay, so I was in the kitchen and Red came in, and I was gonna tell him I loved him.
 <br>
 But, uh, then he said if my hair got any longer he was gonna buy me a pair of boobs, so- Yeah, you&#39;re in a tough spot.
 <br>
 But just know I&#39;m here for you, &#39;cause I love you.
 <br>
 You know what would make Forman feel better? A piece of that candy.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 There&#39;s only nine left.
 <br>
 I will guard them with my life.
 <br>
 Hyde! Eric! Fez! Easiest money I ever made.
 <br>
 They paid me 50 bucks for my underpants navy.
 <br>
 You mean your corduroy commandos? Yeah, your team from the inseam? Your Battle-pants Galactica? - Battle-pants Galactica.
 <br>
 Nice one.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 - It just came to me.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Man, this job is the greatest.
 <br>
 It combines all my interests, hobbies and skills into one moneymaking endeavor.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna getJackie a sweet gift.
 <br>
 Popcorn? - Dude! - Oh, forget it! All right, Kelso.
 <br>
 Where the hell is your moron brother? He was supposed to meet me at The Hub, and he totally blew me off.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 A Kelso blew you off? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 What a shock.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Colonel Mustard called.
 <br>
 He said get a clue.
 <br>
 What is wrong with you Kelsos? Did all of you get dropped on your heads? You know, if you&#39;re mad at Casey, why don&#39;t you go yell at him? I&#39;m too tired from working all day to argue.
 <br>
 Oh, to be a working stiff.
 <br>
 So, Red, you big, old softy.
 <br>
 ( Snickering ) Did anything special happen yesterday? Special? Well, let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 The dentist called with a cancellation, so I went in and the sadistic son of a bitch found a cavity.
 <br>
 The next thing I know, I&#39;m hopped up on drugs and he&#39;s taking a jackhammer to my jaw.
 <br>
 I spent the rest of the day in a fog.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t remember what you said to Eric? Kitty, I don&#39;t even remember how I got home.
 <br>
 All right, Dad.
 <br>
 Look, I tried to figure out the right words and then I realized I just gotta say it, so- - Wait, Eric- - Mom, please.
 <br>
 Dad, I- ( Slowed Down ) Stop! He was drugged! love you.
 <br>
 Go to your room.
 <br>
 Rhonda is going to be so disappointed.
 <br>
 All that remains is one lonely candy.
 <br>
 Look! More candies! It&#39;s a Valentine&#39;s Day miracle! Oh, candy you&#39;ve got me under your spell! Jackie, I couldn&#39;t wait till Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 So here.
 <br>
 ( Giggles ) ( Gasps ) Oh, my God, Michael! These earrings are gorgeous! Big day at the office? Yeah, I worked a double shift.
 <br>
 Wai-Wait.
 <br>
 You got a job? Michael, I am so proud of you.
 <br>
 Well, now, if it wasn&#39;t for you pushing me I would&#39;ve never realized how good it feels to roll up my sleeves, get a little sweaty and earn some cash.
 <br>
 Oh, this is so exciting! I can&#39;t wait to come visit you at work.
 <br>
 That&#39;ll speed things up.
 <br>
 What&#39;s he talking about? Oh.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been selling my love nectar.
 <br>
 What? Michael, you can&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 You&#39;re hot.
 <br>
 Women are gonna want to take your little Kelsos home.
 <br>
 My God, she&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Think about it- a world full of Kelsos.
 <br>
 Libraries will fall into disrepair.
 <br>
 There&#39;ll be feathered hair as far as the eye can see.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll have to put padding on every sharp corner! Hey, those sharp corners can be hazardous, man.
 <br>
 I mean, come on.
 <br>
 It&#39;s 1 97 8! Things should be round by now! -  ( Radio: Instrumental ) - Hey! Hey, Casey! Hey, Pinciotti.
 <br>
 What the hell happened to you? I was waiting at The Hub? Oh, man.
 <br>
 See, the thing is, when I went to go pick up the steering-wheel cover the Trans Am was running kind of rough, so I thought I&#39;d rebuild the carburetor.
 <br>
 But I was waiting at The Hub.
 <br>
 Well, you want a smooth ride, don&#39;t you? I just think that if you say you&#39;re gonna be someplace that you should be there.
 <br>
 Aw, man, I guess I flaked.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve just got this thing where a lot of times I don&#39;t show up.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do about it.
 <br>
 How about showing up? I guess I could give that a shot.
 <br>
 So this will never happen again? No, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;ll happen again.
 <br>
 But we&#39;ll light that firecracker when we come to it.
 <br>
 Fair enough.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 When I got here, I was so mad at you and I already totally forgave you.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Everybody does.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) I&#39;m sorry, miss, but I can&#39;t give it to you.
 <br>
 The donor himself is the only one who has legal rights over the specimen.
 <br>
 Fine! Michael, you get them! You&#39;re the only one who has rights over your &#39;&#39;special men.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Jackie, what do you care what I do with my special men? Specimen.
 <br>
 I said, specimen.
 <br>
 I care because if there are gonna be any little Kelso babies well, I want them to be ours.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 You want to have my children? Well, yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, if you get rich and don&#39;t lose your hair.
 <br>
 Because I love you.
 <br>
 I love you too.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t do that here.
 <br>
 Oh, she&#39;s right.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be in room two.
 <br>
 - Dad? - Oh, crap.
 <br>
 I was hoping that you wouldn&#39;t find me back here.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a good icebreaker.
 <br>
 Look, um about the &#39;&#39;love&#39;&#39; incident- All right.
 <br>
 Stop right there.
 <br>
 There are only a few times in life when it&#39;s acceptable for a man to use that phrase- when he&#39;s drunk, when he&#39;s dying or when he&#39;s in big trouble and that&#39;s the only way out.
 <br>
 Which usually means he&#39;s drunk.
 <br>
 So, other than that- Other than that, it&#39;s just a given.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hey, you just kind of told me- No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yes, you did.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m drunk.
 <br>
 Clearly I&#39;m drunk.
 <br>
 Daddy, be my valentine.
 <br>
 ( Mock Sobbing ) Do I have to hit you? Go to your room.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Good news.
 <br>
 My boys are back in friendly hands.
 <br>
 Ironically, that&#39;s just where they started their journey.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a shame, Kelso.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the one job I knew you could&#39;ve been a success at.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 Kelso, get that nasty bag of genetics out of my basement.
 <br>
 - This bag? - ( All Gasping ) Burn! It&#39;s just a big bag of candy.
 <br>
 Candy? What kind of candy?
 <br>
