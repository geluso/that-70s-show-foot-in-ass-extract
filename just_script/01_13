<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 All right, this is no sweat.
 <br>
 If we leave right after school we should make it to Jackie&#39;s ski cabin by, like, 6:00.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t wait.
 <br>
 A trip to my favorite place.
 <br>
 Anywhere but here.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m betting that Alpine Valley is gonna give the kid many make-out opportunities with Donna this weekend.
 <br>
 - The kid is in.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s with the whole &#34;kid&#34; thing? It&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not cool? Not cool.
 <br>
 Dorky.
 <br>
 Guess who made out with Pam Macy behind the gym? Everyone.
 <br>
 No! Me! Kelso, a lot of people hang out behind the gym.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s what&#39;s so great about it.
 <br>
 Everybody saw it! That&#39;s great, man.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Because now everybody can tell Jackie, you moron.
 <br>
 Then she&#39;s gonna dump you and we won&#39;t be able to go up - to her ski cabin.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s never gonna find out.
 <br>
 You are a dog, Michael, a dirty, dirty dog! - What did I do? - You kissed Pam Macy.
 <br>
 I trusted you, Michael, and now all my friends are laughing at me.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even show my face in the third floor bathroom anymore.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s the cool bathroom.
 <br>
 - But, I - No, Michael.
 <br>
 We&#39;re through.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 If that&#39;s the way you want it, we&#39;re through.
 <br>
 And Monday, when we get back from that ski trip, it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 No, Michael, no.
 <br>
 You won&#39;t be skiing this weekend.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just great, Jackie.
 <br>
 Cancel the ski trip and disappoint all our friends.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 We are still going.
 <br>
 They&#39;re surely not going without me.
 <br>
 Right, guys? And did I mention my parents are not coming so it&#39;ll be just us? So, we&#39;ll see you Monday! Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! So, Eric&#39;s going away for the weekend.
 <br>
 Whole house to ourselves.
 <br>
 You know what that means? Dinner in front of the TV.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You dog.
 <br>
 Now, Eric, you&#39;re gonna be driving in snow so I&#39;ll put together an emergency roadside kit for you.
 <br>
 - In case you run into trouble.
 <br>
 - Okay, that&#39;d be great.
 <br>
 Preparation makes all the difference, Eric.
 <br>
 Take kitty litter.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t tell you how many times kitty litter got me out of a tight spot.
 <br>
 I remember one time in the &#39;70s.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, Eric.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a road flare.
 <br>
 A road flare can save your life.
 <br>
 I said, &#34;A road flare can save your life.
 <br>
 &#34; What? Check.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Road flare.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Okay, now, good.
 <br>
 How was school today? Okay, you know my PE Teacher, Coach Wilson? He had this crusty stuff in the corner of his lip.
 <br>
 So Kelso says to him &#34;Coach, check out that crusty stuff&#34; Last week, the coach Dad? Dad, are you even listening? Of course I&#39;m listening.
 <br>
 And you know what I&#39;m hearing? You need to buckle down.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve told you over and over again that school is so important.
 <br>
 What you do now determines Red, that is so good.
 <br>
 Right there.
 <br>
 That hasn&#39;t been touched in years.
 <br>
 Donna, man, I brought my double sleeping bag.
 <br>
 You know? Great.
 <br>
 Can Eric and I borrow it? Hyde, watching you fail over and over it is like Charlie Brown and the football.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, I just don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 No, because Eric already has it.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 Look, I just wanna make sure we&#39;re cool.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause this weekend is, like, really important for me and Donna.
 <br>
 So, thanks for understanding.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I understand.
 <br>
 I understand that we&#39;re not friends anymore.
 <br>
 Look, man, you brought this on yourself.
 <br>
 I know I did, but that&#39;s no reason for me to suffer.
 <br>
 No, that is a great reason for you to suffer.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 See if I care.
 <br>
 Come on, Eric.
 <br>
 Come on, man.
 <br>
 - Here&#39;s your emergency roadside kit.
 <br>
 - Kitty litter? Kitty litter.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Honey, I put some sandwiches in your duffel bag.
 <br>
 Now why do you need such a big bag of oregano? Donna&#39;s Italian.
 <br>
 Okay, stay warm.
 <br>
 Okay, I see what&#39;s going on.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not really going skiing.
 <br>
 This is all just a gag.
 <br>
 You&#39;re trying to get me all worked up so you can go, &#34;Just kidding, buddy!&#34; Yeah, you got me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a nice burn.
 <br>
 It sure is.
 <br>
 Bye-bye.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not going.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll be back.
 <br>
 Any second now.
 <br>
 He&#39;s probably just going around the block.
 <br>
 I gotta hand it to him, he got me there.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a major burn.
 <br>
 Yup.
 <br>
 There he is.
 <br>
 I knew it! No, that&#39;s not him.
 <br>
 I have never seen snow before.
 <br>
 It is so beautiful.
 <br>
 Do you know what the best part of this whole trip is? That Michael is not here.
 <br>
 He&#39;d just be sitting here telling me how cute I look in my fur-trimmed coat.
 <br>
 I know I look cute.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need him here for that.
 <br>
 Forman, man, what&#39;s all this crap that Red gave you? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 He&#39;s obsessed with kitty litter.
 <br>
 I think he might be going insane.
 <br>
 Far out.
 <br>
 What the hell was that? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I guess we hit some ice.
 <br>
 Great, we&#39;re stuck.
 <br>
 Look, I made my first snowball.
 <br>
 I love snow so much, my fingers are numb with joy.
 <br>
 That&#39;s frostbite, Fez.
 <br>
 How rude.
 <br>
 I hate your white man&#39;s winter.
 <br>
 Get in the car, Fez.
 <br>
 Eric, do something.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, stop goofing around.
 <br>
 It&#39;s freezing.
 <br>
 This is awful.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all going to die and I love Michael.
 <br>
 Shut up! Okay, think, Eric, think.
 <br>
 Why kitty litter? Use the gum, Eric.
 <br>
 Dad? What&#39;re you doing here? I&#39;m not here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re imagining me.
 <br>
 Now who&#39;s insane, Mr.
 <br>
 Smartmouth? I guess I am.
 <br>
 Use the gum to stick the candle in the can.
 <br>
 The candle heats the can, which melts the snow behind the tire.
 <br>
 Then pour on the kitty litter for traction.
 <br>
 Now you think you can handle that? - Yes, sir.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Because you don&#39;t want me back out here.
 <br>
 I may be a figment of your imagination I&#39;m still freezing my ass off.
 <br>
 Michael, what are you doing down here? You know what? I think Eric actually went.
 <br>
 What a jerk.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just go to Jackie&#39;s cabin and talk to him? I can&#39;t, I don&#39;t have a car.
 <br>
 Besides, Jackie hates me forever &#39;cause I kissed Pam Macy.
 <br>
 You know, when Mr.
 <br>
 Forman and I were dating I saw him kissing a girl in a movie theater once and I forgave him.
 <br>
 You forgave him for kissing another girl? Yes, sir.
 <br>
 I mean it wasn&#39;t so much kissing as it was a groping sloppy, pawing, nibbling nightmare.
 <br>
 But you forgave him.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I forgave the bastard.
 <br>
 Cool! Okay.
 <br>
 Candles, check.
 <br>
 Chianti, check.
 <br>
 Fancy nut mix, check.
 <br>
 And how&#39;s my pretty lady? You are so full of crap.
 <br>
 Hello there.
 <br>
 Thanks for stopping.
 <br>
 Are you going all the way to Alpine Valley? I&#39;m going wherever you&#39;re going.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 That&#39;s lucky.
 <br>
 So tell me, did it hurt? What? When you fell down from heaven.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 All right, we made it! Yeah, just in time.
 <br>
 That storm was getting nasty.
 <br>
 I am so cold.
 <br>
 The snow has stolen my manhood.
 <br>
 There&#39;s only one bedroom.
 <br>
 It was gonna be for Michael and I, but since our love is Dead you two should take it.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Want to go check out our room? Definitely.
 <br>
 Where are you guys going? I thought we were gonna hang the I am freezing.
 <br>
 The winter in my country is 70 degrees.
 <br>
 We must hold each other for warmth.
 <br>
 Stop touching me! But I am going to die! Okay, Fez, amaretto.
 <br>
 You know what, man? This&#39;ll warm you right up.
 <br>
 Take a sip of that.
 <br>
 Yum, liquid candy.
 <br>
 Kitty, you&#39;re talking about something that happened over 20 years ago.
 <br>
 And there you were at the movies, in front of God and everybody slurping on horse face Lyn Taylor like she was a Popsicle.
 <br>
 Kitty A big, easy, horse-faced Popsicle.
 <br>
 Horse face? She was a runner-up in the Miss Wisconsin pageant.
 <br>
 Which she lost because she was such a horse face.
 <br>
 Thanks for the burger.
 <br>
 And the hat.
 <br>
 I just like to see that smile.
 <br>
 You seem kinda down about your friend Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, you know, he&#39;s always been there for me.
 <br>
 Like when people used to call me dumb he&#39;d say, &#34;He&#39;s not as dumb as you think.
 <br>
 &#34; People don&#39;t like to talk about it but guy-to-guy relationships are pretty special, you know? They can be the most beautiful thing in the world.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why I do this stuff.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, like I get these urges, you know, and I can&#39;t control them.
 <br>
 Shoot, I wrote that country song.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been cheated Been mistreated When will I be loved That&#39;s probably just Jackie crying.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 All right, that&#39;s too much.
 <br>
 Can you please go out there and break that record? What&#39;s going on? &#34;Spy vs.
 <br>
 Spy,&#34; man, they kill me.
 <br>
 No, with her.
 <br>
 She seems upset or something.
 <br>
 Okay, look, where&#39;s Fez? Fez? He killed that entire bottle of amaretto and then he ran outside, saying he had to make a snow angel.
 <br>
 But he was in his underwear.
 <br>
 Look, you either need to go get Fez or console Jackie.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;ll take Donna.
 <br>
 - Jackie.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay, I can see you&#39;re upset.
 <br>
 Now, listen, all right? If it&#39;s any consolation Pam Macy would give it up to anybody.
 <br>
 What do you know? We&#39;re all alone.
 <br>
 God, Hyde, you can be such a jerk, you know that? - Come on, I&#39;m just goofing around.
 <br>
 - No, you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m up here with Eric.
 <br>
 All right? - Get it? Not you.
 <br>
 - I know, okay? Look, do you think I like hitting on my best friend&#39;s girlfriend? I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 But I look at you, I mean, look at you.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t help it.
 <br>
 You better.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so clear to me now.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t just go around using people as my sexual playthings.
 <br>
 You know what I mean, Gus? &#39;Cause people&#39;s feelings are way more important than those sexual urges.
 <br>
 You&#39;re good people, son.
 <br>
 You, too, man.
 <br>
 This is where you get off.
 <br>
 And one more thing.
 <br>
 Next time, take a bus.
 <br>
 You&#39;re too pretty to hitch.
 <br>
 Thanks, man.
 <br>
 Bye, Gus.
 <br>
 Fez! Hey, man.
 <br>
 - Kelso.
 <br>
 You&#39;re here.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I got a ride with the nicest guy.
 <br>
 Listen, I had a lot of time to think on the way up here.
 <br>
 And, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I should never have come up here without you, man.
 <br>
 I am a winter nymph.
 <br>
 I love the snow.
 <br>
 Hooray America! Michael! You walked all the way here in a driving snowstorm just to be with me didn&#39;t you, Michael? And you would never ever do that for Pam Macy, would you? No? Lover.
 <br>
 You know it.
 <br>
 Could one of you guys put his pants on? Kitty, this can&#39;t just be about me and Lyn Taylor.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s really bothering you? - Okay.
 <br>
 I just want to know why not me? Why not you what? I married you.
 <br>
 Yeah, but when we were dating, you just sat there.
 <br>
 You held my hand politely.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you think that I might enjoy a passionate manhandling in a public place? I respected you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m an old-fashioned guy.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think that you should grope and maul the one you love.
 <br>
 Until you get to Florida at the Fontainebleau with the door locked and a carton of cigarettes.
 <br>
 Red, our honeymoon.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go upstairs.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go to the movies.
 <br>
 Here we are.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 So, I still can&#39;t believe that Kelso cheated on Jackie with Pam Macy.
 <br>
 I mean, that is just a seriously uncool move.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, to risk everything for Eric, I would never do that to you.
 <br>
 You can trust me.
 <br>
 Really? Absolutely.
 <br>
 I would never kiss Pam Macy behind the gym.
 <br>
 Never say never, Donna.
 <br>
 This night turned out okay.
 <br>
 Pretty romantic.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s just how I imagined it.
 <br>
 Just you and me I do not feel too good.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Okay, maybe it&#39;s not just how I imagined.
 <br>
 Cover your ears, this part gets pretty gross.
 <br>
