<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, Donna, when we register for our wedding, could we register for a trampoline? My mom won&#39;t let me have a trampoline.
 <br>
 If I&#39;d known about registering when I married Laurie, I would have registered for a wife who wants to have sex with me.
 <br>
 Eric, you know, people only register for stuff that&#39;s used in serving, eating and clearing of a meal.
 <br>
 Why is it always about eating? Because marriage signifies the end of trying to be attractive.
 <br>
 Man, registering sucks.
 <br>
 I had to register with Jackie for her sweet 16.
 <br>
 Longest five months of my life.
 <br>
 Look, all I know is you guys are gonna buy whatever wedding present we tell you, and none of this all-going-in- on-one-gift crap.
 <br>
 Hey, hey, shut it, huh? No talk about weddings.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s on her way over.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not here now.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t have to hear the word &#34;wedding.
 <br>
 &#34; She can sense that it was said.
 <br>
 I wish I could do that.
 <br>
 But not so much with words, but so that I could see through people&#39;s clothes.
 <br>
 Look, you two start yapping about your wedding, Jackie gets all, &#34;Steven, when are we getting married?&#34; Then I have to say, &#34;we&#39;re not getting married,&#34; and she kicks me in my shins.
 <br>
 From the knees down, I&#39;m like a frickin&#39; P.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 No, you have magnificent legs.
 <br>
 I would say W.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 May I help oh, it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 Hello, Fenton.
 <br>
 You two know each other? Yeah, this is the weirdo who sold me your ring.
 <br>
 He&#39;s probably worn it more than you, so maybe she doesn&#39;t want to wear it because it&#39;s from you.
 <br>
 Well, maybe you need to keep your nose outta my business! Trust me, your business is the last place I want to put my nose! I&#39;m sorry, man.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 We&#39;re here to register for our wedding.
 <br>
 Oh, wonderful.
 <br>
 And I see we&#39;re starting with silverware.
 <br>
 Yes, I like this one.
 <br>
 No, Eric, the wedding book says we can&#39;t pick the first thing we see.
 <br>
 Oh, well, in that case, yeah, the first one, eh.
 <br>
 Second one, whoo-hoo! All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s wrap it up, hit the food court.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a small sampling from our collection-- prestige, exhilaration, and, oh, my personal favorite, brash.
 <br>
 Ooh.
 <br>
 Well, Fenton, you may be surprised to learn that your personal favorite is not our personal favorite.
 <br>
 But, anyway, we&#39;re done.
 <br>
 No, Eric, the wedding book says that we have to look at all the patterns.
 <br>
 Today is just a scouting trip.
 <br>
 Scouting? You know, I was asked to resign from the scouts.
 <br>
 Look, it&#39;s kind of like okay, remember before we were together and we dated, like, all those different people before we decided on each other? No, not really.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Eric, come on.
 <br>
 This is supposed to be fun.
 <br>
 Okay, look at the groom in this picture.
 <br>
 What is the difference between you and him? Um, he&#39;s a cartoon? No, he is smiling.
 <br>
 Yeah, because he&#39;s a cartoon.
 <br>
 Look, these are all the forks I have here.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll have to bring the rest up from storage.
 <br>
 I guess I&#39;ll need a forklift.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 whoo.
 <br>
 Oh, I made a funny.
 <br>
 well, it&#39;s A it&#39;s a good thing we have all day.
 <br>
 All day? Wh-- I&#39;m not spending all day in a department store.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna turn into him.
 <br>
 Okay, um, you&#39;re not as far away as you think.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to the sporting goods department.
 <br>
 Hmm, men.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t live with &#39;em well, you can.
 <br>
 But you have to keep quiet about it.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s show S06E18 Hangin&#39; out That 70&#39;s show S06E18 down the street the same old thing that you did last week not a thing to do but talk to you we&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin! Reading another one of your dirty girl books? They&#39;re not dirty, they&#39;re romantic.
 <br>
 &#34;Mutiny from behind.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah.
 <br>
 The mutiny sneaks up on her.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what it means.
 <br>
 Well, it is a wonderful book.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got pirates and action.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, oh! It has this hilarious parrot that says the most inappropriate things.
 <br>
 &#34;The pirate&#39;s vessel &#34;slowly sailed into the harbor of San Sebastian island.
 <br>
 &#34;His saucy prisoner&#39;s alabaster breasts &#34;heaving with every motion &#34;of the tall, rigid ship.
 <br>
 &#34; San Sebastian island.
 <br>
 I think I killed some commies there.
 <br>
 I just spent six hours registeringfor wedding gifts.
 <br>
 The only reason I&#39;m here now is I pretended to choke on ice cream.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret for when you&#39;re shopping with women.
 <br>
 Always pick the ugliest, worst choice, and you&#39;re off the hook.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how I got out of shopping for this couch.
 <br>
 There was an uglier couch than this? The one I picked had dragons on it.
 <br>
 Wow, you&#39;re sneaky.
 <br>
 You know, you act like you&#39;re all about brute force, but you&#39;re a finesse player, man.
 <br>
 Trust me, son.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t budge until you hear the magic words, &#34;oh, I&#39;ll justdo it myself.
 <br>
 &#34; You&#39;re done registering already? You men, you just don&#39;t know how to shop.
 <br>
 You know, your father once tried to get me to buy a couch with dragons on it.
 <br>
 Yeah I guess I&#39;m just bad at it.
 <br>
 I&#39;d much rather be forever in blue jeans, babe what do you think of this fork? Donna, I think all this stuff is too ordinary for us, you know? Let&#39;s get something bejeweled.
 <br>
 Who are you--liberace? Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m liberace.
 <br>
 Eric, this wedding is - Hey guys.
 <br>
 What&#39;s up? Oh, hey.
 <br>
 We were just talking about slutty cheerleaders in other schools.
 <br>
 You never want to talk about that.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve finally come around, darling.
 <br>
 Oh! Are those wedding gift catalogs? - Damn it.
 <br>
 For our wedding, Steven and I - Jackie, no.
 <br>
 - Steven, we have to - No.
 <br>
 - A good bride and groom - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re done.
 <br>
 Now why didn&#39;t someone do that five years ago? She used to bite.
 <br>
 Now this, okay, This is what I&#39;m talking about.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a nice fork.
 <br>
 Eric, the handle is an actual deer hoof.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s the cherokee collection.
 <br>
 Donna, that&#39;s the indian way.
 <br>
 They kill the animal, then eat it with its own paw.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? I have a new plan.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just go shopping, and then I&#39;ll show you what I pick.
 <br>
 So I don&#39;t get to go at all? Um, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll just do it by myself.
 <br>
 Yeah I guess I&#39;m just bad at it.
 <br>
 &#34;After throwing the evil pirate king overboard, &#34;the Duke turned to Lady Daphne, &#34;pulled his sword from its sheath &#34;and held it erect.
 <br>
 &#34;Lady Daphne touched it tentatively, &#34;and a shudder went through the duke.
 <br>
 &#34; So you like those books, too, mr.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 All right, fine.
 <br>
 So you know.
 <br>
 But you tell one person, and so help me god, I will chop down whatever tree you live in.
 <br>
 So I was day dreaming during this civil rights lecture at the Police Academy, and I came up with a great idea for an invention.
 <br>
 &#34;Adult strollers&#34;.
 <br>
 Why walk when someone can push you? Kelso, that&#39;s a wheel chair.
 <br>
 All right, it&#39;s official.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s been thought of! All right, what do you think of this fork? Whoa.
 <br>
 No, no, no,no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna rope me into that.
 <br>
 Just make Eric do it.
 <br>
 No, Eric&#39;s banned from doing it.
 <br>
 He actually wanted me to eat dinner with Bambi&#39;s foot.
 <br>
 What is this, the cherokee collection? Oh, well, he picked the ugliest one so you wouldn&#39;t make him go shopping.
 <br>
 It&#39;s classic.
 <br>
 I knew something was fishy.
 <br>
 He&#39;s terrified of indians.
 <br>
 Oh, he&#39;s gonna pay for this.
 <br>
 He thought he had a bad time the other day? He doesn&#39;t know what a bad time is.
 <br>
 I am gonna stop having sex with him.
 <br>
 Oh, crap, I already did that.
 <br>
 All right, look, I hate to sell him out, but the poor kid lacks subtlety.
 <br>
 He&#39;s Eric&#39;s how do I putoh, he&#39;s a bit of a rube.
 <br>
 You know, like, a little country.
 <br>
 A maroon, if you will.
 <br>
 Kelso, what&#39;s your point? Well, I&#39;m just saying you could do better.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m here, you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Nobody has to know.
 <br>
 - Kelso! - Okay, fine, you can tell two friends.
 <br>
 So I invested $11 in Kelso&#39;s adult stroller idea.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to be a millionaire.
 <br>
 Really? So, uh, if I buy one, like, who&#39;s gonna push me around? Trained bears.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s got it all figured out.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just the money man.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, where&#39;s Donna? I found this place that etches your silhouette on your china.
 <br>
 Oh, we are so doing that when we get married.
 <br>
 Steven, people can eat right off my face.
 <br>
 Then guess who&#39;s coming to dinner.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re driving me insane.
 <br>
 Look, I want you to make me a promise.
 <br>
 You will not talkabout weddings or anything wedding-related in or around The United States.
 <br>
 Fine, I won&#39;t talkabout weddings or anything wedding-related in or around the Continental United States.
 <br>
 Not the Continental  United States.
 <br>
 We&#39;re talking Hawaii and Alaska, too.
 <br>
 Fine, but if we&#39;re ever in Canada, I am going nuts! Eric, bad news.
 <br>
 A deejay at the radio station got sick, so I have to cover his shift all week.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna be able to register for wedding gifts.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Well, I guess we&#39;ll just have to live with whatever forks come in the mail willy-nilly.
 <br>
 Well, actually, you&#39;re gonna have to shop for everything.
 <br>
 - Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Back up here.
 <br>
 Who are you calling willy-nilly? Look, uh, Donna, I can&#39;t shop.
 <br>
 I have horrible taste, remember? &#34;I guess I&#39;m just bad at it.
 <br>
 &#34; You are almost unbelievably bad at it.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve decided Jackie will go shopping with you.
 <br>
 - Ohh! Yay! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 You promised Hyde that you wouldn&#39;t do any more wedding stuff.
 <br>
 Yeah, but here&#39;s the thing about me.
 <br>
 I lie.
 <br>
 So today we&#39;ll be looking at crystal.
 <br>
 You see how all the different colors intermingle without any judgment? Hmm, see that? Yeah, okay, move over, Tony Randall.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in charge.
 <br>
 Today we&#39;ll be looking at china.
 <br>
 I see you let the redhead go.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t say I&#39;m an expert on women, but I think you traded up.
 <br>
 Okay, I will lay out four possible choices.
 <br>
 You will then choose your favorite.
 <br>
 I will disregard that and choose the correct one.
 <br>
 So what will ibe doing? Oh, you will be holding my purse and eating candy.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Here, make the sugar daddy last.
 <br>
 Oh, if only someone had given me that advice four years ago.
 <br>
 This spice rack is a real mess.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like someone got drunk and put everything out of order.
 <br>
 I mean, cayenne pepper,cumin, celery salt? It&#39;s insanity.
 <br>
 Oh, Duke, I&#39;d like to show you my coconuts.
 <br>
 Well, give me a minute to raise my mast, and then we can really make some waves.
 <br>
 Not so fast! If anyone&#39;s making waves around here, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m trained in judo, hapkido and karate.
 <br>
 I can also talk about you behind your back.
 <br>
 When it gets back to you, it&#39;ll really sting.
 <br>
 So prepare to die.
 <br>
 Aah! You know, Kitty, Eric&#39;s not home.
 <br>
 We have the whole upstairs to ourselves.
 <br>
 Woulda been thinking about that the whole time.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I got another invention.
 <br>
 Bicycles with engines.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a motorcycle.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Bicycles without engines.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a bicycle.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it&#39;s got the chair on it.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re back to wheelchair.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric just called, and he&#39;s having fun shopping.
 <br>
 All right, with me, it&#39;s torture, but when I send him to pick out wedding gifts with J Pick out wedding gifts with who? Um Jehoshaphat.
 <br>
 Remember him from school? He was always you know, jumping.
 <br>
 You sent Forman out to do wedding stuff with Jackie? Look, I had to punish him, and what better way than to make him spend the day with Jackie? Yeah, she&#39;s got you there.
 <br>
 I mean, your girlfriend is annoying.
 <br>
 Plus, I used to do it with her all the time.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s gotta hurt.
 <br>
 Man, I thought I had this wedding crap taken care of.
 <br>
 Now I gotta go down to the mall.
 <br>
 Ah, and &#34;Three&#39;s Company&#34; is about to start.
 <br>
 This day&#39;s gone all to hell! What happened to my favorite blouse? A lady never talks about what happens in the bedroom.
 <br>
 Ah, looks like Red picked up some tricks from the Duke in &#34;Mutiny From Behind.
 <br>
 &#34; He read my dirty girl book? Yes, I caught him.
 <br>
 Ironically, from behind.
 <br>
 See, Eric, this is the perfect tux for you.
 <br>
 It makes you look like you actually have shoulders.
 <br>
 You know, i do look like I have shoulders.
 <br>
 - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 Why are you wearing a wedding dress? Oh, I do this every week.
 <br>
 What the hell? I cannot believe what I&#39;m seeing.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 Look, shoulders.
 <br>
 Eric, this was supposed to be our time.
 <br>
 Donna, wait.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven, I know I promised I wouldn&#39;t do any wedding stuff, and I know you&#39;re probably really mad, so just go ahead and yell.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re beautiful.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 You like me in a wedding dress, which means that someday,we&#39;re gonna get married, which means that i can talk about it.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven! Okay, I want a spring wedding, outside with white doves.
 <br>
 And I want the sun to be setting behind me so I have a halo, kind of like an angel.
 <br>
 Oh, and then wild mustangs can take us to our honeymoon in Hawaii! Oh, but your family can&#39;t come.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what? You can run, but you can&#39;t hide.
 <br>
 I know where you live! Donna what&#39;s the matter? You picked a deer-foot fork just to get out of shopping with me.
 <br>
 Oh, too obvious, huh? Yeah, no one wants hairy silverware.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t understand how you could have more fun with Jackie than with me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I mean, you know, she doesn&#39;t ask me questions.
 <br>
 She just tells me what to do.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a strange kind of freedom, but I know why the caged bird sings, Donna.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re saying the way to handle you is just take away your free will and order you around? - Donna, that&#39;s the way I was raised.
 <br>
 Eric, I can&#39;t tell you what to do because I don&#39;t even know what to do.
 <br>
 I mean, that&#39;s why I got that stupid book.
 <br>
 I hate that book.
 <br>
 Kelso was right.
 <br>
 Reading just gets you into trouble.
 <br>
 Forks don&#39;t matter to me, Eric.
 <br>
 I mean, they don&#39;t.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t.
 <br>
 In 20 years, food&#39;s just gonna be a little pill anyway.
 <br>
 Look, let&#39;s just do this whole wedding thing our way.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 What&#39;s our way? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Maybe we should ask jackie.
 <br>
 You&#39;re back with that one? Good luck.
 <br>
 <br>
