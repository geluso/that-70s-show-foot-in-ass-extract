<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Of all the dumb-ass stunts you kids ever pulled this little California adventure takes the dumb-ass cake! We are very disappointed in you, Eric.
 <br>
 Even though going to California to rescue Donna is one of the most romantic things I&#39;ve ever heard of.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 If he had gone by horse, they would have made it a movie.
 <br>
 Look, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman before you get all scary and pink I just want to say that running away to California was completely selfish and immature.
 <br>
 And, as for me, as long as I live under your roof and eat your food I should be doing things your way.
 <br>
 What a load of crap! You two are not above the law.
 <br>
 Now, Eric, hand over the keys to the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 What? Dad, no.
 <br>
 The Cruiser&#39;s my Batmobile.
 <br>
 Without it, I&#39;m just a guy in a silly outfit.
 <br>
 Now, Eric.
 <br>
 A little time apart will do you kids some good.
 <br>
 So, Donna, I transferred you to the Catholic high school- Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.
 <br>
 - What? - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 You&#39;re starting this week so you better get out your Bible and brush up on your Ten Commandments and that thing about the dwarfs.
 <br>
 ( Fez Singing ) ( Continues ) - What the hell? - Fez! ( Ends ) Wait a second.
 <br>
 You two look sweaty and guilty.
 <br>
 Have you been eating my candy? - What candy? - I didn&#39;t say &#39;&#39;candy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And I certainly don&#39;t have any candy hidden in the garage.
 <br>
 ( Monotone ) I will be in the garage.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Steven, that was way too close.
 <br>
 You need to learn to keep your hands off me.
 <br>
 Me? You&#39;re the one who can&#39;t keep her tongue to herself.
 <br>
 Please.
 <br>
 I let you fool around with me out of pity.
 <br>
 You know what your problem is? You&#39;re really cute so no one ever told you to shut your piehole.
 <br>
 You think I&#39;m cute? Shut your piehole! ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) - ( Door Opens ) - ( Footsteps ) ( Kelso ) Oh, Catholic school? That&#39;s rough.
 <br>
 - Yeah, my dad took away my slingshot- -  ( TVTheme Music ) so I&#39;m feeling it pretty bad too.
 <br>
 What were you guys doing? Uh, we&#39;re just watching, uh- This old lady&#39;s eatin&#39; a fish.
 <br>
 Look,Jackie we&#39;ve been avoiding each other.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s time we hash this thing out.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 I can see you&#39;re devastated over losing me.
 <br>
 You know what, Michael? I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Really.
 <br>
 You sound brave.
 <br>
 But inside you&#39;re a scrambled mess.
 <br>
 Just remember this.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll always be there for you in case you have any physical needs, all right? ( Groans ) Damn, Hyde.
 <br>
 What was that for? I just missed you, man.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;re actually gonna go to Catholic school? Not just Catholic school- Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.
 <br>
 That means &#39;&#39;sad forever.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Eric, we&#39;re never even gonna see each other.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 And I can&#39;t even drive you to school.
 <br>
 And we can forget about any lunchtime hokey-pokey.
 <br>
 ( Quoting Lyric ) Man, it sucks not having a car.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m gonna go drive mine.
 <br>
 - Catch you guys later.
 <br>
 - Wait, wait, Steven.
 <br>
 Where are you going? - What do you care? - I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 - ( Door Closes ) - Um you know, I just remembered that I have to go to the mall because they&#39;re having this big Monday Madness sale.
 <br>
 Jackie? It&#39;s Tuesday.
 <br>
 See? Total madness! Poor kid, trying to replace me with shopping.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Eric, what are we gonna do? I mean, if I go to this school, our senior year is ruined.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;re not even gonna graduate together.
 <br>
 You know what? Bob is not sending you to that Catholic school.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;re gonna sit down, we&#39;re gonna figure out what we&#39;re gonna do.
 <br>
 Guys? Let&#39;s get serious.
 <br>
 ( Stereo:Rock ) It&#39;s simple.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna march over there and talk to Bob.
 <br>
 I love a good march.
 <br>
 My birthday is in March.
 <br>
 And then it&#39;s on to April.
 <br>
 April showers.
 <br>
 Oh! The Seduction of Eric Forman starring in the insatiable April Showers.
 <br>
 Are you really gonna go talk to my dad for me? Eric, you&#39;re so sweet and brave.
 <br>
 Pound for pound, you&#39;re like the bravest guy in the whole world.
 <br>
 I love you so much! Well, my candy is safe.
 <br>
 But something was up with Jackie.
 <br>
 She looked scared- like a deer in the headlights with his pants down.
 <br>
 Man, I feel sorry forJackie.
 <br>
 I mean, to have to look at this all day and not be able to touch it? I can&#39;t even do that! - I love you.
 <br>
 - I love you more.
 <br>
 Sexy.
 <br>
 Hey! You two quit it! Okay? This circle is sacred.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t do anything in here that you wouldn&#39;t do in a church! No, wait.
 <br>
 In a cemetery.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 In the teachers&#39; lounge.
 <br>
 Man, I&#39;ve done it everywhere.
 <br>
 -  ( Stereo: Pop ) - Okay.
 <br>
 This is my Michael box.
 <br>
 I saved everything that loser ever gave me.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 One-year anniversary.
 <br>
 What a moron! Well, you know, I guess Kelso&#39;s really history for you.
 <br>
 I never thought that&#39;d happen till you met someone else.
 <br>
 You met someone else! ( Scoffs ) What? Someone else? That&#39;s crazy! You&#39;re crazy.
 <br>
 Shut your piehole! - ( Can Tab Pops ) - Hey, check it out.
 <br>
 I was at the bakery, and this crumb cake came fresh out of the oven.
 <br>
 And when I think crumb cake, I think Bob.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 What do you want? I want to talk to you about Donna and that Catholic school.
 <br>
 Crumb cake isn&#39;t gonna get me to change my mind.
 <br>
 Are you sure? ( Sniffs ) Those are real crumbs.
 <br>
 She&#39;s going to that school, and that&#39;s final.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But know this.
 <br>
 I am prepared to fight this with every fiber of my being.
 <br>
 ( Choir Singing ) ( Ends ) On the other hand you-you can&#39;t put a price on a good education.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re making you wear those knee-high socks every day.
 <br>
 - ( Mouths Word ) - ( Door Opens ) What the hell? Oh, my God! I&#39;m blind! -Jackie! - Get off me! Great outfit! Okay, so, um, what exactly did you see? Hands, tongues.
 <br>
 Yours, his.
 <br>
 It was horrible! You were like Siamese twins joined at the beard.
 <br>
 Hey, it was her fault, man.
 <br>
 She threw herself at me.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 You were on top of me.
 <br>
 You pulled me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done a lot of partying, so, you know my balance is off.
 <br>
 This is impossible.
 <br>
 You two hate each other.
 <br>
 - Kelso is gonna freak out! - ( Gasps ) Kelso! Settle down, Esmeralda.
 <br>
 Kelso doesn&#39;t need to know about this.
 <br>
 Yeah, look, it&#39;s just a meaningless fling, okay? We can stop whenever we want.
 <br>
 - Well, then maybe you should.
 <br>
 - Why do you even care? Because you&#39;re breaking up the band, Yoko! ( Footsteps ) Well, naughty ladies wear plaid.
 <br>
 Fez, please.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Beg for it, sexy schoolgirl.
 <br>
 Fez, we just caught these two Frenching like a couple of French people at a Frenching festival.
 <br>
 What? That&#39;s impossible.
 <br>
 You two hate each other.
 <br>
 I said- I just said that.
 <br>
 Okay, you are gonna tell us how this happened right now.
 <br>
 Ooh, I like it when you order me around in that uniform.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ll just tell you what happened.
 <br>
 It was a few weeks after Donna and Michael left and Steven invited me over to listen to a new record.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 ( Women Singing Disco ) Isn&#39;t it the coolest? Don&#39;t you just wanna shake it? - ( Needle Scratches Record ) - ( Hyde ) Wait.
 <br>
 Time out on the fiield.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t shake it, and I don&#39;t listen to ABBA.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my story.
 <br>
 Anyway- ( Resumes ) (Jackie ) I could totally tell he was trying to make a move.
 <br>
 Then he held me real close and said- May I kiss you, milady? ( Ends ) Hyde, I had no idea you could be so formal.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 She&#39;s so full of crap.
 <br>
 Then why don&#39;t you tell us what really happened, milady? Fine.
 <br>
 Fine, okay? So I&#39;m hanging out in the basement like I usually do when Jackie showed up.
 <br>
 - It was obvious she wanted me.
 <br>
 - I want you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s obvious.
 <br>
 God, that&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 No, you so came on to me first.
 <br>
 You said that you didn&#39;t have a new boyfriend.
 <br>
 - He is not my boyfriend.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not her boyfriend.
 <br>
 They just don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Why would they? Let&#39;s go, baby.
 <br>
 I&#39;m leaving too.
 <br>
 This basement&#39;s tainted for me now.
 <br>
 Well, I still want to know how the hell all this happened.
 <br>
 - ( Crowd Cheering ) -  ( Game Show Theme ) Another old lady.
 <br>
 She can&#39;t even reach the wheel! I can&#39;t watch The Price is Right again.
 <br>
 I just can&#39;t.
 <br>
 ( Bell Dings ) - God, the summer totally sucks.
 <br>
 - ( Bell Dings ) - There&#39;s nothing to do.
 <br>
 - ( Crowd Cheering ) - ( Bell Dings ) - ( Crowd Cheering ) ( Bell Dinging ) ( Woman On TV) I bid one dollar, Bob.
 <br>
 ( Crowd Booing ) ( Bell Dinging ) Hey.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna take Donna to school.
 <br>
 Oh! That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Dad took away my car when I did that really super-romantic thing.
 <br>
 Well, I guess we were only reunited just to be ripped apart again.
 <br>
 Like Romeo and Juliet.
 <br>
 You know why don&#39;t you take the car this one time? It&#39;ll be our little secret.
 <br>
 - ( Whispering ) Okay.
 <br>
 - ( Whispering ) Okay.
 <br>
 Shh! Where do you think you&#39;re going? Mom said I could.
 <br>
 - ( Keys Jingle ) - You just bought yourself another week, kiddo.
 <br>
 Look, Dad, I need my car.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you remember when you were in high school? I bet you had some good times driving around senior year with your friends.
 <br>
 My senior year, I was driving a gunboat around Okinawa.
 <br>
 And if you count theJapanese snipers as my friends then, yes, I had some good times.
 <br>
 You have to understand, Eric.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not that your father&#39;s trying to be a bad guy.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that he&#39;s been irreparably damaged by war.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just sick of you doing whatever the hell you want.
 <br>
 Your father and I feel that you&#39;re not taking yourself seriously.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 - ( Choir Vocalizing ) You are such a talented young man.
 <br>
 ( Continues ) - ( Ends ) - Eric! Oh.
 <br>
 Uh, yeah.
 <br>
 Forget about the car.
 <br>
 I gotta go.
 <br>
 Oh, look how cute in her little uniform.
 <br>
 ! I&#39;m gonna have to lock him in his room and poke his eyes out.
 <br>
 -  ( Stereo: Rock ) - Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get about Fantasy Island.
 <br>
 You know when you get off the plane, and you see Mr.
 <br>
 Roarke and that little kid in the white suit? Well, if it&#39;s me, I&#39;m like, &#39;&#39;This is creepy,&#39;&#39; right? So I just grab a free daiquiri and I&#39;m out of there.
 <br>
 - Whoa! - Whoa! ( Sighs ) Grow up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a uniform.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Oh! ( Laughing ) Oh! Man, that was totally worth waiting for.
 <br>
 - I agree.
 <br>
 Now we can go.
 <br>
 - ( Kelso Laughs ) How was your first day? Grim.
 <br>
 This nun totally spanked me with a ruler.
 <br>
 Yet another reason I wish I was a ruler.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) ( Door Closes ) - Wait a minute! - Weird! Okay.
 <br>
 Now you guys are sitting together? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You guys aren&#39;t just fooling around.
 <br>
 You care about her.
 <br>
 I do not.
 <br>
 She sickens me.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the one who&#39;s sickened, okay? I&#39;m not supposed to be seen with scruffy guys like you.
 <br>
 I date guys I can take out in public.
 <br>
 Yet you continue with this abomination! You know, you guys have to tell Kelso.
 <br>
 Or we&#39;ll tell Kelso.
 <br>
 Shall we? Wait.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 Okay, guys.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 What if we just break it off right now? - Then he never has to know.
 <br>
 - Really? Look, there&#39;s nothing to even break off, so it&#39;s fine by me.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 This is what I want to hear.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be like it never happened.
 <br>
 Donna, come.
 <br>
 Let us leave this unholy thing behind.
 <br>
 ( Door Closes ) Steven, do I really sicken you? No.
 <br>
 I sicken me because you&#39;re supposed to sicken me, but you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Well, I feel the same way.
 <br>
 I mean, I like how scruffy you are.
 <br>
 Of course you do.
 <br>
 Man, you know what? Screw it.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just do what we want, okay? - Okay.
 <br>
 What about Michael? - Details, baby.
 <br>
 Details.
 <br>
 So, uh, how&#39;s that uniform working out for you? Stop! Do you- Do you feel like a good girl that just can&#39;t help being bad? Be bad, Donna.
 <br>
 ( Whispering ) I won&#39;t tell.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s not funny.
 <br>
 I actually have to go to this school every day now.
 <br>
 Without-Without you.
 <br>
 Okay, so, you know what? We&#39;ll see each other nights and weekends and I&#39;ll come visit you at school.
 <br>
 I mean, I still have a bike.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s, like, 1 0 miles away.
 <br>
 Ten- So what? These legs were made for pedalin&#39;.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 - You&#39;ve seen my thighs.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a good boyfriend.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;You&#39;re a good boyfriend&#39;&#39; who? I&#39;m not calling you Principal Forman.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t make me get the ruler, young lady.
 <br>
 Red can take Eric&#39;s car, but he can have my car candy when he pries it from my cold, dead fingers.
 <br>
 - You were right.
 <br>
 Ten miles is nothing.
 <br>
 - ( Panting ) ( Chuckles ) Will you pick me up from school every day? Sure.
 <br>
 ( Panting ) Uh, which-which arm hurts when you&#39;re about to have a heart attack? Help!
 <br>
