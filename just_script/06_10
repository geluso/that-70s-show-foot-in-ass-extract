 Guys, there are actual stewardesses out there, and one of them talked to me.
 <br>
 I made this joke about how they just flew in And their arms must be tired.
 <br>
 Yeah, great.
 <br>
 Kelso, their neckerchiefs are undone.
 <br>
 You can see their necks.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t have time for stewardess neck.
 <br>
 I gotta study.
 <br>
 They&#39;re really riding me down at the police academy and I don&#39;t know why.
 <br>
 I know why.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun.
 <br>
 They even chose me last to work on the c.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 R.
 <br>
 Dummy, so everybody&#39;s spit was all over it.
 <br>
 Yo, even Johnson&#39;s spit, and he&#39;s got a monster cold sore.
 <br>
 I know why they&#39;re doing that.
 <br>
 I bet you&#39;re the stooge.
 <br>
 What? Every year the police academy lets one guy in they know will fail out.
 <br>
 They use him to scare the other cadets.
 <br>
 I know &#39;cause my brother was a stooge.
 <br>
 All right, fine.
 <br>
 It was me.
 <br>
 Oh, man, I&#39;m the stooge! Hey, come on.
 <br>
 Kelso, if that were true, you&#39;d have had to have been a screw-up your whole life.
 <br>
 I mean, sure, you&#39;ve fallen off the water tower Every year since junior high.
 <br>
 And you broke your arm wrestling a dog.
 <br>
 And, heck, no one&#39;s eaten more change than you.
 <br>
 All right, I gotta say, you guys are making a pretty good case that I&#39;m the stooge! Well, if you&#39;re not, there&#39;s a guy who&#39;s about to step on a rake that I really want to meet.
 <br>
 Hello, Wisconsin! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the stooge! Michael, it&#39;s just the way some people are, okay? Some people are lazy.
 <br>
 Some people are clumsy.
 <br>
 Some people are stooges.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lucky enough to be all three.
 <br>
 Kelso, keep in mind you&#39;re being called a stooge by a stooge while a third stooge sits idly by.
 <br>
 Compliment accepted.
 <br>
 Now, listen, you nincompoops.
 <br>
 These pies are for some very important clients.
 <br>
 Nothing should happen to these pies.
 <br>
 Got that? Sure thing, boss.
 <br>
 Nice going, you knucklehead.
 <br>
 Now we gotta wash &#39;em.
 <br>
 Want to give me a hand? Bravo! Bravo! Ah, so we got a wise guy, huh? Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk! Oh, yeah? Take this! How&#39;s it going with those Pies? Ugh.
 <br>
 The three stooges have such bad hair.
 <br>
 You know, I wish I could go back in time for just 10 minutes and hand out combs and brushes.
 <br>
 Guys, can we focus here? I gotta figure out if I&#39;m the stooge or not.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t you just, like, ask your Captain or something? He won&#39;t tell me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the whole point.
 <br>
 I gotta get a look at my file, which means I gotta break into the police academy.
 <br>
 Okay, you see how you took something that made sense and then made it weird? That&#39;s part of the problem.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I like about you, kelso.
 <br>
 You can make a mess out of anything.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, not me.
 <br>
 Breaking into a place where they train people to shoot you if you break into a place Come on, Eric.
 <br>
 We&#39;re a team.
 <br>
 Yeah, Michael&#39;s the looks.
 <br>
 Steven&#39;s the brain.
 <br>
 And you, your house has food.
 <br>
 Hey, remember when we shoplifted those baseball cards? We were 12 years old.
 <br>
 And I didn&#39;t shoplift anything.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 You went home and told your mommy.
 <br>
 You mama&#39;s boy.
 <br>
 Well, did you want that on your permanent record? Yeah, I didn&#39;t think so, mister.
 <br>
 Oh, God, I am a mama&#39;s boy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Now, the secret to really good Fudge is a tiny bit of Kahlua.
 <br>
 You must make a lot of Fudge, &#39;cause the bottle&#39;s almost empty.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s a tiny bit of Kahlua for the Fudge, a tiny bit for the chef.
 <br>
 Ha ha ha ha! That&#39;s how you make cooking fun.
 <br>
 Apparently, it also works for sewing and laundry and sitting around watching tv.
 <br>
 Okay, the I.
 <br>
 N.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 Called.
 <br>
 I have to go in for a final review before I can pick up my green card.
 <br>
 I bet they give you a test on U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 history.
 <br>
 See, America is strict about who we let in here &#39;cause we have stuff that people want to steal.
 <br>
 Unlike your lesser countries, like Canada and France.
 <br>
 See? This is when a Bobby pin comes in handy.
 <br>
 Why do you have a Bobby pin? I&#39;m training my hair, okay? I want more wave, less fluff.
 <br>
 Guys, this is serious.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just find my file and get out of here.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s in here? It&#39;s the k-9 training room.
 <br>
 It&#39;s where they keep all the samples to teach the police dogs what to sniff for.
 <br>
 Oh, man, these samples are way better than our samples.
 <br>
 Did you see how quickly I sniffed them out? I could so be a police dog.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Training collar.
 <br>
 You know, I still don&#39;t get how they could think I&#39;m a stooge.
 <br>
 I&#39;m, like, so on top of everything.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this thing do? Oh! Give me that, kelso! You&#39;re gonna hurt yourself.
 <br>
 Quit it, Hyde.
 <br>
 That really hurts.
 <br>
 Okay, do it one more time.
 <br>
 Okay, so this is George Washington, the father of our country.
 <br>
 Well, George and I have one thing in common.
 <br>
 We both look good in a powdered white wig.
 <br>
 Okay, so, fez, the statue of liberty was a gift from the French.
 <br>
 The French? I didn&#39;t know that.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t know that? I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s common knowledge.
 <br>
 Okay, I painted my nails through two semesters of American history, and even I knew that.
 <br>
 Well, don&#39;t I feel like the hillbilly who wandered into town.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s no big deal, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Oh, I see.
 <br>
 It&#39;s no big deal for you smart people who know everything.
 <br>
 But for us hillbillies, well, we&#39;re lucky if we know how to tie our shoes and flush the toilet.
 <br>
 Okay, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, please don&#39;t get upset.
 <br>
 Okay, here.
 <br>
 Drink some more Fudge.
 <br>
 Okay, so The constitution was ratified Oh, I know this.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re thinking of the declaration of independence.
 <br>
 See, the constitution was I know what the constitution is.
 <br>
 Can you make Fudge? What? Then can it.
 <br>
 Okay, what if they ask me about current events? Tell me about Vietnam.
 <br>
 Okay, so Vietnam was an illegal war which we lost.
 <br>
 What the hell are you teaching him? You, come with me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll teach you the real American history.
 <br>
 First of all, we didn&#39;t lose the war.
 <br>
 It was a tie.
 <br>
 Besides, they&#39;re grateful.
 <br>
 They have McDonald&#39;s now.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s my file.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t say &#34;stooge&#34; anywhere.
 <br>
 Oh, good picture, but that&#39;s no shocker.
 <br>
 But this is Aah! I think the batteries are starting to go.
 <br>
 That one didn&#39;t hurt as much.
 <br>
 You better let me hold on to this file.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t leave any fingerprints, thanks to my cool new black gloves.
 <br>
 Man, if only these shot webs.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t those your mom&#39;s isotoners? All right, guys, I gotta figure out if I&#39;m in trouble or not.
 <br>
 What the hell is going on in here? I&#39;m gonna go with you&#39;re in trouble.
 <br>
 Cadet kelso, do you know what the penalty is for breaking into the academy office? No, sir, officer Kennedy, sir! There are none, because nobody&#39;s been stupid enough to do it! All right! You&#39;re first in your class.
 <br>
 Is that a dog training collar around your neck? Oh, um, you&#39;re probably gonna want this.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the red button.
 <br>
 Look, sir, I think you should know that at the last police charity auction, my family bought one of your Christmas tree ornaments Santa driving a cop car.
 <br>
 Funniest thing on the tree.
 <br>
 It was.
 <br>
 Anyway, please don&#39;t call my mom and dad.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 What&#39;s your name? They call me fez.
 <br>
 Officer Kennedy, sir, I broke in to find out if I was the stooge or not, sir.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not the stooge.
 <br>
 Johnson&#39;s the stooge.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re the stooge now.
 <br>
 Okay, I think that we&#39;ve been reviewing long enough.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve learned.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll start you off with an easy one.
 <br>
 Where do you live? Ame-dee-ca.
 <br>
 It&#39;s pronounced America.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I said.
 <br>
 Ame-dee-ca.
 <br>
 America! Ame-dee-ca.
 <br>
 Why do we celebrate the 4th of July? Because we are damn glad not to be a bunch of British tea-drinking nancy-pants.
 <br>
 Nobody&#39;s gonna argue with that answer.
 <br>
 A-mer-I-ca! A-me-dee-ca! America! Ame-dee-ca! What was president Dwight d.
 <br>
 Eisenhower&#39;s greatest achievement? He led the allies to victory in world war ii and sent those jackbooted Nazi bastards home to cry in their Sauerkraut.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t understand a word you said, but I heard &#34;nazi bastards,&#34; and that&#39;s good enough for me.
 <br>
 America! Ame-dee-ca! Look, there is no damn &#34;d&#34; in &#34;america&#34;! Say my son&#39;s name.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Now America.
 <br>
 Ame-dee-ca.
 <br>
 Just forget it.
 <br>
 Just say &#34;united States.
 <br>
 &#34; United States Of ame-dee-ca.
 <br>
 Guys, I&#39;m really screwed down at the police academy.
 <br>
 Officer Kennedy told me he&#39;s looking for any reason to kick me out.
 <br>
 Okay, but did he say anything about calling my parents? I was so freaked out that I completely blew this exam this morning.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure you did fine.
 <br>
 Roy, the first question was &#34;stop in the name of the blank.
 <br>
 &#34; And I wrote &#34;love.
 <br>
 &#34; God! I don&#39;t care what they say, kelso.
 <br>
 Love is always the right answer.
 <br>
 So you screwed up a test, man.
 <br>
 You know what you have to do.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah, study more next time.
 <br>
 What are you, Forman? You gotta break in there and change the answers.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t break in there again.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why they&#39;ll never expect it, man.
 <br>
 Look, they don&#39;t know you got a friend like me to talk you into doing something so fundamentally moronic.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m in, too.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s dangerous, but I just really like wearing that outfit.
 <br>
 Trust me, it&#39;ll work.
 <br>
 How do you think I got through chemistry? Hey, you told me you blackmailed the teacher &#39;cause you caught him smoking up behind the gym.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 How do you think I got through biology? Fez, relax.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna pass the test.
 <br>
 No, this could be my last day in the country.
 <br>
 We should probably make love.
 <br>
 What? Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be over before you know it.
 <br>
 So, on the way back from the bathroom, I got proposed to 3 times.
 <br>
 I must look more gorgeous than usual.
 <br>
 Jackie, the only reason they want to marry you is so they can stay in the country.
 <br>
 Jealous.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Here I go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here for my test.
 <br>
 Where do I sign in, or should I say, where do I put my John hancock? Actually, I will sign my name.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just a common expression.
 <br>
 I know so much history, I just drop it into everyday conversation.
 <br>
 There is no test.
 <br>
 I just need to see that you are who you say you are and that you&#39;re in the country to be with your wife Laurie Forman.
 <br>
 No test? So that&#39;s it? I&#39;m truly really a citizen of this great country? Just as soon as I stamp this paper.
 <br>
 Oh, this is great.
 <br>
 You and I should go celebrate.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s start out with a couple of drinks and some lovemaking and see where it goes from there.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t date married men.
 <br>
 Well, let&#39;s just say that as soon as I get my green card, I will be single.
 <br>
 Then you can explore the country of fez.
 <br>
 Hold on.
 <br>
 Are you telling me your marriage is a sham? I&#39;m telling you your eyes are like Amber waves of grain.
 <br>
 You do realize I haven&#39;t stamped this yet.
 <br>
 Actually, I had not.
 <br>
 Oh, he looks happy.
 <br>
 Yeah, I bet he&#39;s doing great.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Shouldn&#39;t you stamp my paper now? I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 In a minute? Nope.
 <br>
 After lunch? Unh-unh.
 <br>
 Would you like me to stamp it? Red, do you think I&#39;m smart? Oh, is that what we&#39;re gonna do today, we&#39;re gonna fight? Great news.
 <br>
 I got my green card.
 <br>
 I am now officially a yankee doodle dandy.
 <br>
 So you passed the test, huh? No, there was no test.
 <br>
 No test? Oh, we&#39;re just as bad as Canada.
 <br>
 So, what happened? Well, you know how sometimes I come on a little strong to the ladies? You can be a little handsy.
 <br>
 It was touch-and-go for a while, but eventually, I won the I.
 <br>
 N.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 Lady over with my charm.
 <br>
 More like you cried until she felt bad and stamped your papers.
 <br>
 Hey, tomato, potato- - it&#39;s all the same thing.
 <br>
 Bottom line is I have cha-dees-ma.
 <br>
 Charisma! Yes, cha-dees-ma.
 <br>
 Man, I love these gloves.
 <br>
 I wish there was some diamond protected by lasers I could steal.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m almost done.
 <br>
 I just gotta think of one more misdemeanor.
 <br>
 Oh, breaking into the police academy.
 <br>
 All right, come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 How do you keep finding us?! I&#39;m wearing all black! I sleep right next door.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the problem, trouble with the wife? Shut up.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re outta here.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 I can explain.
 <br>
 Okay, this whole thing started because I just I can&#39;t be the stooge.
 <br>
 Okay? I&#39;m gonna be a dad soon, and no kid is gonna look up to his dad if his dad is the stooge.
 <br>
 Well, unless the kid&#39;s a stooge, in which case I wouldn&#39;t love him anyway.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna be a father? Who would breed with you?! One night stand, both a little drunk.
 <br>
 Look, I know I messed up.
 <br>
 But can&#39;t you just maybe Give me one more chance? All right.
 <br>
 Since you&#39;re gonna be a father, I&#39;m gonna let what happened here slide.
 <br>
 But just so you don&#39;t do this again, I&#39;m gonna let you in on a little secret.
 <br>
 There is no stooge.
 <br>
 What? That&#39;s just a rumor we started to get the cadets to work harder.
 <br>
 Also there&#39;s no alligator in the lake.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 If there&#39;s no stooge, then how come our friend Roy told us he got kicked out of the academy for being a stooge? Roy keene? He didn&#39;t get kicked out for being a stooge.
 <br>
 He got kicked out for shooting the police horse.
 <br>
 Look, cadet, all you have to do is work hard and you&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Now you clean up this mess and get outta here.
 <br>
 Well, I think we all learned an important lesson here.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re in trouble and your back&#39;s up against the wall, just tell &#39;em you got a kid.
 <br>
 People are suckers for a baby.
 <br>
 That is a valuable lesson.
 <br>
 I think we should all reflect on that In the k-9 training room.
 <br>
 I call shock caller.
 <br>
 I call buttons.
 <br>
 Okay, miss smarty-pants.
 <br>
 How about ooh.
 <br>
 Where was the famous tea party? Boston.
 <br>
 Nope.
 <br>
 What? Got it wrong.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the Boston tea party.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 It says right here it&#39;s &#34; the Boston tea party.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have a long island tea party.
 <br>
