<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 FezÂ I didn&#39;t say anything when you started spying on Donna I kept my mouth shut when you hid in the dirty towel bin to peep on the cheerleaders But if you get your jollies listening to people go pottyÂ I&#39;m calling a doctor.
 <br>
 Shhh, I&#39;m trying to see if Jackie&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 She&#39;s been in the bathroom for hours, crying.
 <br>
 Oh my God ! You had sex with her ! No ! She told me she wanted to be my girlfriend and I turned her down.
 <br>
 What ? Why ? Because she didn&#39;t mean it.
 <br>
 She never wanted me before.
 <br>
 And now that she&#39;s desperate, suddenly I&#39;m the guy for her.
 <br>
 But as soon as she&#39;s happy, she&#39;ll dump me.
 <br>
 So I told her to get lost and now she&#39;s in tears.
 <br>
 Well, what kind of crying is it ? Is it like &#34;my life is over&#34; kinda crying or hysterical sobbing like the time Kelso sat on his nads ? No it&#39;s bad.
 <br>
 I tried everything to get her out.
 <br>
 I yelled &#34;Fire !&#34; I made monkey-noises and said &#34;Wow that&#39;s a gigantic monkey&#34;.
 <br>
 But no luck.
 <br>
 She must be a complete wreck.
 <br>
 Oh hey guys ! Oh.
 <br>
 She&#39;s perfectly fine.
 <br>
 So you definitely didn&#39;t have sex with her.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re okay ? Oh no.
 <br>
 No I&#39;m not okay.
 <br>
 I just decided being sad is a waste of time.
 <br>
 You see, a more productive use of my time is revenge.
 <br>
 So get ready.
 <br>
 Because I am going to rain doom down on your stupid foreign head ! That didn&#39;t seem so bad Fez.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.
 <br>
 - You wouldn&#39;t ? - No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s because I&#39;m safe.
 <br>
 You should be freakin&#39; terrified.
 <br>
 That &#39;70s Show - 8x20 - Leaving home ain&#39;t easy Hey hey ! Just got back from Florida.
 <br>
 Wanna see my tan lines ? Oh, for gosh sakes, Bob ! Joke&#39;s on you ! I don&#39;t got no tan lines ! Whoohoo ! You were in Florida ? Yeah, I was gone for three weeks.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t notice ? I just figured my migraine medicine was working.
 <br>
 Uhuh.
 <br>
 Boy it was beautiful down there.
 <br>
 The ocean, the sunshine and Disneyworld is a great place to pick up single moms.
 <br>
 In fact, I like Florida so much I&#39;m selling the house and I&#39;m moving there.
 <br>
 You&#39;re selling your house ?! What if someone annoying moves in ?! I bought a condo.
 <br>
 And get ready for this I&#39;m gonna open a bait shop.
 <br>
 What a great idea That way, when the hundreds of other bait shops down there run out of stock, there you&#39;ll be ! So, you think I&#39;m stupid because I want to open a bait shop ? No, of course not ! I think you want to open a bait shop because you&#39;re stupid.
 <br>
 Well, I didn&#39;t come in here to be ridiculed.
 <br>
 Then you shouldn&#39;t have worn that shirt ! Red, you need to go over there and apologize to Bob.
 <br>
 He came here all excitd about his idea and you just made him feel bad about himself.
 <br>
 Yeah, he never saw it coming.
 <br>
 So did you get Jackie back for flushing your tootbrush down the toilet ? No.
 <br>
 Only four out of five dentists recommend brushing, so I just go to the other guy.
 <br>
 How about for micro-waving your hand-lotion ? No, the heat feels nice on my hands.
 <br>
 Well, what are you gonna do to her for ripping all of the buttons of your shirt? Thank her.
 <br>
 I look fabulous ! Man, what is wrong with you ? She tore your shirt for easy access, when Jackie gets angry, she goes straight for the nipple.
 <br>
 Hyde, I turned her down, she has every right to be angry.
 <br>
 But the worst of it is over, so I&#39;m gonna let bygones be bygones.
 <br>
 Fez, let me tell you a little story.
 <br>
 Once upon a time there was a young girl named Jackie.
 <br>
 She destroyed everything in her path cause she was Satan&#39;s child.
 <br>
 The end ! Ahhh, I see your point.
 <br>
 Wait, what&#39;s your point ? My point is she&#39;s evil man ! You gotta get back at her, you gotta fight fire with fire.
 <br>
 Are you suggesting I set her on fire ?! What has happened to you ? I&#39;m just saying that every time Jackie hurts you, you gotta hurt her worse.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, that sounds like a senseless cycle of violence.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the best and funniest kind.
 <br>
 Look this whole thing will blow over once I talk to her about everything.
 <br>
 Holy crap ! My car ! Jackie ruined my car ! And you don&#39;t have insurance.
 <br>
 Haha ! Good one, Jackie.
 <br>
 And look what she wrote on the side.
 <br>
 Fez has a tiny I do not ! It&#39;s perfectly normal based on all the other ones I&#39;ve seen.
 <br>
 I only look for comparison ! Well, if Jackie wants war, I&#39;ll give her war.
 <br>
 Whatever you say, Tiny.
 <br>
 If it&#39;s so small, why would I name it Big John ? Dad I don&#39;t wanna move to Florida.
 <br>
 - Sure you do ! - No I don&#39;t ! - C&#39;mon, who doesn&#39;t want to move to Florida ? - Me ! Oh.
 <br>
 Well, geez, you should have said that before I put the house on the market.
 <br>
 You put the house on the market ? Relax, honey, I can always take it off.
 <br>
 - You can ? - No, it sold this morning.
 <br>
 Well look who it is.
 <br>
 Come over to insult me again ? I don&#39;t know, maybe take another cheap shot at my outfit ? Okay.
 <br>
 There is nothing wrong with your outfits.
 <br>
 Red thinks they&#39;re tacky but I&#39;ve explained to him that you&#39;re just Italian.
 <br>
 Anyway, Red has something he&#39;d like to say to you.
 <br>
 Go ahead.
 <br>
 Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry that I said that your idea is stupid.
 <br>
 - AndÂ - AndÂ the next time you have a stupid idea I&#39;ll just keep my mouth shut.
 <br>
 You know what Red ? I really don&#39;t give a damn what you think.
 <br>
 All these years I&#39;d have to put up with you cutting me down calling me dumb-ass, well guess what, you&#39;re the dumb-ass ! You&#39;re nothing but a cranky *bleep* who thinks he&#39;s *bleep* his dogsday so you can blow it out your *bleep* ass ! What, what, what you wanna hit me ? Go ahead you bald *bleep* Yeah go ahead, do it, I&#39;m not afraid of you, in fact, I&#39;ll kick your boney *bleep* ass right now ! Bob, you&#39;ve got some nerve ! Good for you ! It&#39;s about time you stuck up for yourself and acted like a man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry Red it just slipped out ! I&#39;m so sorry Fez.
 <br>
 - I was just outside and I read that you have a tinyÂ- Shut it ! Fez, you gotta do something man.
 <br>
 Because Jackie is just getting started.
 <br>
 When she gets mad, she is like a revenge machine.
 <br>
 She will destroy you because she can ! Get out man ! I gotta get out ! I gotta get out ! HuhÂ flashbackÂ Vandalizing your car man ? That&#39;s disturbed.
 <br>
 I mean that car is the only thing that defines you as a man.
 <br>
 - You know, because you have such a tinyÂ- Enough ! I gotta get back at her.
 <br>
 Oh I know, I&#39;ll break her TV.
 <br>
 Ahhh but then I&#39;ll just miss Gilligan.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re gonna retaliate, you need to hit Jackie where it hurts.
 <br>
 Ahhh, like in the face ? No ! What does Jackie love the most ? Herself.
 <br>
 All she cares about is her looks.
 <br>
 You&#39;re exactly right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna buy some bleach and some razor blades and after I do my laundry and shave, I&#39;ll think of what to do to Jackie.
 <br>
 You guys are never going to believe this.
 <br>
 My Dad is moving to Florida.
 <br>
 Florida is nice.
 <br>
 My Mom spend three years down there.
 <br>
 Supposed to be five but she got time off for good behaviour.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got no place to live ! What am I gonna do ? Why don&#39;t you move in with me ? Donna ? Randy asked you a question.
 <br>
 And I for one am giddy with anticipation to hear the answer.
 <br>
 I just meant, we&#39;re dating and I&#39;ve got the room and if you got homesick I could walk around naked with my robe open like your Dad.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, I mean I never really thought about moving in.
 <br>
 I mean we hardlyÂ well I do need a place to liveÂ but you don&#39;t want me invadingÂ well we do watch the same showsÂ What the hell, sure ! Then what the hell sure it is ! Jackie is about to get out of the bathroom.
 <br>
 Wait until you see what I did to her.
 <br>
 Fez, if this is the ex-lax prank, I&#39;d rather hear about it then see it.
 <br>
 No it&#39;s better.
 <br>
 And she&#39;s turning the shower offÂ she&#39;s getting outÂ look at herself in the mirror andÂ AAAARRRGGHHHH ! FEZ ! Ho ho ho, Green Jackie ! Fez, you completely ruined my hair ! You destroyed my car ! I had every right to destroy your car, you turned me down ! You turned me down like a million times and I never did anything ! Actually I remember a lot of crying.
 <br>
 Yes I cried.
 <br>
 Because I have feelings.
 <br>
 Unlike you Jackie.
 <br>
 Oh, huhuh.
 <br>
 I have feelings.
 <br>
 And they told me to buy a bottle of spray paint and tell the whole world - that you have a tinyÂ - IT&#39;S NORMAL SIZED ! Well you know what, I&#39;m glad I turned you down.
 <br>
 Because you are a mean, bitter girl.
 <br>
 And now, you&#39;re ugly on the outside like you are ugly in the inside.
 <br>
 Holy crap man, cover your nipples ! I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s what you really think of me.
 <br>
 Well it is.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just go pack up my things and get out of your life.
 <br>
 Damn man, that was harsh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Must have been my Jamaican fire.
 <br>
 SoÂ you&#39;re from Jamaica ? No, &#34;Jamaican Fire&#34;.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my new cologne.
 <br>
 See, these blue buildings are condo&#39;s and the green ones those are cabana&#39;s.
 <br>
 What is that yellow building ? Oh that&#39;s CheeseWhiz, I was reading in bed.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 This design is great.
 <br>
 You know, the way these condo&#39;s are layed out you could spend your entire life and never have to interact with your idiot neighbours.
 <br>
 Oh, and look at the streetnames Orange Grove Avenue, Grapefruit Lane, Pineapple Road, it&#39;s like living in a fruit salad ! Anyway, I couldn&#39;t help but notice they got 200 brand new beachfront homes each with a dock, but no bait shop within five miles.
 <br>
 You can fish of your own pier ? That means you don&#39;t have to get your lines tangled up with some dumb-ass who doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing ? You&#39;re the one who invited me ! Ah, you guys should move down there too.
 <br>
 Red, Red, you could run the bait shop with me.
 <br>
 Nah, I don&#39;t think so Bob.
 <br>
 Kitty and I aren&#39;t ready to leave Point Place.
 <br>
 Okay then.
 <br>
 When I&#39;m sitting pretty there on Orange Grove Avenue you guys can enjoy the drive past Slaughterhouse Way.
 <br>
 Well that&#39;s not fair Bob.
 <br>
 It&#39;s only named that because that way leads to the slaughterhouse.
 <br>
 I think you really gonna like living here.
 <br>
 So let&#39;s take the tour, shall we ? This area over here with the underpants is the laundry annex.
 <br>
 Uh, oh, over here is the gym Membership included And through that door is the bathroom / library Although currently all we have to read is a Sports Illustrated and a bottle of Prell.
 <br>
 You okay ? Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just weird you know.
 <br>
 Moving in with someone But great Weird, but great You know, like midgets There&#39;s nothing to worry about.
 <br>
 Oh and the closet&#39;s really full, but you can just hang anything you want on the drum kit.
 <br>
 I was gonna use it but you know impulse-buy.
 <br>
 - Seriously, you&#39;re okay with this ? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Then here you go, I made you a key.
 <br>
 Put your name on the mailbox.
 <br>
 So I guess we are officially living together.
 <br>
 Uhuh.
 <br>
 Nice.
 <br>
 Heyyy, there he is.
 <br>
 Donna, this is Pickles.
 <br>
 Pickles, meet Donna.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s your new Mommy ! - Hi Mommy ! Yeah uhmÂ I gotta go ! Chick magnet my ass ! Wow man.
 <br>
 The stuff you said to Jackie.
 <br>
 So mean and hurtful.
 <br>
 I only wish I&#39;d said it myself.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad she&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never felt so happy about anything in my life.
 <br>
 What did I do ?! Jackie was in love with me and I let her go.
 <br>
 And all that I have is an empty apartment.
 <br>
 And the scent of her perfume on my boxers, where I sprayed it.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re doing the right thing.
 <br>
 I know you wanna run after her but as your friend I am not gonna let you.
 <br>
 JACKIE I&#39;M COMING !!! Hah, you can call my bluf.
 <br>
 That Bob and his crazy ideas.
 <br>
 We can never move to Florida.
 <br>
 Well it&#39;s easy for him to do.
 <br>
 But we have real ties here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m three piggie stamps away from a free ham at the supermarket ! And I&#39;ve got responsibilities.
 <br>
 Spring is coming up, who is gonna poison the new batch of squirrels ? Let&#39;s move to Florida You really want to ? - Do you ? - If you do ! - I do ! - Me too ! - Then let&#39;s do it ! - Ohohohoohhh ! Red ! I am so excited there is so much to do in Florida, it&#39;ll be such an adventure.
 <br>
 Nooo, I just wanna go down there and kinda sit around till we die.
 <br>
 Donna, come on.
 <br>
 JustÂ tell me why you left.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, it all hit me at once, I justÂ I just like needed some air.
 <br>
 Well if Pickles saying &#34;Hi Mommy&#34; freaked you out I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret.
 <br>
 That was actually me.
 <br>
 You know what, it&#39;s just this whole Florida thing is really freakin&#39; me out.
 <br>
 When you asked me to move in it seemed like the right thing to do butÂ when I got there I sort of realized that I&#39;m just doing it cause I&#39;m too afraid to start my life.
 <br>
 I used to have like plans.
 <br>
 What did you wanna do ? Go to college.
 <br>
 I got accepted in Madison last year soÂ I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s time I finally go.
 <br>
 That&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 It&#39;s only a few hours away, we can totally make that work.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 This it just isn&#39;t what I want.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 So, that&#39;s it for us ? I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 Kinda sucks.
 <br>
 Hey Donna ! Check out my new Speedo for Florida ! Dad, why can&#39;t you just buy a regular bathing suit ? Those make me look silly Jackie There you are.
 <br>
 What do you want Fez ? I ran all the way here to find you.
 <br>
 My car is in the shop.
 <br>
 And you&#39;ll be glad to hear that they are changing the word &#34;tiny&#34; to &#34;large&#34;Â - Look I don&#39;t care about any of this.
 <br>
 - Jackie wait.
 <br>
 Look I didn&#39;t mean all those horrible things I said.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not ugly, you&#39;re beautiful.
 <br>
 Even if you dumped me after a week it&#39;d be the best week of my life.
 <br>
 I just wanna be with you.
 <br>
 Fez, you really, really hurt me.
 <br>
 And I thought you were the one person who would never speak to me like that.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not the guy I thought you were, and I don&#39;t think I could ever be with with you.
 <br>
 - But Jackie - No.
 <br>
 Goodbye, Fez.
 <br>
 Oh, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, thank God you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 I just had my heart broken and I really need someone to talk to.
 <br>
