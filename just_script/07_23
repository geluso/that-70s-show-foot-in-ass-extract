<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 that&#39;s funny, eric.
 <br>
 I thought I told you to clean out the vista cruiser.
 <br>
 But what I must&#39;ve said was, &#34;go sit on your ass.
 <br>
 &#34; No, I was there, red.
 <br>
 You definitely said, &#34;go clean out the cruiser.
 <br>
 &#34; But he just insists on being defiant.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m sorry, dad, but something really important came up.
 <br>
 &#34;I dream of jeannie&#34; did her blinking thing, and now dr.
 <br>
 Bellows thinks he&#39;s a monkey, so no.
 <br>
 Dr.
 <br>
 Bellows is a monkey that thinks he&#39;s a doctor.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 He&#39;s sittin&#39; at the desk and stuff.
 <br>
 But he&#39;s a monkey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a monkey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a monkey.
 <br>
 Eric, I need that car to go pick up charlie at the airport.
 <br>
 You&#39;re bringing another guy here ? We need another guy here like I need another firecracker in my bathing suit.
 <br>
 Well, until you learn to stop wearin&#39; speedos, you&#39;re gonna keep gettin&#39; firecrackers.
 <br>
 Charlie&#39;s this annoyingly nice kid.
 <br>
 His dad and my dad were drinking buddies in the navy.
 <br>
 We weren&#39;t drinking buddies.
 <br>
 We were finely honed killing buddies.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I never liked him.
 <br>
 At the last navy picnic, we got teamed up for the egg toss.
 <br>
 And he dropped our egg on purpose just so these little sick kids could win.
 <br>
 Those little twerps went home with my goldfish-in-a-bag.
 <br>
 My goldfish-in-a-bag.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, charlie&#39;s only gonna be here a few days on business for his dad, and the last thing he needs is to be exposed to you deviants.
 <br>
 Whoa, dad, we are not deviants.
 <br>
 Jeannie&#39;s bending over ! Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Um, you guys, I gotta talk to steven about something really serious.
 <br>
 maybe she&#39;s pregnant ! Maybe she cheated on him.
 <br>
 Maybe she cheated on him and she&#39;s pregnant.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Steven, this tv producer called to tell me he loved my public access show.
 <br>
 And then he offered me a job at his station in chicago starting next week.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Um, you&#39;re gonna take a job and move to chicago ? No, no, not yet.
 <br>
 No, I wanted to talk to you about it first.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 This is &#34;serious&#34; serious, not funny serious.
 <br>
 We should probably leave.
 <br>
 But we won&#39;T.
 <br>
 Steven, this is my dream come true.
 <br>
 But you are the most important thing in the world to me.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m willing to give it all up and stay here with you.
 <br>
 But if I do that, I need to know we&#39;re gonna get married.
 <br>
 Jackie, we just agreed not to talk about our future.
 <br>
 But our future is happening right now.
 <br>
 Look, the station needs an answer by noon on sunday, and I do, too.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t know what to say right now.
 <br>
 I know this is a sensitive moment, but may I offer a word of advice ? Run ! That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 23 &#34;Take It Or Leave It&#34; Eric, you remember Charlie.
 <br>
 Well, I remember a perfectly tossed egg from me, an unconvincing &#34;whoops&#34; from him, and the sound of laughter as some children ran away with my goldfish-in-a-bag.
 <br>
 Eric, you put some kind of spin on that egg.
 <br>
 It was uncatchable, like a curveball.
 <br>
 Ha ! Your whole story&#39;s unraveling, man.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t throw a curveball.
 <br>
 Dad tell him.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to side with my son on this one.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t even throw a straight ball.
 <br>
 Charlie, I made you a pancake smiley face with sausage arms and a little scrambled egg cardigan.
 <br>
 where&#39;s my whimsical breakfast ? Oh, well, since you decided to go teach in africa without consulting me, all you get is a plain pancake breakfast with nothing smiling at you.
 <br>
 Nothing.
 <br>
 - Morning.
 <br>
 - Hey, I smell bacon.
 <br>
 Hey, boys.
 <br>
 Have you met charlie ? Oh, hey, I&#39;m kelso.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna eat your breakfast.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m fez, and just so you know, I&#39;m the coolest guy in this gang.
 <br>
 All right, I gotta go to work.
 <br>
 Charlie, if eric and his friends start to bother you, just hold up a book.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like kryptonite to them.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, donna.
 <br>
 Are you still mad about this whole africa thing ? Yep, but instead of pouting at my house and being miserable, I decided to come here and make you miserable.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the spirit, donna.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Eat his bacon.
 <br>
 - Mmm.
 <br>
 - You made me bacon ? Yep.
 <br>
 I just kept it over here in america.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 Bacon.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Who is she ? Don&#39;t even think about it.
 <br>
 Donna is with eric, and then she&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 And then she is mine.
 <br>
 And then, right back to me for another go-around.
 <br>
 Hey, hyde, I heard about jackie.
 <br>
 What are you gonna do ? W ell, I spent all morning kickin&#39; back with my stash to see what came to me.
 <br>
 But all that came to me was a great idea for a movie that now I just can&#39;t remember.
 <br>
 Is that what that smell was ? Aren&#39;t you afraid you&#39;ll get arrested ? I&#39;m  a cop.
 <br>
 You guys are crazy.
 <br>
 The closest I ever came to breaking the law was when me and my friend toby cut out of school five minutes before the last bell.
 <br>
 Whoo ! My heart was beating so fast.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you were naked ? No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 You know what, hyde? Your problem is you didn&#39;t handle jackie&#39;s ultimatum like a man.
 <br>
 Like, if donna tries that with me, I&#39;m just gonna say, &#34;hey, guess what.
 <br>
 &#34;You don&#39;t get to tell me what to do with my life.
 <br>
 &#34; And then, depending on how much steam I have left, I may even call her &#34;toots.
 <br>
 &#34; Hey, eric.
 <br>
 You know how, um, guys always ask me out, but I say no because I have a boyfriend ? It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 She won&#39;t budge.
 <br>
 Well, since you&#39;re going to africa, I figure, you know, I should be moving on with my life, too, and there&#39;s this guy named kevin where I work, and he asked me out tonight.
 <br>
 I said yes.
 <br>
 What ? You&#39;re gonna oh.
 <br>
 I think I see what&#39;s goin&#39; on here.
 <br>
 Looks like somebody&#39;s caught the ultimatum bug.
 <br>
 Okay, um, I&#39;ll play along.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna go out with this kevin guy, or what ? Or nothing.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t an ultimatum.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m prepared for an ultimatum.
 <br>
 I need to figure out what I&#39;m gonna wear.
 <br>
 Maybe that really short pink skirt.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s over at my place.
 <br>
 You have her skirt ? Don&#39;t judge me, new guy.
 <br>
 It feels so good not to be the monkey in the middle.
 <br>
 Dance, monkey, dance ! I can&#39;t believe donna&#39;s goin&#39; out with this guy from work.
 <br>
 You know, I made a point of going down there and spreading a rumor that she had crabs.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t talk to me, forman.
 <br>
 This whole thing with jackie is all your fault.
 <br>
 How ? Because I wouldn&#39;t have even been in the basement last night when jackie came over if we had gone to go play pinball like I wanted, but you wouldn&#39;t go.
 <br>
 So now I gotta figure out my entire life because you claim the change guy touched you weird.
 <br>
 He put the quarters right into my pocket.
 <br>
 I&#39;m tired of messin&#39; with charlie.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not even reachin&#39; for the ball anymore.
 <br>
 Well, you know, if you want, we can hang out at my dad&#39;s warehouse.
 <br>
 - Oh, that sounds great.
 <br>
 - Really ? No.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 I have to get down there and unlock the door.
 <br>
 We&#39;re getting a shipment today.
 <br>
 Shipment of what ? Beer.
 <br>
 My dad owns a beer warehouse.
 <br>
 Your dad owns a beer warehouse ? Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 You can touch the ball now.
 <br>
 you had to see eric&#39;s face when I told him about my date.
 <br>
 He was all nervous and surprised.
 <br>
 It reminded me of his sex face.
 <br>
 Donna, I don&#39;t wanna hear about eric&#39;s sex face.
 <br>
 I&#39;m upset enough.
 <br>
 You wanna know what the best part is ? I don&#39;t even have a date.
 <br>
 I made the whole thing up just to mess with eric&#39;s head.
 <br>
 I wish I had manipulated steven instead of opening up my heart.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m the vulnerable one waiting for his answer.
 <br>
 Yeah, I was a little surprised.
 <br>
 I mean, the bitchy stuff is your bread and butter.
 <br>
 You know, I had fake pregnancy right up my sleeve, and I didn&#39;t even use it.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Holy crap.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the most beer I&#39;ve ever seen.
 <br>
 let me just get the lights.
 <br>
 Let me rephrase that.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the most beer I&#39;ve ever seen.
 <br>
 it&#39;s the mother lode.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like now I know how the immigrants felt when they finally saw the majestic skyline of new york city.
 <br>
 Actually, eric, most of the immigrants arrived in the 19th century, before the skyline was ever built.
 <br>
 I mean beer ! Yeah ! I I I-I don&#39;t know where to start.
 <br>
 You know, the kegs are cold.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t we start with the kegs ? Hey, we&#39;ll handle this, new guy.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll start with the kegs.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothin&#39; like drinkin&#39; beer straight from the tap.
 <br>
 this must be why babies love breast-feeding.
 <br>
 reminds me of an ancient chinese proverb.
 <br>
 It goes, s omethin&#39;, somethin&#39;, somethin&#39;, crazy girlfriend.
 <br>
 Somethin&#39;, somethin&#39;, drink lots of beer.
 <br>
 Hyde, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna find the answer to our problems in a keg of beer.
 <br>
 Unless they&#39;re at the bottom, so drink up ! I&#39;ve  been in this warehouse a hundred times, and I never did this.
 <br>
 Now I know why my grandmother is an alcoholic.
 <br>
 This feels great ! I&#39;m gonna need a bigger mouth.
 <br>
 Girls, please tell me that charlie is here.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t he at your house with the guys ? No.
 <br>
 Oh, sweet lord, they got him.
 <br>
 You know, donna, you should be out there trying to keep eric from going to africa instead of sitting here on your patootie.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m doing everything I can.
 <br>
 I even lied to him and told him I was out on a date with another guy.
 <br>
 Sweetie, that&#39;s amateur hour.
 <br>
 God gave you a very full chest.
 <br>
 I suggest you start using it on my son.
 <br>
 I cannot believe eric went out.
 <br>
 He&#39;s supposed to be at home agonizing.
 <br>
 Well, maybe they went out to buy flowers for when steven proposes.
 <br>
 No, they woulda just sent fez.
 <br>
 They&#39;re out having fun.
 <br>
 And that is exactly what we&#39;re gonna do.
 <br>
 Okay, here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get why would sally sell seashells down by the seashore ? I mean, that&#39;s a terrible location for a seashell stand.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, if she wanted to make money, she would sell seashells by the subway.
 <br>
 You know what she should sell by the seashore ? Shoeshines.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause your sandals get so sandy.
 <br>
 Sandy sandals.
 <br>
 We should start a girl band called sandy sandals.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong ? Well, sand reminds me of dirt, and dirt reminds me of steven.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m sure hyde will do the right thing.
 <br>
 You know, I thought if I really put myself out there, he&#39;d see how much I love him and say yes right away.
 <br>
 And then when he didn&#39;t, I thought, okay, well, maybe he&#39;ll take a couple of hours and then say yes.
 <br>
 But now I think he&#39;s only taking so long &#39;cause he&#39;s gonna say no.
 <br>
 Donna, what if he says no ? Jackie, if hyde says no, then you and I get a van, and the sandy sandals tour america.
 <br>
 And in a nutshell, that&#39;s what it&#39;s like to be on the debate team at a catholic high school.
 <br>
 Yeah, I love catholic schoolgirls.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t teach sex ed, so they don&#39;t know what not to do.
 <br>
 Yeah, maybe.
 <br>
 Uh, but I never really got together with any of &#39;em.
 <br>
 Wait, you never okay, wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Everyone, wait.
 <br>
 Before you start in on him, let me just say, when I was a virgin, all I wanted was for one person to say it was okay.
 <br>
 And no one did.
 <br>
 - Neither will I.
 <br>
 - Freak ! O kay I finally made up my mind about jackie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna marry her.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be mrs.
 <br>
 Jackie hyde ! I think you need one more beer.
 <br>
 Could be.
 <br>
 Virgin.
 <br>
 Man, how do you not have sex with all those girls that are always throwing themselves at you ? That doesn&#39;t happen to everyone, jackass.
 <br>
 How dare she give me an ultimatum ? This is my life she&#39;s messing with.
 <br>
 She can go to hell ! I will see her in hell ! Maybe one more.
 <br>
 One more couldn&#39;t hurt.
 <br>
 Eric, I wonder what donna&#39;s doin&#39; on her date.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what, man ? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 She just wants me to come running after her, and I&#39;m not gonna do that.
 <br>
 You know what ? That is totally the right move, man.
 <br>
 Plus, it&#39;s, like, after 9:00.
 <br>
 So if you go over there now, you&#39;ll probably walk in on her and that guy slidin&#39; all over each other.
 <br>
 And if I know donna, she&#39;s moaning like a ghost.
 <br>
 Okay, donna does not moan like a ghost.
 <br>
 I could make her moan like a ghost.
 <br>
 You know what, guys ? I&#39;m a little confused, but I do know that I love you guys.
 <br>
 I really, really do.
 <br>
 Hey, where&#39;d kelso go ? Well, hello, toots.
 <br>
 Back from your date so soon, huh ? Used to be you had to buy a girl dinner if you want her to slide all over you, moaning like a ghost.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what ? I didn&#39;t have a date.
 <br>
 But I should&#39;ve.
 <br>
 - Wait, so you lied ? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I was pissed.
 <br>
 I mean, all of a sudden, you&#39;re leaving me.
 <br>
 Well, look, I&#39;m only gonna be gone for a year.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want you to go.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;ve always been, like, What am I supposed to do without you ? Look, donna, this is gonna be really tough for both of us.
 <br>
 But, hey, you know what ? The good news is, when I come back, we&#39;re gonna spend all this time together because, you know, you&#39;re probably gonna have to nurse me back to health from some horrible african disease.
 <br>
 Look you know I love you.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re wasting our time fighting.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 We should just enjoy the time we have left.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m all for that.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s not what I had in mind, but okay.
 <br>
 Wait, eric, you&#39;re back.
 <br>
 Um, where&#39;s steven ? Uh okay, he&#39;s passed out in the back of a beer warehouse.
 <br>
 You mean he&#39;s not coming.
 <br>
 He&#39;s gonna say no.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Oh, jackie, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 What ? I&#39;m too drunk anyway.
 <br>
 All right, you two.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s charlie ? Look, dad, not so loud, okay ? We We had a really rough night.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s  charlie ?! Who is charlie ? Last time I saw him, he was on a stack of kegs claiming mount schlitz for the U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 Oh, crap.
 <br>
 And he was a good kid.
 <br>
 Now who am I gonna spend time with ? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Me ? Don&#39;t be a smart-ass.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s almost noon.
 <br>
 Guess I gotta go talk to jackie.
 <br>
 What are you gonna tell her ? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m thinkin&#39; about lettin&#39; the el camino make the final decision.
 <br>
 If it pulls to the left, marriage, pulls to the right, nudie bar.
 <br>
 So you haven&#39;t decided ? No, I&#39;ve decided.
 <br>
 Steven jackie stopped by and asked me to give you this note.
 <br>
 oh.
 <br>
 It says she took the job in chicago and she left this morning.
 <br>
 Oh, you poor baby.
 <br>
 You know what ? I am gonna turn my back and let you go into the kitchen and have a beer.
 <br>
 that better be charlie.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, is this your daughter ? I don&#39;t know who did this to him, but they sure are clever.
 <br>
 They put you in a dress, huh ? Welcome to Point Place.
 <br>
 listen, charlie, about last night, I know you&#39;re thinking you&#39;re getting picked on a lot.
 <br>
 Hey, I know you guys were just havin&#39; some fun.
 <br>
 Let me finish.
 <br>
 Around here, I&#39;m the whipping boy.
 <br>
 Not you, me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Let me finish.
 <br>
 I do the drinking and I put on the dresses.
 <br>
 You got it, hotshot ? Got it.
 <br>
 Would you let me finish ?! I&#39;m finished.
 <br>
 <br>
