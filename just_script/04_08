 ( Old English Folk ) - Oh, Wanda.
 <br>
 - Oh, Derek.
 <br>
 - Oh, Wanda.
 <br>
 - Yes, Derek? You&#39;re not just my next-door neighbor.
 <br>
 You&#39;re also the love of my life.
 <br>
 Derek, I, too, have strong feelings of love for you but I have to give back this promise ball and chain.
 <br>
 I must leave Point Upon the Place and explore the world with my trusty cat named Sir Bonkers.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll never let you go.
 <br>
 - ( Thunderclap ) - You can&#39;t make me stay.
 <br>
 - Oh, no? What if I told you that I&#39;ve run over the cat named Sir Bonkers and the cat named Sir Bonkers is no more? Now submit and be my wife! ( Thunderclap ) Derek, once you were a kind, peaceful man but love has made you wicked.
 <br>
 Oh, I am wicked.
 <br>
 And until you agree to be my wife I will scour the earth in search of cats named &#39;&#39;Sir Bonkers&#39;&#39; and I will kill them all! Or at very least, spray them with water which everyone knows they hate.
 <br>
 ( Thunderclap ) ( Maniacal Laughing ) ( Laughing Continues ) I can&#39;t believe Donna would publish this in the school paper.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 This could be in Reader&#39;s Digest.
 <br>
 It&#39;s that good.
 <br>
 Oh, this is the worst short story by an ex-girlfriend in a school newspaper ever.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! ( Man Singing Soul ) ( Ends ) Well, if it isn&#39;t Playboy reading, panty-loving, cat-killing Derek.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 How could Donna write this? Why are you upset? It&#39;s this Derek guy who really gets the shaft.
 <br>
 Fez, I am Derek.
 <br>
 Everything always has to be about you.
 <br>
 Fez, man, think about it.
 <br>
 Eric killed Donna&#39;s cat.
 <br>
 Derek killed Wanda&#39;s cat.
 <br>
 Donna found panties in Eric&#39;s Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 Wanda found a chastity belt in Derek&#39;s Vista Carriage.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys, you know what goes really good with a bad short story? Pinball! - No.
 <br>
 I hate pinball.
 <br>
 - Hate it or love it? - Hate it.
 <br>
 - Or love it? Come on, guys.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna buy a so let&#39;s play so I can make some money.
 <br>
 Where&#39;d you get $50? - From Jackie.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Oh, hey,Jackie.
 <br>
 Can I borrow $50? - For what? - To buy a dress for you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Eric, Derek.
 <br>
 Panties, chastity belt.
 <br>
 Dead cat, dead cat.
 <br>
 Oh-ho-ho! I still got nothing.
 <br>
 Come on, Red.
 <br>
 Bob really wants us to meet his new lady friend.
 <br>
 Now, think about it, Kitty.
 <br>
 She likes Bob.
 <br>
 I have a hard time believing this woman even exists.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna get over there, Bob&#39;s gonna be sittin&#39; in a rocker with a lady&#39;s wig on.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;You look lovely tonight, Bob.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;So do you, Bob.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; You&#39;ve been working on that all day, haven&#39;t you? Yeah.
 <br>
 Red, Kitty, I&#39;d like you to meet a very special lady-Joanne.
 <br>
 Well,Joanne, it is so nice to meet you.
 <br>
 - Right, Red? - We can&#39;t stay long.
 <br>
 Ah, Red.
 <br>
 Bob warned me you can be a pain in the ass.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) ( Bob Laughing ) Well, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll just have dinner and if it turns out you don&#39;t like me, we&#39;ll never invite you over again.
 <br>
 Really? I like you already.
 <br>
 Well, let&#39;s get this barbecue started.
 <br>
 Bob, grab that meat.
 <br>
 Oh, I got it, Red.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you fellas make a salad? ( Laughs ) Salad.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re serious.
 <br>
 No, see, Bob and I do the grilling.
 <br>
 Not this time.
 <br>
 Kitty, you wanna give me a hand? - Well, I&#39;d love to.
 <br>
 - Oh, I don&#39;t think- But, Kitty, you might set your lovely hair on fire.
 <br>
 Well, it can&#39;t be that hard.
 <br>
 You do it.
 <br>
 Bob, what the hell&#39;s goin&#39; on here? Look, Red, I really like this woman so please, for today, just shut it.
 <br>
 Shut it? Good God, Bob! Is she teaching you to stand up for yourself? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Well, cut it out! I want to have a nice time.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give you first dibs on the aprons.
 <br>
 You want the fake tuxedo or the fake hairy chest? Oh, damn it.
 <br>
 Give me the tuxedo! Whoo-hoo! Hairy chest is Joanne&#39;s favorite.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) It&#39;s probably &#39;cause she&#39;s got one.
 <br>
 Ah! Well, if it isn&#39;t the wielder of the poison pen.
 <br>
 - Didn&#39;t you like my story? - No.
 <br>
 No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I said &#39;&#39;poison pen&#39;&#39; not &#39;&#39;marshmallow pen.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughs ) What? - This story is about us.
 <br>
 - No, it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 You took stuff from our life and put &#39;em in your story.
 <br>
 ( Lowers Voice ) Like the time you found those Playboys under my bed.
 <br>
 ( Cat Screeches ) Begone, Sir Bonkers.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Derek, look what I found under your bed.
 <br>
 Lewd renderings of naked serving wenches.
 <br>
 Did you commission these? So what if I did? I have needs, woman.
 <br>
 Now, ready thyself.
 <br>
 On this night we fornicate.
 <br>
 Okay, well, maybe there are some similarities.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s what writers do.
 <br>
 I mean, we take stuff from our lives.
 <br>
 Yeah, but you made me mean all the time, and that&#39;s mean.
 <br>
 Okay, maybe I exaggerated some stuff &#39;cause, you know, I&#39;m writing this for stupid high school girls.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! Great story! ( Man Singing Rock ) Michael, Steven just told me that instead of buying me a dress you spent my $50 on this stupid machine.
 <br>
 Jackie, I did not.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, I did.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Jackie, listen.
 <br>
 There&#39;s an old saying: You buy a girl a dress, and she looks pretty for one night.
 <br>
 But you buy her boyfriend a pinball machine, and she looks pretty for life.
 <br>
 Okay, there&#39;s another old saying, Michael: You&#39;re dumb as dirt.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 That was in the yearbook.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Listen, listen.
 <br>
 So, I bought a half stake in this machine, all right? So that means for every quarter I put into it, I get half back.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a 50% profit! Uh, actually, Kelso, I think that&#39;s a 50% loss.
 <br>
 Fez, I know it&#39;s hard for a foreigner to understand our complicated capitalist system.
 <br>
 But we&#39;re dealing with quarters here, not frogs or chickens.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not going to dignify that with a response because I can&#39;t think of one.
 <br>
 But when I do, a good day to you.
 <br>
 - All right, Fez.
 <br>
 Y- - I said, kiss my ass.
 <br>
 So, you still mad? No.
 <br>
 No reason to be mad.
 <br>
 Your story is just a pathetic attempt to rewrite history and make yourself look good.
 <br>
 I&#39;m pretty sure everyone&#39;s gonna know who the dill-hole is here.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s just a story.
 <br>
 No one&#39;s gonna think anybody&#39;s a dill-hole.
 <br>
 - Cat killer! - Bastard! - Porn freak! - ( Scoffs ) Okay, they could be talking about anybody.
 <br>
 Hey, we&#39;re all porn-freak bastards but he&#39;s the only one who killed a cat.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 This school obviously needs to hear the Eric Forman version of things A.
 <br>
 K.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 the truth.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna write my own story.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m throwing down the gauntlet, baby.
 <br>
 Really? Okay, smarty, what&#39;s a gauntlet? A gauntlet? What&#39;s a gauntlet? ( Snickers ) What&#39;s a gauntlet? I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s down, lady.
 <br>
 - Boy, this chicken&#39;s delish.
 <br>
 What a chef.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) You really know your way around a grill,Joanne.
 <br>
 Mine&#39;s dry.
 <br>
 No, it isn&#39;t.
 <br>
 It&#39;s tender and delicious.
 <br>
 Maybe if I chewed it with some water.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s the hose.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t like her anymore.
 <br>
 - Well, I do.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;m chopping vegetables Bob&#39;s telling me to shut it you&#39;re over there grilling with Susan B.
 <br>
 damn Anthony.
 <br>
 Well, fine, Red.
 <br>
 If it bothers you we can invite them over, and you can do the grilling.
 <br>
 But for now, I&#39;d really appreciate it if you&#39;d just shut it.
 <br>
 If one more person tells me to shut it- What? You might actually shut it? Please, Wanda, you don&#39;t have to boil me alive.
 <br>
 Killing your cat was just a horrible accident.
 <br>
 I know, but I&#39;m a witch.
 <br>
 Dear God, why is a nice, sensitive guy like me dating a lying, manipulative witch like you? Well, maybe it&#39;s because even witches have itches.
 <br>
 All is forgiven! God, why do all my stories end like that? Don&#39;t stop.
 <br>
 I like where you were going.
 <br>
 All right, guys.
 <br>
 It is time to make a withdrawal from the First National Bank of Pinball.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 No one&#39;s playing.
 <br>
 Well, I would&#39;ve played, but my frogs and chickens wouldn&#39;t fit into the slot.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I know what the problem is here.
 <br>
 This thing has been here for so long that people have forgotten about it.
 <br>
 I just need to advertise.
 <br>
 So,Jackie, put on a bikini and stand in front of the machine.
 <br>
 Michael, I am not wearing a bikini in here.
 <br>
 It would cause a riot.
 <br>
 Okay, what if I just put up flyers with a picture of you in a bikini? Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;ll still draw a crowd but at least they&#39;ll remain orderly.
 <br>
 Okay, so I just need some Magic Markers and a picture of you in a bikini.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I have one.
 <br>
 Keep it.
 <br>
 I have plenty.
 <br>
 So, guys, check out my story.
 <br>
 I passed out a bunch of copies at lunch today.
 <br>
 Oh, Forman, this kind of thing always blows up in your face.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t ever stop doing it.
 <br>
 What the hell is this? Oh, you- you didn&#39;t like my story? Oh, yeah, I loved it.
 <br>
 Especially this part.
 <br>
 Wanda, I have performed every task thou hath asketh of me.
 <br>
 Please, can we finally consummate our love? I beseech you.
 <br>
 Well, I said I would.
 <br>
 So I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 But I beseeched you.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s consummate.
 <br>
 - Really? - No.
 <br>
 Please.
 <br>
 I beseech you.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Really? No.
 <br>
 Now rub my enormous feet.
 <br>
 Um, guys, I don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 What does &#39;&#39;consummate&#39;&#39;mean? It means to have sex.
 <br>
 Really? Now I have two words for that.
 <br>
 Eric, you just wrote this to hurt me.
 <br>
 What? I did not! And, hey, so did you.
 <br>
 Look, when I wrote my story, I just sat down, and that&#39;s what came out.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t, like, plan it or anything.
 <br>
 And besides- No, you know what? I don&#39;t have to explain myself to you.
 <br>
 ( Door Opens, Closes ) Okay, I&#39;d like someone to explain it to me.
 <br>
 Uh, well, that&#39;s easy, Fez.
 <br>
 See, Donna, as an artist wrote her story to get some perspective on her life.
 <br>
 Forman, as a vindictive ass wrote his story to be a vindictive ass.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, I think you just consummated yourself.
 <br>
 See what I did there? Looks easy, but it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 Well, steaks are a-cookin&#39;.
 <br>
 Ah, what should we have to go with dinner? Oh, I know.
 <br>
 How about a salad? Say,Joanne, why don&#39;t you make the salad? - No, thanks.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Aww.
 <br>
 Make the salad.
 <br>
 Unless you don&#39;t like to do lady jobs.
 <br>
 Red, put this in your mouth.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? I&#39;ll make the salad.
 <br>
 Heh! - Sit down, Bob.
 <br>
 - Sit down, Bob.
 <br>
 - I&#39;d love to make a salad.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 As soon as Red admits he&#39;s not asking me to make a salad he&#39;s trying to put me in my place.
 <br>
 You are woman.
 <br>
 I hear you roar.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re so threatened by something as trivial as me grilling chicken.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not trivial.
 <br>
 Men grill.
 <br>
 It&#39;s been that way since the first caveman bonked a woolly mammoth on the head and threw it on the barbecue.
 <br>
 And his cave wife made the salad.
 <br>
 - I smell something burning.
 <br>
 - Oh, darn! Well, if you didn&#39;t want it well done, you should&#39;ve said something.
 <br>
 What the hell! Where&#39;s my pinball machine? Oh, where, indeed? ( Laughing ) I remember.
 <br>
 I convinced the owner that pinball was out, and Space Invaders was in.
 <br>
 Fez, why would you stab me in the back like that? Well, rest assured, Kelso, your frogs and chickens comment had nothing to do with it.
 <br>
 Well, why then? Hey, Eric, we&#39;re sorry we called you a cat-killer bastard porn freak.
 <br>
 Oh, so, you read my story, huh? No, we read part two of Donna&#39;s story.
 <br>
 The ending is so beautiful.
 <br>
 Part- Huh? Beauti-What? &#39;&#39;And as Wanda walked away, she knew in her heart she would never stop loving Derek.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Wow, that&#39;s good writing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s emotional, and it screws you.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey, so, uh, funny thing.
 <br>
 Um, your story had a second part, huh? Yeah, the paper broke it in half, &#39;cause it was too long.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, uh, you know, maybe my story has a second part too.
 <br>
 Eric, your story ended with, &#39;&#39;And he never saw that crazy bitch again.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Well, you know, that was just a prequel to a story entitled, uh &#39;&#39;He Did See That Crazy Bitch Again, and She Was a Delight.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Okay, I was- I was pretty mad when I wrote that.
 <br>
 Eric, I didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings but I guess I was mad when I wrote mine too.
 <br>
 At least when I started.
 <br>
 But once I got all that stuff off my chest, I mean, I felt better about us- more like the second half of my story.
 <br>
 So, uh- So what happens to Derek and Wanda? Well, in the story, they went off on their own adventures.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, that&#39;s probably good for them.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s probably time they moved on.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 Derek&#39;s gonna be fine.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a smart guy.
 <br>
 The wenches love him.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, Wanda&#39;s gonna do great too.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, sure.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll get all the wenches she wants.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, Donna, there&#39;s your story.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;Wanda and the Dirty Wenches.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - ( Laughing ) - Shut up.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a movie.
 <br>
 Uh! Oh, Fez, I can&#39;t hold my feelings inside any longer.
 <br>
 Yes, we must finally tell you how much we desire you.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s not just us, Fez.
 <br>
 ( Shuddering Chuckle ) Oh, I knew it all along.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s consummate me.
 <br>
 Ahh, oh, boy.
 <br>
 This is the best story ever.
 <br>
