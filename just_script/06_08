 Gooood morning.
 <br>
 - Try good 13:30.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just so worn out from carrying around all this tip money.
 <br>
 Here you go, mom.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you, kick up the thermostat couple deegres on me.
 <br>
 Well,thank you honey.
 <br>
 And you have been such a big help working yourself nearly to death.
 <br>
 I made you your special sandwich.
 <br>
 - Oooh, &#34;the Eric McSweady&#34;.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a regular sandwich.
 <br>
 Hold the masculinity.
 <br>
 It&#39;s almost time for Red&#39;s doctors appointment.
 <br>
 I have to iron his underware.
 <br>
 No crust, check, extra jelly, check.
 <br>
 My mommy loves me.
 <br>
 Check.
 <br>
 Eric, wow you look beat.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I was working until like 1:00 last night.
 <br>
 - Oh, my poor baby.
 <br>
 I know something that will cheer you up.
 <br>
 Today, I got my first bridal magazine.
 <br>
 We can spend the whole afternoon talking about wedding stuff.
 <br>
 Like, the groomsmen can wear kilts.
 <br>
 Donna, you know how much I&#39;d love to spend or clothes, or clothes for the wedding, but, God I&#39;m so beat from last night.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you go back to bad,and I&#39;ll crawl up with you after class, but this time sweep the bed for GI Joes, cause that last thing that happened that was unpleasant.
 <br>
 Life is a cabaret, my friend! You didn&#39;t work untill 1:00.
 <br>
 We got off at 22:00 and played poker.
 <br>
 Hyde, let&#39;s not wear ourselves down with the truth here.
 <br>
 When I started working full time, I thought that my life was gonna be a total grind, but my mom, Donna, they can&#39;t do enaugh for me.
 <br>
 Look at this.
 <br>
 Heart shaped sandwiches.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s giving me sexy naps.
 <br>
 As God is my witness I will never go hungry or horny again.
 <br>
 Will you please wear the ironed underware.
 <br>
 I have a reputation to protect.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re driving me to my doctors appointment.
 <br>
 Please, put on pants.
 <br>
 Eric is a little tired from working so late, so I found someone else to drive you.
 <br>
 Jump in Smokey, Bandit&#39;s on the move.
 <br>
 Okay Brooke.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s the thing.
 <br>
 We should date.
 <br>
 - Michael, I&#39;m pregnant with your child.
 <br>
 Pretty much the best and  worst things about dating have allready happened to us.
 <br>
 Okay, but we missed out on all the in between.
 <br>
 Like.
 <br>
 Okay, we need to spice up our illegitimate pregnancy with a little romance.
 <br>
 I mean, look how much we have in common.
 <br>
 You are having my baby, and I am the father of your baby.
 <br>
 Okay look, don&#39;t pretend you wanna go out with me just because you feel guilty.
 <br>
 Brooke, I wanna go out with you cause you&#39;re hot.
 <br>
 Okay fine, but I&#39;m not hot.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve gain six pounds.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay, cause it&#39;s mostly in your boobs.
 <br>
 See, nature does this to keep us guys around while you gals chunk out.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s get couple of things straight.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna be here, you don&#39;t wanna be here.
 <br>
 - I wan&#39;t to be here.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna be here, and I don&#39;t care what you want.
 <br>
 Okay then.
 <br>
 Are you buckled up? - Yes.
 <br>
 Hmm, because the little blinking man on the dashboard says you aren&#39;t.
 <br>
 Buckle up.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Look, start this car or I&#39;m gonna pack you in the crate, take you down to the port and trade you for a year supply of bananas.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - You awake? Well, if I were asleep there&#39;d be six of you all making out with yourselves.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t belive how late you must stay at the restaurant.
 <br>
 - Well, you know that grated cheese you like so much? Gets grated the night before.
 <br>
 Yeah, little thing we like to call &#34;prep&#34;, so.
 <br>
 - I love it when you use restourant talk.
 <br>
 Donna, I have to warn you, I&#39;m exhausted.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re gonna have to do all the work.
 <br>
 Why should today be any different? I need to know what to do on a first date with a women who is carrying my child? Hold her while she weeps.
 <br>
 Hey wait, what if you guys came to dinner with me and Brooke? It would make easier to find stuff to talk about.
 <br>
 - No, no man, there is no way I&#39;m going on a date with your ex girlfriend who is now my girlfiend, and your new girlfriend who doesn&#39;t wanna be your girlfriend, but is pregnant with your child.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like hillbilly territory.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll pay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Well then i have to go find something to wear.
 <br>
 I mean i&#39;m happy that Brooke&#39;s gonna have a father for her baby and all, but I still have to look prettier than her.
 <br>
 Well I was woken from my afternooon nap by my girlfriend for some afternoon delight, afterwhich i took another afternoon nap.
 <br>
 You know what i have right in the palm of my hand? - No one wants to know that.
 <br>
 Just wash up.
 <br>
 The secret of life.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m taking this one step further, fellas.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna get fat.
 <br>
 Yeah, i&#39;ll never be strong, but i think i can be fat.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a pretty thought.
 <br>
 C&#39;mon, Fez, don&#39;t be scared.
 <br>
 Go say &#34;hi&#34;.
 <br>
 No, he&#39;s too fat.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know where his face is.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t eat you.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t even move.
 <br>
 Watch! That tickles.
 <br>
 Aaah, something&#39;s poking me.
 <br>
 GI Joe.
 <br>
 There you are.
 <br>
 What else is in there? Kelso! I thought you moved away! - I&#39;ve been living on crumbs! Alright, okay.
 <br>
 Laugh all you want but all I see is a guy who doesn&#39;t have to go out of bed to go to the bathroom And that&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 Hey look there&#39;s the &#34;Oaks Lodge&#34;.
 <br>
 Pull over.
 <br>
 But i thought we would celebrate your good checkup.
 <br>
 There&#39;s this pie down at the coffee shop I&#39;ve been flirting with for days.
 <br>
 How about this for a celebration, I&#39;m going in there with my budies and you wait in the car.
 <br>
 - But that does not sound like fun.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s how we celebrate in America.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s head for home.
 <br>
 So now you&#39;re not gonna talk? - Why should I talk? My feelings are obviously of no consequence to you.
 <br>
 Alright, maybe I stayed a little longer then I expected.
 <br>
 Hey look, how about we stop for some pie? - No.
 <br>
 Oh c&#39;mon, let me get you a pie.
 <br>
 - I am not in the mood.
 <br>
 Oh just let me buy you a - There will be no pie! Wow, good pot.
 <br>
 There&#39;s gotta be like 4 or 5 bucks in there.
 <br>
 Yeah you guys are going down.
 <br>
 I gotta a full house.
 <br>
 I mean What do I got? Why don&#39;t you bet a lot and see.
 <br>
 Kelso, I know you think you got a full house, but you&#39;re only holding two cards.
 <br>
 So I&#39;ll raise.
 <br>
 This is great.
 <br>
 It&#39;s I&#39;m not alone.
 <br>
 This is great.
 <br>
 Guys I don&#39;t wanna brag but my belt is getting pretty tight.
 <br>
 I think operation &#34;Fat Eric&#34; is well under way.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing? You told me you were working.
 <br>
 I brought you brownies because you told me you were working your ass off.
 <br>
 And now it turns out you were spending all the time, we could have spent together, with the guys.
 <br>
 And, I gave you daytime sex.
 <br>
 Alright.
 <br>
 Who brought brownies? Is Eric upstairs? - Just look for the lump under the cover sucking his thumb.
 <br>
 Hey, you gonna yell? - No, I&#39;m past yelling.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s past yelling? It&#39;s the dark side of the moon, my friend.
 <br>
 The place so ugly if it was a women even you wouldn&#39;t have sex with her.
 <br>
 Ahh, that&#39;s bad.
 <br>
 How can you sleep untill noon after what happened last night? I&#39;m exhausted from loving you so much.
 <br>
 You&#39;re completely regressing.
 <br>
 You lie around all day and you act if you&#39;d be happy to stay in your mothers house forever.
 <br>
 - Look Donna, let me make it up to you.
 <br>
 There&#39;s some tip money on the dresser.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you go buy yourself something pretty? Don&#39; worry, we can still hear! Eric, what is happening to you? - Look Donna, I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m not regressing.
 <br>
 You gotta understand I&#39;m the man of this house now.
 <br>
 Okay, who is ready for a Spidey and a sandwich? - Me! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, your son is a big lazy chump because you keep babying him.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t baby him.
 <br>
 Is there a crust on that sandwich? Well of course not.
 <br>
 Crusts are icky they make Eric sicky.
 <br>
 Oh my God, I&#39;m ruining him.
 <br>
 Eric, things are gonna change around here, drastically.
 <br>
 Tomarrow you are getting a sandwich whith crust on.
 <br>
 And no more crazy straws.
 <br>
 You will be drinking your chocolate milk from a standard straw.
 <br>
 Now, who&#39;s hungry? - I call sandwich.
 <br>
 - I call Spidey.
 <br>
 I call sandwiches you haven&#39;t made yet.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna I get it, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - No, that&#39;s not gonna cut it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been wearing this engagement ring so long it&#39;s white under there, and a little wrinkly.
 <br>
 You haven&#39;t brought up the wedding in weeks.
 <br>
 I stayed home from college to be with you.
 <br>
 And if i knew you were gonna act like this, I would have gone.
 <br>
 - You right.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 Donna, I know that I&#39;m lucky to be with you.
 <br>
 Hell, when we go out together, people think I&#39;m your little brother.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 They say I shouldn&#39;t have you out so late.
 <br>
 You are right.
 <br>
 No, you are absolutely right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really, really sorry.
 <br>
 Okay? So, are you still mad at me? Well, it&#39;s kind of hard when you keep agreeing with me.
 <br>
 I agree.
 <br>
 - Stop it.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re beautiful.
 <br>
 - I will kick your ass.
 <br>
 So, maybe a good way to break the ice would be for everyone to tell a few things about themselves.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go first I like makeup and diets, and Steven here likes black things and throwing stuff at glass.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, I was valedictorian at my class, I ran marathons and I tutor kids in Latin.
 <br>
 Well, I egged the valedictorian of my class and a marathon runner.
 <br>
 Oh, and some kids that took Latin.
 <br>
 This is fun.
 <br>
 So, how do you guys all know eachother? - Well, Michael and I dated for like 3 years.
 <br>
 Then I stole her from him.
 <br>
 - Wait what? You never could have stolen from me if I hadn&#39;t cheated on her first.
 <br>
 Okay, wait a minute - That sounds a lot worse than what it is.
 <br>
 I only cheated on her with Erics sister.
 <br>
 Well, and then the rest of the girls when we were on a break cause I annoyed her, but none of those girls were anybodies sister.
 <br>
 Except for the two that were sisters.
 <br>
 He brought up the sisters.
 <br>
 Awsome.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 This was a mistake.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna go.
 <br>
 - No, Brooke wait.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been with a lot of chicks, a lot a lot a lot.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s not helping.
 <br>
 - Brooke, just let me start over, okay? We might not be a perfect match, okay, but I really, really like you and I think us having this baby together is like faith.
 <br>
 Michael, faith is when two people meet on a train or in Paris, not in a bathroom at a Molly Hatchet concert.
 <br>
 Faith.
 <br>
 Man, never use a word in a fight if you don&#39;t really really knows what it means.
 <br>
 Still not speaking to me? Fine, I&#39;ll speak.
 <br>
 I spent all day running your bold, grumpy ass around town.
 <br>
 And do I get a thanks? No.
 <br>
 Because you&#39;re unpleasant.
 <br>
 You wanna know why I&#39;m unpleasant? I just had a heart attack, and now I have to be driven around like a useless dope by the idiot that marry my daughter and gave me the heart attack in the first place.
 <br>
 But I am also unpleasant because I just spent the entire day cooped up in the car, breathing that mustard gas that you call cologne.
 <br>
 But mostly I&#39;m unpleasant because that&#39;s how it works in this family.
 <br>
 I&#39;m family? Oh crap.
 <br>
 Guys, everything is totally cool.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve promised to stop acting like such an ass, and give Donna only presents, not cash.
 <br>
 Why is that? - Because presents are for girlfriends and cash is for hookers.
 <br>
 Although - You&#39;re so good I should pay you.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 You should&#39;ve seen it coming Forman.
 <br>
 Cause when you&#39;re deeply, trully happy, it&#39;s a sure sign you&#39;re doing everything wrong.
 <br>
 It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Once Steven&#39;s unhappy, I know our relationship is in good shape.
 <br>
 Well, then we&#39;ve been tip top since the minute i&#39;ve meet you.
 <br>
 Yeah, I couldn&#39;t be unhappier about me and Brooke, so I know I&#39;m doing the right thing.
 <br>
 Cause the misery is how God lets you know you&#39;re on track.
 <br>
 And how.
 <br>
 Red and I are miserable together, and that crazy bastard is nuts about me.
 <br>
 Donna,what are you doing the day after your birthday? - Nursing a hangover.
 <br>
 You might wanna stick to light beer.
 <br>
 Cause I was thinking maybe we could get married that day.
 <br>
 Oh my God, are you setting a date? You can&#39;t set a date in a circle.
 <br>
 I can and I did.
 <br>
 - I love you.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no groping in the circle! We made that rule for Fez, but i goes for everyone! Oh, c&#39;mon Eric take charge, grab her like you mean it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 Brooke? Holly crap! That&#39;s the girl you got pregnant? She&#39;s hot! Do you think we could talk alone for a minute? Sure, I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 But just know if it doesn&#39;t work out with him, I&#39;ve got dental for all dependents.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re funny.
 <br>
 - I love you.
 <br>
 Goodbye.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a things to do.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why what happened happened.
 <br>
 I mean it could&#39;ve been faith, it could&#39;ve been the Colt 45s, but I do know you&#39;re beeing very sweet, and I could probably use a hand, cause to tell you do truth I&#39;m kind of scared.
 <br>
 That&#39;s perfect cause I&#39;m terrified.
 <br>
 I know, I mean it&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re having a baby! - I know! And we have no clue! - None at all! So, can I call you tomarrow? - Yes.
 <br>
 Before you go I just wanted to say, I don&#39;t love you.
 <br>
 I just kind of get nervous in front of women.
 <br>
 I blurr.
 <br>
 I understand and I think it&#39;s very sweet.
 <br>
 - I love you.
 <br>
 What is wrong with me? Hi Roy.
 <br>
 - Hello Brooke.
 <br>
 Hi Roy.
 <br>
 - Hello Brooke.
 <br>
 HI, Roy.
 <br>
 - Hello, Brooke.
 <br>
 I got this.
 <br>
 Hi Roy.
 <br>
 - I love you.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 - Roy, that&#39;s the freezer.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
