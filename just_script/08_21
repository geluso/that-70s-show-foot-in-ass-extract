<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Ok, don&#39;t mind us girls, we are just prettying up the room because we&#39;re showing the house later today.
 <br>
 The listing said &#34;finished basement&#34; andÂ.
 <br>
 finished ! Well we&#39;re not gonna be selling anything if we don&#39;t get rid of all this clutter, so uh get the hell out.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t leave yet.
 <br>
 I told Fez I&#39;d meet him here.
 <br>
 He went to the airport to pick up his best friend from back home.
 <br>
 Oh great.
 <br>
 Another mocca-skinned weirdo in tight pants who can make any word sounds like boogadaboogadaboogada.
 <br>
 You know he is coming to cheer Fez up.
 <br>
 The poor guy hasn&#39;t been himself since you rejected him.
 <br>
 You know it&#39;s weird, I actually miss his chocolaty stained finger prints on my bras.
 <br>
 Yeah well you know what ? I don&#39;t wanna see Fez.
 <br>
 I mean, he called me ugly on the inside and the outside.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry but he&#39;s just wrong about the outside part.
 <br>
 - Holy crap man.
 <br>
 - What ? Listen to this letter from my Dad &#34;Dear valued Grooves-employee, your services are no longer required.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve sold the chain of stores to a dry-cleaning corporation for frankly a buttload of money.
 <br>
 You should see the cheque, whoo-y.
 <br>
 I thank you for your years of dedicated service.
 <br>
 As of Friday, you&#39;re tresspassing.
 <br>
 &#34; Can you believe this man, I&#39;m out of a job ! Well how do you think Leo feels ? Well, probably how he always feels.
 <br>
 Stoned.
 <br>
 Everyone, I&#39;d like you to meet my best friend from back home : Andrew Davis.
 <br>
 How do you do ? It&#39;s so wonderful to be state-side.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re Fez&#39; friend ? FromÂ wherever he&#39;s from ? Yes.
 <br>
 And I know exactly who you are.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a frigid, unpleasant woman who enjoys stomping on a man&#39;s heart for sport.
 <br>
 You disgust me Jackie.
 <br>
 Uh.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I&#39;m not Jackie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Donna.
 <br>
 Well you are gorgeous.
 <br>
 SoooÂ you guys are from the same place ? Of course not.
 <br>
 He&#39;s from the westside of the island.
 <br>
 That &#39;70s Show - 8x21 - Love of my life You know, enough of this jibberjabber.
 <br>
 I brought you folks a gift from back homeÂ.
 <br>
 Pretty good gift eh ? Take it easy though, a little goes a long way.
 <br>
 You know what else goes a long way, man ? A lot ! You know what else goes a long way ? Spiders.
 <br>
 That little guy made it all the way from the lightbulb to the pipe.
 <br>
 Way to go Mr.
 <br>
 Spider ! Don&#39;t even think about it Andrew.
 <br>
 Spiders here have very little meat.
 <br>
 Regardless, it&#39;s still so exciting to be in America.
 <br>
 It&#39;s true what they say.
 <br>
 The streets are paved ! I&#39;m starting to feel weird guys.
 <br>
 My hair is tingly My palms are sweating and my pulse is racing.
 <br>
 Ow men I think I overdid it ! Stop jibberjabbering old boy.
 <br>
 I told you the stuff was pretty strong.
 <br>
 Just take a deep breath and relax.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be okay after a few minutes.
 <br>
 Until then, just continue to sweat and grind your teeth.
 <br>
 Or you can do what you usually do when you&#39;ve had too much.
 <br>
 Switch to beer.
 <br>
 Wow Hyde, are you okay ?! Of course I&#39;m okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you that&#39;s not okay.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re meÂ so if you&#39;re not okay it means I&#39;m not okay which means I&#39;m going out of my freakin&#39; mind here ! You&#39;re gonna be fine.
 <br>
 Do you guys think I should change my hair ? Okay, well, the house is all set Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Dubois should be here any minute.
 <br>
 Dubois ? Kitty, I don&#39;t want Germans moving in here ! I think they&#39;re French.
 <br>
 Yes, and if they buy the house, they&#39;ll give it up to the first German who knocks at the door.
 <br>
 Okay well I have to get to work.
 <br>
 Are you sure you can show this house by yourself ? Kitty, I showed a Japanese soldier the inside of his own stomach I think I can show a house.
 <br>
 So, through there&#39;s the den, back there is the kitchen and upstairs are the bedrooms.
 <br>
 Could we see them ? Oh, so my word&#39;s not good enough ? Well is there a bathroom upstairs ? No, we just whiz off the roof.
 <br>
 In here you got the stove and the fridge, both still under warranty.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Is this the kitchen ? No It&#39;s a petting zoo.
 <br>
 There&#39;s the goat Pony-ride.
 <br>
 Ah, there&#39;s the dumbass ! In here I built a whole workbench against this wall so there is plenty of space for all your tools.
 <br>
 Actually I was thinking I could turn it into a yoga-studio.
 <br>
 Really And I was thinking I could turn your-ass-into-my-foot-studio.
 <br>
 Randy ! What are you doing here ? Your Dad invited me over.
 <br>
 I figured if you two talked, maybe you&#39;d get back together.
 <br>
 I mean, it didn&#39;t work for your Mom and me but that was mostly because of sleeping with strangers.
 <br>
 Oh, so all of a sudden aunt Jenny is a stranger ?! Donna I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t even want to see me right now, but I never had a chance to tell you how I feel.
 <br>
 Straight from the heart, my own words.
 <br>
 So I made you this mixed tape.
 <br>
 &#34;Grandma&#39;s last words&#34;Â Oh I taped over that.
 <br>
 You really couldn&#39;t hear over the respirator anyway.
 <br>
 Oh Red.
 <br>
 How did it go showing the house ? Why don&#39;t you ask all the dumbasses that came through here ?! So poorly thenÂ Maybe I should show the house.
 <br>
 I heard that you&#39;re supposed to make a home feel warm and friendly and inviting.
 <br>
 So you should probably leave.
 <br>
 Yeah I just don&#39;t have the patience for these people.
 <br>
 I hate to admit it, but I wish they were all dead.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you Leo, yesterday in the basement I had the worst trip I&#39;ve ever had.
 <br>
 Hey, I don&#39;t care how bad your trip was, man you better have brought me back a snow-globe or something.
 <br>
 It was a total freak-out man.
 <br>
 I had this hallucination that eveyone else turned into me.
 <br>
 It was me, and a whole bunch of me&#39;s ! Was I there ? No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it Leo.
 <br>
 You know what ? I&#39;m quitting the circle man.
 <br>
 And I feel really good about it.
 <br>
 In fact, this calls for a celebration ! I have no idea what to do How can I turn down Jackie Burkhart ? I don&#39;t even hang up my wrong numbers ?! Look, since there&#39;s no chance of anything with her why are you even sticking around here anymore ? Well, where else would I go ? Home old boy ! Come home.
 <br>
 Home ? Yeah, that&#39;s a good idea ! I&#39;ll go back to Brazil and then I&#39;ll catch a flight home from there.
 <br>
 Oh, coming ! Oh hello there.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Kitty Forman, I&#39;m so excited to show you my home.
 <br>
 Okay now, this is the living room where I have spend many happy hoursÂ Not &#34;happy hours&#34; like, at a bar.
 <br>
 Although I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t try to start that up around here.
 <br>
 No, but I have spend many wonderful times with the kids in here.
 <br>
 Before they moved so very far away.
 <br>
 Oh sad ! Okay follow me.
 <br>
 And this is my kitchen.
 <br>
 And this is the table where Eric would do his homework and Laurie would do her nails.
 <br>
 You know some people used to call her a tramp but that&#39;s not fair there&#39;s nothing wrong with being friendly.
 <br>
 You know, I guess the four of us will never sit here together againÂ Okay, let&#39;s move on.
 <br>
 Now this is the dining room where we&#39;d have all our special dinners.
 <br>
 And Red&#39;s mother used to always tell me my pot-roast is too dry but what does she know she&#39;s in hell now You know I uh I always thought that I would serve dinner to my grandchildren in here.
 <br>
 Oh my gosh, I&#39;m just choking up.
 <br>
 Okay, uhm and here, okay this is the den.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Uhm And these are the marks on the wall where we measured the kids height when they were growing upÂ But you&#39;ll probably you&#39;ll justÂ.
 <br>
 paint over this You unfeeling bastards ! Yeah ! You will get this house when you pry it from my cold, dead fingersÂ Oh in fact, let me show you one more thing, the door ! Hey Steven, what are you doing ? I&#39;m painting this model I just finished.
 <br>
 I have a lot more free time now that I have quit the circle.
 <br>
 WÂ you quit the circle ?! What are youÂhigh ?! I don&#39;t do that anymore Jackie.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need to.
 <br>
 Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m going for a jog Oh, and if you see Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman can you let her know that I&#39;ll be making the salad tonight ? Oh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you I&#39;m here to get some things belonging to the man whose heart you broke.
 <br>
 Cause he&#39;s packing and leaving.
 <br>
 Now who is this Kitty and where is her underwear ? Wait, wait, wait, Fez is leaving ? Why ? Oh because of you.
 <br>
 He is in bad shape Jackie.
 <br>
 W he hurt me first ! Do you know what he told me ? He said that if he could go back in time and take back five words, those words would be : Now you&#39;re ugly on the outside, just like you are on the inside.
 <br>
 That&#39;s more then five words.
 <br>
 All his words run together, he doesn&#39;t know.
 <br>
 So I said to him why would you want to take those words back ? And he said to me so he wouldn&#39;t have to go through life knowing he&#39;d hurt the woman he loved.
 <br>
 And you broke his heart.
 <br>
 You disgust me ! I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 IÂI frankly don&#39;t understand why any man would ever want to be with you.
 <br>
 SoÂ.
 <br>
 want to make out ? So what do you think ? Look I justÂI think we both need to move on with our lives.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Oh well.
 <br>
 I gave it a shot.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re making a big mistake, because I am the best thing that is ever gonna happen to you Really ? Still nothing ? Huh.
 <br>
 So, friends then ? Alright.
 <br>
 Hey guys What&#39;s going on ? Steven.
 <br>
 We need to talk man.
 <br>
 We&#39;re here because we are your friends and we love you.
 <br>
 But ever since you quit the circle, you&#39;ve changed.
 <br>
 I mean, what&#39;s this I hear about you eating a vegetable ?! Look at you.
 <br>
 Your eyes are clear, your shirt is clean.
 <br>
 I hardly recognize you.
 <br>
 You have a problem with drugs man.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have a problem ! I can start any time I want ! Oh yeah ? Then why don&#39;t you start right now ? Or don&#39;t you have the guts ? You guys don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 The last time I was in the circle, I totally freaked out ! I know why you freaked out man.
 <br>
 All your friends are leaving and the recordstore is closing.
 <br>
 Your life is changing man.
 <br>
 See it&#39;s not the circle that&#39;s the problem.
 <br>
 It&#39;s that your life is crap.
 <br>
 Oh my God.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been using sobriety as a crutch.
 <br>
 I need help ! We&#39;re here for you.
 <br>
 Hold out your hands man I love you guys ! Red, I have bad news.
 <br>
 The people I showed the house to, they just weren&#39;t interested.
 <br>
 I have no idea why.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t matter.
 <br>
 The clown who does yoga made an offer.
 <br>
 So I said, it&#39;s a deal, you downward-facing dumbass.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it great ?! A month from now, we&#39;ll be in Florida.
 <br>
 YeahÂ Far away from all our family and friends.
 <br>
 Ah Jeez Kitty put it like that we should leave tonight ! Hey there son ! WBÂ Ah I guess you heard the news, huh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well I got some more great news for ya.
 <br>
 I bought a Corvette ! Good for you man.
 <br>
 You know you didn&#39;t have to come all the way down here to tell me that.
 <br>
 You could have just sent it in a form letter.
 <br>
 &#34;Dear employee, bought a Corvette.
 <br>
 Whoo-yyyy !&#34;.
 <br>
 Listen Steven, that letter was just for the faceless employees that I don&#39;t even care about.
 <br>
 Hey thanks for the letter man.
 <br>
 Look, I wanted to come here personally to tell you the big news.
 <br>
 I&#39;m giving you this store.
 <br>
 Yes, you&#39;re the proud owner of the last remaining Grooves.
 <br>
 Holy crap, I own this place ? Yep.
 <br>
 You can even rename it something more appropriate to this lilly-white community.
 <br>
 You can call it Rhythm-less.
 <br>
 Or Snap-At-The-Wrong-Time.
 <br>
 Wow man.
 <br>
 It&#39;sÂ it&#39;s like the nicest thing anyone of my Dad&#39;s has ever done for me.
 <br>
 You know, this goes to show you if you sit on your ass long enough, good stuff will happen.
 <br>
 Yup.
 <br>
 That is some good stuff.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve missed you Hyde.
 <br>
 Just like they always say, hey Leo, how&#39;s it going ? Son, if this is how you gonna run this store now that it&#39;s yours I gotta tell ya I&#39;m gonna be stopping by a lot more often ! Oh Fez, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re still here.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I wanted to take one last look at the basement before I leave.
 <br>
 Look Fez, Andrew told me what you said.
 <br>
 And now that I know, I can&#39;t let you leave.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry Jackie.
 <br>
 It&#39;s too late.
 <br>
 I&#39;m leaving.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing anybody can say to get me to stay.
 <br>
 I wanna be your girlfriend.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll stay.
 <br>
 - You will ?! Yes.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t wanna be just some rebound for you.
 <br>
 And I need to know that you&#39;re not gonna leave me when something better comes along.
 <br>
 Fez there is no-one better for me then you ! I&#39;m just sorry that it took me so long to figure that out.
 <br>
 You really mean that ? Of course ! Fez, I wanna be with you And I&#39;m so happy that we can finally be together.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been waiting so long to hear those three words Man, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m not gonna be around to see you two together.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be one of two ways.
 <br>
 It could be a disaster or a catastrofy.
 <br>
 Blablabla, you always say you&#39;re leaving, but you never do.
 <br>
 I am serious, I&#39;m finally gonna get out of this town and do something with my life.
 <br>
 Eric called, he&#39;s coming home, he&#39;s coming home ! Yeah, you&#39;re not going anywhere.
 <br>
 So you grew up with Fez, huh ? You know, we&#39;ve been wondering something for a long time Where the hell are you guys from ? Uhm, isn&#39;t it obvious ? Okay, just tell us what&#39;s the name of your country ? Well, that depends on wether you ask the British or the Dutch.
 <br>
 Okay, so what if we ask the British ? Oh no no no.
 <br>
 They wouldn&#39;t tell you.
 <br>
 They hate us.
 <br>
 Soooo What if we ask the Dutch ? Oh, who can understand a word they say ?!
 <br>
