 - Are you ready? - Yes.
 <br>
 Too slow.
 <br>
 Oh, I see how this game is done.
 <br>
 Now my turn.
 <br>
 Ready? Yeah.
 <br>
 Too slow.
 <br>
 No, Fez, that&#39;s not how the game works.
 <br>
 You&#39;re supposed to hit my hands.
 <br>
 Too slow.
 <br>
 Who wants cookies? Cool.
 <br>
 - Thank you very much.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re carob.
 <br>
 Nature&#39;s chocolate.
 <br>
 - I think not.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 You wouldn&#39;t have known if I hadn&#39;t told you.
 <br>
 Eric, I picked out a really snazzy outfit for you to wear on Career Day.
 <br>
 That&#39;s goody.
 <br>
 Fine, Mr.
 <br>
 Grumpy but I can&#39;t wait to show off my little man at work.
 <br>
 You know what? Me neither.
 <br>
 Help me.
 <br>
 Why Career Day, man? It&#39;s so lame.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just &#39;cause your mom&#39;s the lunch lady.
 <br>
 Your mom is Gross Edna? I mean, cool.
 <br>
 You bet it&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I&#39;m spending the day with Hyde and his mom.
 <br>
 Right? - Eric, I need you in the garage.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 You can explain exactly what you did to this car.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.
 <br>
 Hold the light steady.
 <br>
 Higher.
 <br>
 Higher.
 <br>
 Not in my eyes! Do I look like a carburetor? Not in this light.
 <br>
 That&#39;s one.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re in high school.
 <br>
 You&#39;d think they&#39;d take and show you how to hold a damned flashlight! Dad, isn&#39;t that what college is for? That&#39;s two.
 <br>
 You wanna go for three? Give me that.
 <br>
 See, the damn thing is shot.
 <br>
 I need a rebuild kit.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll work on this tomorrow.
 <br>
 - Dad, tomorrow&#39;s Career Day.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I&#39;m working half-days.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be home by noon.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna go to the hospital with mom.
 <br>
 Yeah, what for? It&#39;s Career Day, not Career Half-Day.
 <br>
 Okay, look, that&#39;s not three, that&#39;s what my teacher said Fine, Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll fix the car and you go with your mom and see if you want to be a nurse.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Okay, so, now, this is my ward.
 <br>
 I have to check with the night nurse.
 <br>
 You say hi to the girls.
 <br>
 Hi, girls.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 You must be Eric.
 <br>
 I recognize you from all the pictures.
 <br>
 Your face has cleared up real nice.
 <br>
 Thanks for noticing that.
 <br>
 You know, your mom does the work of five nurses.
 <br>
 This place would fall apart without her.
 <br>
 - And she&#39;s so funny! - Yeah, she is.
 <br>
 Wait, no, she&#39;s not.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 And she draws these funny cartoons.
 <br>
 See? Now, I warn you, it&#39;s a little racy, but Oh, honey, you don&#39;t need to see that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, a certain body part has been shoved up another body part for comic effect.
 <br>
 So have you met everybody? Nurse Forman, I just talked to the lab.
 <br>
 Why didn&#39;t you bring down that blood sample? Because you didn&#39;t give it to me? I most certainly did.
 <br>
 Next time I have something to give you, you tell me.
 <br>
 Will do.
 <br>
 What is his problem? Well, you all know my theory.
 <br>
 - Edna.
 <br>
 - Steven.
 <br>
 Fez, this is, my mom.
 <br>
 Nice to meet you, Mrs.
 <br>
 Gross Edna.
 <br>
 No, honey.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Miss Gross Edna.
 <br>
 You see, Mr.
 <br>
 Gross Edna ran off with Miss Perfect Ass.
 <br>
 But she can laugh about it now.
 <br>
 Yes, she can.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 I am so excited to be in the food service industry.
 <br>
 May I cut the cheese? Is he kidding? We can never tell.
 <br>
 Knock yourself out.
 <br>
 But if you cut off a finger, you&#39;re out of here.
 <br>
 Steven, you can start by slicing pizza.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here as an observer.
 <br>
 A fly on the wall.
 <br>
 One of many.
 <br>
 What a surprise.
 <br>
 Lazy, just like your father.
 <br>
 No, actually, I&#39;m lazy in a way that&#39;s entirely my own.
 <br>
 You two are hilarious.
 <br>
 - Here, put these on.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not wearing these.
 <br>
 Crap, sorry, don&#39;t blame me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the stupid Those health codes.
 <br>
 May I keep these? Sure, baby.
 <br>
 This is so cool.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s office.
 <br>
 Dad&#39;s desk.
 <br>
 Dad&#39;s phone, ding-ding.
 <br>
 My dad.
 <br>
 Yeah, I love this.
 <br>
 Yeah, Michael, this is where all the magic happens.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s get started.
 <br>
 Question number one: &#34;What&#39;s your job?&#34; I&#39;m a senior executive, statistical analysis technician.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re a senior execu-what? - In plain English I concatenate diverse statistical information to maximize the potential utilization of data.
 <br>
 So you give people data? You know, a lot of people think that.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 My job&#39;s not about output, it&#39;s about throughput.
 <br>
 So you throughput data? Now you&#39;ve lost me, son.
 <br>
 Listen, Michael you know the eight-tracks you love so much? You make them? No.
 <br>
 But because of us, other people who make them are able to make them better.
 <br>
 So you fix stuff? You could say that.
 <br>
 But I wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 You picked a good day to do this, Donna.
 <br>
 We&#39;re starting a three-day promotional sale.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll finally get to see why they call me Bargain Bob.
 <br>
 Yeah, Dad, &#39;cause that&#39;s been a real stumper.
 <br>
 You&#39;re such a cutie.
 <br>
 You keep your eyes peeled and your pencil sharp because you&#39;re gonna learn how a serious businessman operates.
 <br>
 Good, the clowns are here.
 <br>
 Hello, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, what are you doing home? That&#39;s right, you&#39;re only working part-time.
 <br>
 If it makes you feel any better, my dad feels really, really sorry for you.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t you supposed to be at Career Day? No, I&#39;m a sophomore.
 <br>
 I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t know that about me.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 My mistake.
 <br>
 Listen, while you&#39;re here, why don&#39;t you hold this flashlight on that carburetor there.
 <br>
 Like this? My God.
 <br>
 One of you is not useless.
 <br>
 A world of careers is waiting for you.
 <br>
 Talk to your guidance counselor today.
 <br>
 These people are ready for the jobs of tomorrow.
 <br>
 Are you? Good morning! This is my son.
 <br>
 He&#39;s making my rounds with me.
 <br>
 You let me know if this gets to be too much for you.
 <br>
 Okay, Mom, I think that I can handle it Good God! What is that? Remember this the next time you want a skateboard.
 <br>
 I have some bad news.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I have some good news.
 <br>
 Okay, now push! Ma&#39;am, you&#39;re hurting me.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know what pain is! Okay.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 This is the performance index before my involvement.
 <br>
 And this is after.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re responsible for this.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t credit me with that.
 <br>
 That&#39;s probably a statistical anomaly.
 <br>
 But you made the chart, right? I wish.
 <br>
 So do I.
 <br>
 Okay, question number three: &#34;Was the food service industry your first career choice?&#34; Heck, no, Fez.
 <br>
 I always wanted to go into show biz.
 <br>
 In fact, I was in the Tommy Bartlett water show at the Wisconsin Dells.
 <br>
 Yes, women waterskiing in bikinis.
 <br>
 Very erotic.
 <br>
 Anyway I was the top girl on the pyramid when they fired me for getting knocked up.
 <br>
 Let me finish this one for you, Edna.
 <br>
 Fez, this is the story where I ruin my mother&#39;s fabulous water skiing career.
 <br>
 Yeah, you did.
 <br>
 They said a pregnant girl on water skis would make the audience nervous.
 <br>
 Not to mention, you were probably hideously fat.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I looked great.
 <br>
 I kept my weight down by smoking.
 <br>
 See, that&#39;s that maternal instinct kicking in again.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re damn right I&#39;m maternal.
 <br>
 - I raised you alone.
 <br>
 - Alone? Hardly.
 <br>
 There was &#34;uncle&#34; Chet, and &#34;uncle&#34; Larry and yeah, &#34;uncle&#34; hot tub Johnny.
 <br>
 I suppose I should&#39;ve just become a nun when your father walked out on me.
 <br>
 Hell, he must&#39;ve been crazy to leave all this.
 <br>
 Always a smart ass, Steven.
 <br>
 Just like your father.
 <br>
 You know what? One thing he did do right: He left! All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right, Steven, just walk.
 <br>
 Just like everyone else.
 <br>
 Okay, question number four: &#34;Would you say you are a people person?&#34; Come on, Jackie! Harder! Come on, give it all you got.
 <br>
 - Yeah! - My God, I did it! I did it! I&#39;m changing a tire! I feel like Nancy Drew.
 <br>
 A girl needs to know what to do in an emergency.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m surprised your father hasn&#39;t taught you this already.
 <br>
 Yeah Daddy works really hard, so he doesn&#39;t spend a lot of time with me.
 <br>
 But he did promise me a Mustang for my birthday.
 <br>
 So I love him.
 <br>
 You know, Jackie, I&#39;ve been a father a long time so trust me when I tell you this.
 <br>
 The Mustang&#39;s front end is problematic.
 <br>
 Get yourself a Firebird.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s start Mr.
 <br>
 Harris on a full course of penicillin.
 <br>
 Doctor, you might want to consider erythromycin.
 <br>
 And why would I want to do that, nurse? It&#39;s just that, Mr.
 <br>
 Harris is allergic to penicillin and I thought erythromycin might make him a touch less dead.
 <br>
 I know that when I go to the hospital, I like to not die.
 <br>
 Okay do you have customers? No, they&#39;re more like clients.
 <br>
 - But you have clients? - Sort of.
 <br>
 And you provide them a product? It&#39;s more like a service.
 <br>
 A service? Not To maximize the potential utilization of the data? If we did that, we&#39;d go out of business.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Forman around? No, he&#39;s with his mom for Career Day.
 <br>
 Which is where you&#39;re supposed to be.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the deal? Man.
 <br>
 Edna&#39;s riding me again about being just like my dad.
 <br>
 So I just took off.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t your dad take off? Irony.
 <br>
 Far out.
 <br>
 Look, you and your mom have a bad history.
 <br>
 And neither of you can nurture the other&#39;s self esteem because you&#39;ve both been damaged by past criticism and shame.
 <br>
 Are you okay? I&#39;m working half-days, so I watch a lot of Donahue.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m not sure, but I think I found the u-joint.
 <br>
 - God bless you, Jackie.
 <br>
 - Okay, I&#39;m going back in.
 <br>
 Could someone help me get Mr.
 <br>
 Anderson on the gurney, please? I&#39;ll give you a hand, Mom.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s wrong with him? - He&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 - Oh, my What? Didn&#39;t we just see this guy a half an hour ago? Honey, he was dead then.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry you didn&#39;t get a chance to meet him.
 <br>
 Wait, Mr.
 <br>
 Anderson? Isn&#39;t this the guy you always talked about at dinner? The guy whose daughter just got married? Yeah, he just showed me the pictures.
 <br>
 It was a beautiful wedding.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna miss him.
 <br>
 So, okay, you grab that end, and let&#39;s get moving.
 <br>
 We have to serve dinner in 20 minutes.
 <br>
 And then we look at the chi square here apply the standard deviation here and correlate the results with the actualization median here.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s what I do.
 <br>
 And I can&#39;t make it any clearer than that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just gonna say you&#39;re a farmer.
 <br>
 Okay, next question: &#34;What has this job taught you?&#34; One thing I&#39;ve learned: Midgets make money.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why, but people see a midget, they wanna buy a blender.
 <br>
 I guess it reminds them that life is short.
 <br>
 Write.
 <br>
 Marketing is important.
 <br>
 Know your customer.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not what I said.
 <br>
 None of this is what I said.
 <br>
 Sure it is, Dad.
 <br>
 I mean, I just cleaned up the language a bit to make you sound more dignified.
 <br>
 Dignified? What are you saying? You&#39;re embarrassed by me? What have I ever done that&#39;s embarrassing? Just look around.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Let me tell you what I see.
 <br>
 You see clowns, I see your tuition at Harvard.
 <br>
 You see your dad as a ringmaster, I see you going to grad school.
 <br>
 You see a chimpanzee in a tutu.
 <br>
 Okay, that just makes me laugh.
 <br>
 The chimp is cute.
 <br>
 The point is, Donna, you&#39;re capable of great things.
 <br>
 And if this is what I have to do so you can achieve them then that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.
 <br>
 Dad.
 <br>
 I feel really bad.
 <br>
 Nobody feels really bad around Bargain Bob! Unless you got bit by a monkey.
 <br>
 Bad, bad, blood, blood is taking you for a ride the only good thing about bad blood is letting it slide Mom, how do you do this every day? You&#39;re running around and people are sick and dying I mean, poor Mr.
 <br>
 Anderson.
 <br>
 Look, you knew this guy, Mom.
 <br>
 How do you deal with all this? Here we go now.
 <br>
 - Bad - Bad - Blood - Blood The bitch is in her smile The lie is on her lips Such an evil child What are you doing? Throwing out the disgusting used meat.
 <br>
 No, sweetie, you&#39;ve gotta toss that in the chili bucket.
 <br>
 The chili bucket? - I thought that was the garbage.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Have you thrown a lot in there? Some.
 <br>
 Most things just break down in there.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Steven, you came back.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know what that means to me.
 <br>
 - Yeah? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Honey, could you clean up those pizza trays? I&#39;m gonna skip out early.
 <br>
 Guess what I did in the chili bucket? Go ahead, guess.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not being a very good mom, am I? No.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;ve got a better idea.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do something together.
 <br>
 Come on, I&#39;ll buy you a beer.
 <br>
 A beer? - Yeah, that actually sounds good.
 <br>
 - You got your fake ID? - You know it.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s my boy.
 <br>
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, whoa.
 <br>
 &#34;Autumn is harvest time for the farmer.
 <br>
 &#34;At dawn, my dad and I were out in the field &#34;picking carrots fresh off the trees.
 <br>
 &#34; Kelso, carrots don&#39;t That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 You should put that down.
 <br>
 So, what do you guys want to do when you graduate? Not touch dead people, ever.
 <br>
 I want to go back to my homeland with all that knowledge I have learned in Wisconsin and rule with an iron fist.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 - Hi, Eric.
 <br>
 How was Career Day? - It was good.
 <br>
 I learned a lot.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re going to learn something else.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s gonna teach you how to hold a flashlight.
 <br>
 Jackie? Yeah, I finally found one of your friends I like.
 <br>
 Jackie isn&#39;t really one of my friends.
 <br>
 That&#39;s one.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how you do that.
 <br>
 <br>
