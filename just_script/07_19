 Okay, the game is &#34;password.
 <br>
 &#34; The box says, &#34;using one-word clues, &#34;get your partner to say the secret word without using the word yourself.
 <br>
 &#34; - Okay, what if - donna, please, I already read the box.
 <br>
 - But, fez - I said box ! Okay, here are your secret words.
 <br>
 And good luck.
 <br>
 Okay, eric, staircase jedi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Hyde ? um fat.
 <br>
 Staircase, fat - escalator ! - Yes ! That is correct ! - What ? - What the hell ? Jackie, see me later for your prize.
 <br>
 Oh, we are so better than you.
 <br>
 Eric, how did you get &#34;jedi&#34; from &#34;staircase&#34; ? Uh, donna, the path to becoming a jedi has many steps.
 <br>
 You guys, I just took my baby girl to the playground, and she&#39;s just like her daddy.
 <br>
 She&#39;s way cuter than all the other babies and she eats bugs.
 <br>
 Wow, michael, you&#39;ve spent every weekend this month with betsy.
 <br>
 The only other thing you&#39;ve done this consistently was cheat on me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 He also glues himself to stuff with amazing regularity.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Look, brooke is totally starting to trust me now with betsy.
 <br>
 And she&#39;s letting me pick out betsy&#39;s godparents.
 <br>
 And she only has one rule it can&#39;t be fez.
 <br>
 Well, that is a smart rule.
 <br>
 Godparents ? Like we need any more responsibilities.
 <br>
 I know, such a burden.
 <br>
 Okay, so I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot, all right ? And it&#39;s a big deal.
 <br>
 So, eric, donna uh-oh please scooch over so I can ask hyde and jackie if they&#39;ll be betsy&#39;s godparents.
 <br>
 - What the hell ? - Hyde and jackie ? We win ! I was voted most popular, best legs and now godmother ? What can&#39;t I do ? And the password is a burn.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 19 &#34;Who&#39;s been sleeping here&#34; Oh, my god, this place is a mess ! Well, it&#39;s obvious.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve had a break-in.
 <br>
 And that pizza box is a clue.
 <br>
 Yep, they&#39;re italian.
 <br>
 Someone broke into my store.
 <br>
 What if they stole something ? Oh, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 My stash is safe.
 <br>
 Not entirely.
 <br>
 I got into it a little bit yesterday.
 <br>
 You guys, what are we gonna do ? What are we gonna do ? We don&#39;t have to do nothing.
 <br>
 Nothing big was taken.
 <br>
 Probably some kids having fun.
 <br>
 Fun ? Yeah, you know, fun that thing you&#39;ve never had.
 <br>
 I have plenty of fun, okay ? Michael, I&#39;m fun, right ? You&#39;re good-lookin&#39;.
 <br>
 Well, I think you would make a great godparent, eric.
 <br>
 You were so sweet with your pet fish.
 <br>
 Remember ? You&#39;d feed it potato chips and say, &#34;look, everybody, fish and chips.
 <br>
 &#34; All I remember is flushing it down the toilet when he killed it.
 <br>
 Who takes a fish out of the tank ? I just needed to hug something.
 <br>
 Why do think kelso didn&#39;t choose us ? Well, picking godparents can be very nerve-racking.
 <br>
 When laurie was born, we agonized over that decision for weeks.
 <br>
 And we chose well.
 <br>
 Mike and cookie were good people.
 <br>
 Wait, so who are my godparents ? Well, they&#39;re the the hoffenschloffers.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, the who ? The higgengloopers.
 <br>
 Okay, I think you just said the hoffenschnoppers, and then you said the hingengloobers, and I&#39;m not sure, but I don&#39;t think we know any hoffenschnoppers or hingengloobers.
 <br>
 Come on, what&#39;s supposed to happen to me if you guys die ? Maybe you&#39;ll finally move out and get a job.
 <br>
 Ugh.
 <br>
 You know, the responsibilities of being a godmother never ends.
 <br>
 You know, I spent all day buying matching outfits.
 <br>
 You know, life is so much more fulfilling now that I&#39;m shopping for two.
 <br>
 Okay, being a godmother isn&#39;t all about buying stuff.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah ? What&#39;s it about then ? Oh, you don&#39;t know either.
 <br>
 You guys, great news.
 <br>
 Brooke is gonna let me have betsy on the weekends.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 If betsy&#39;s coming here on weekends, we&#39;re gonna need matching godmother/goddaughter badminton skirts.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re just trying to make me mad.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what ? We don&#39;t have to stand here and take this.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Where are we going ? Um, I don&#39;t know, but we are just going to stand outside until they leave ! Well, I am proud of you, michael, getting so involved in your baby&#39;s life.
 <br>
 A child needs a strong, loving father.
 <br>
 Well, I am glad you feel that way.
 <br>
 So you won&#39;t mind when betsy visits if we stay up in laurie&#39;s room ? No.
 <br>
 No babies.
 <br>
 We get enough crying around here with eric.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Laurie&#39;s not using it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a great room with a very comfortable bed.
 <br>
 How the hell would you know that ? Uh, laurie always has such good posture.
 <br>
 That indicates a quality mattress.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong with your house, honey ? It&#39;s not safe.
 <br>
 If my brothers don&#39;t step on her, one of the dogs probably will.
 <br>
 You have dogs ? We don&#39;t know whose they are.
 <br>
 Hey, you&#39;re here early.
 <br>
 Not early enough.
 <br>
 We were broken into again.
 <br>
 Well, at least these kids leave more than they take.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not being robbed, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;re being cluttered.
 <br>
 I&#39;m calling the cops.
 <br>
 No, don&#39;t call the cops.
 <br>
 Why not ? Cause then they show up and they act all cop-py.
 <br>
 You know what I think ? I think you&#39;re the one coming in here at night.
 <br>
 Why would I come here when I have a house ? Well, a basement.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you tell me about the $10 missing from the register ? Are you accusing me of stealing ? Well, you don&#39;t want me to call the cops, and of all the people I know and I know 28 people you are by far the most likely to burgle.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know, I don&#39;t actually have to take this from you, angie.
 <br>
 I thought you didn&#39;t call the cops.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;T.
 <br>
 Guys, I don&#39;t know how to turn off the siren ! Hey, fez, let me ask you a question.
 <br>
 If you were choosing godparents, wouldn&#39;t you choose donna and me ? Well, in my country, we don&#39;t have godparents.
 <br>
 If something happens to your parents, tough crap.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a bum.
 <br>
 You americans and your safety nets.
 <br>
 Eric, are your folks around ? Why ? Do you wanna bestow some honor on them that we should rightly have ? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m trying to sneak this crib up into laurie&#39;s room, and I figure if I get it up there, there&#39;s no way they can get it down &#39;cause they&#39;re too old.
 <br>
 Kelso, I just can&#39;t believe you picked hyde over me.
 <br>
 I mean, what exactly was your criteria in choosing a godparent ? I mean, was it the ability to shoplift a keg ? My reasons are complicated.
 <br>
 Complicated or stupid ? There are elements of both.
 <br>
 Down.
 <br>
 But Down.
 <br>
 Well, we were broken into again last night, but you already know that since it was you.
 <br>
 Yeah, you busted me, angie, sneaking into my own store so I can eat pizza and listen to Neil Sedaka.
 <br>
 After the second break-in, I had michael install a hidden surveillance camera.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the same one he tried to use in my shower.
 <br>
 You spied on me ? Yep, and I thought we could watch the tape for the first time together.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m watching &#34;perry mason.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, guess what.
 <br>
 Perry mason wins.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not if he wins, it&#39;s how.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the magic, damn it.
 <br>
 oh, look, there&#39;s michael.
 <br>
 Even when he&#39;s not here, I have to see his ass.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve seen it almost as many times as I&#39;ve seen his face.
 <br>
 Oh, look, someone&#39;s coming in.
 <br>
 - Fez ? - Fez ? Hey, red.
 <br>
 Am I late for &#34;perry mason&#34; ? Ooh, who&#39;s that handsome uh-oh.
 <br>
 Fez, what are you doing there ? It was a secret.
 <br>
 I- I thought I was alone.
 <br>
 Okay, I know fez pretty well, and if he thought he was alone, we need to stop this tape right now.
 <br>
 fez, man, why were you staying at the record store ? Well, last week my bible-thumping host parents found out that I already graduated, so they kicked me out and took all my money as back rent.
 <br>
 And then they gave me a bible.
 <br>
 Well, I wish you had been reading that instead of the porno magazines I found in my office.
 <br>
 You know, angie, some things you could keep to yourself.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t understand why you didn&#39;t just ask us for help.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;re your friends.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my damn latin pride.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re latin.
 <br>
 No, just my pride is.
 <br>
 And I also have a swiss sense of frugality.
 <br>
 Steven, how could you not know your friend was a hobo ? Well, now that I think about it, some things do make more sense.
 <br>
 Man, where the hell are my keys ? Oh, here they are.
 <br>
 I just borrowed them.
 <br>
 But I didn&#39;t make a copy.
 <br>
 Why would you make a copy ? Why would I borrow them ? To make a copy.
 <br>
 Why would I make a copy ? Okay.
 <br>
 Did you just take a shower here ? No.
 <br>
 Why are you wearing a towel ? Because otherwise I&#39;d be naked.
 <br>
 Oh, there they are.
 <br>
 Hey, I was just happy he was wearing underwear again, all right ? I can&#39;t believe kelso didn&#39;t choose us.
 <br>
 What could be wrong with us ? Well, there&#39;s nothing wrong with you.
 <br>
 I love you just the way you are.
 <br>
 - Yeah, and I love you just the way you - although, well it might be that you don&#39;t have a job.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 here it comes.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;ve just been dying to get this off your chest, huh ? I don&#39;t have a job.
 <br>
 I play with toys.
 <br>
 Maybe you&#39;d like to talk about how I didn&#39;t show up for the wedding, too ? Oh, well, I don&#39;t need to talk about that because I relive it every morning when I wake up alone ! Oh, really ? Well, you used to be a redhead ! You dyed your hair.
 <br>
 God, it&#39;s like everything about you now is so fake ! Whoa ! You said you loved my hair.
 <br>
 I had to say that, donna, to keep you happy.
 <br>
 You trap people.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a trapper.
 <br>
 Nobody wants a trapper for a godmother.
 <br>
 Okay, wait a minute.
 <br>
 What are we doing ? You know what ? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s back up.
 <br>
 Why do we wanna be godparents so bad ? Well I want it for the joy of nurturing the spiritual growth of a child.
 <br>
 I want it for the prestige.
 <br>
 Yeah, me too.
 <br>
 I was just saying that.
 <br>
 Hello ! Why does everybody look so serious ? did the good year blimp crash ? Why ? No reason.
 <br>
 Some people shoot bottle rockets at it.
 <br>
 Fez has been living in the record store because his host parents threw him out.
 <br>
 What kind of parents would kick a child out ? And will they teach me how they did it ? You wanna be mean, you don&#39;t get a sandwich.
 <br>
 I think what they did to you is just awful.
 <br>
 He broke into my store.
 <br>
 Which you accused me of doing.
 <br>
 Accusing your own brother.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t get a sandwich either.
 <br>
 Anyway, fez, maybe you can stay in laurie&#39;s room.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I would rather fill that room with cement.
 <br>
 Yeah, respect a man&#39;s wishes.
 <br>
 Besides, that room&#39;s for me and betsy.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t get a sandwich.
 <br>
 Okay, I have an idea.
 <br>
 You and fez both need a place to live, right ? Yeah.
 <br>
 And living alone can get kind of lonely, can&#39;t it ? Sometimes I cry myself to sleep.
 <br>
 You see where I&#39;m going with this ? I do.
 <br>
 We each get our own apartment and we call each other on the phone a lot.
 <br>
 Or we could be roommates ! Roommates ? That is an awesome idea ! What were you thinking of, mrs.
 <br>
 Forman ? That you two should be roommates.
 <br>
 - Oh, thanks, but we already thought of that.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 All right, why did you choose them over us ? Is it &#39;cause I don&#39;t have a job ? Is it because I dyed my hair ? Look, I don&#39;t have a job because hyde turned me into a burnout.
 <br>
 And I dyed my hair because jackie destroyed my self-esteem.
 <br>
 Also, I rock as a blonde.
 <br>
 Are you beginning to see the influence that they have on people ? I&#39;m telling you, if you stick with them, your daughter&#39;s just gonna be a burnout, low self-esteem lump with no job.
 <br>
 All right, you&#39;re just trying to make us look bad.
 <br>
 Yeah, they&#39;re doing a decent job of it.
 <br>
 Kelso, why did you pick us ? Great.
 <br>
 Now I feel awkward.
 <br>
 Look, I picked them because I think they&#39;re gonna last longer than you.
 <br>
 What ? They just broke up and got back together.
 <br>
 Well, at least they&#39;re doing somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 What are you guys doin&#39; ? You don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Nobody knows ! They&#39;re just a safer bet right now.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 This is better than when he made us godparents.
 <br>
 We win everything ! Wow.
 <br>
 Well I don&#39;t really have a speech prepared, but I just wanna thank you guys for sucking.
 <br>
 Look, you guys, if I knock somebody else up, you&#39;re totally on the list.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe he doesn&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna last.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you don&#39;t think he&#39;s right, do you ? Well, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 We have kind of been drifting this last year.
 <br>
 No, no, not drifting.
 <br>
 You know, exploring.
 <br>
 Exploring is drifting, eric.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what ? This is all your fault.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always saying that something is something else.
 <br>
 God, it&#39;s like you&#39;re a big, blonde thesaurus.
 <br>
 Well, excuse me for knowing words, eric.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what ? This fight keeps going nowhere, and you wanna know why ? We are actually freaking out over something that kelso said.
 <br>
 Kelso, the guy who doesn&#39;t understand how hot dogs survive in the wild without eyes.
 <br>
 Okay, so you&#39;re not you&#39;re not worried, then ? No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Maybe a little bit, but I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna find a job.
 <br>
 Great, and I&#39;m gonna dye my hair back.
 <br>
 No, oh, no, no.
 <br>
 The blonde stays.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still using it.
 <br>
 All right, man, you accused me of stealing, so I&#39;ve thought up a very clever way of getting you back.
 <br>
 Today you wear the rainbow afro.
 <br>
 Actually, you know what ? I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 Watch this.
 <br>
 luck be a lady tonight luck be a lady tonight luck if you&#39;ve ever been a lady to begin I don&#39;t care about that.
 <br>
 Everybody knows I sing sinatra all the time.
 <br>
 Whoa, shoplifter ! Amateur.
 <br>
 here&#39;s two bedrooms with one and a half baths.
 <br>
 A half bath ? How does the water stay in ? Here&#39;s one with a dishwasher.
 <br>
 Ah, I don&#39;t want another foreigner living with us.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t need a dishwasher anyway.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s gonna do the dishes ? We&#39;ll just order in.
 <br>
 You never wanna take me anywhere.
 <br>
