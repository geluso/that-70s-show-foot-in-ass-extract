 Hey you guys, guess what part of my body I nicknamed Pink Floyd! Shut up! Jackie thought it was cute.
 <br>
 Well Jackie is not here anymore.
 <br>
 I was over at Jackie&#39;s this morning, she&#39;s so down, it&#39;s really depressing.
 <br>
 She&#39;s taking the brake-up pretty hard huh.
 <br>
 Cool! Shut up man, you cried like a baby.
 <br>
 Wow! I did not cry.
 <br>
 I had something in my eye.
 <br>
 For a week? I have allergies allright Is it so wrong to feel?! Anyway, Jackie is like in really bad shape.
 <br>
 So Kelso, now that you and Jackie are no longer an &#39;item&#39;, uhm, I can ask her out right? What? No! Since when do you like Jackie? Yeah Fez, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.
 <br>
 Yeah Fez man, that&#39;s a bad idea, Jackie&#39;s on the rebound right now.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just give her a break.
 <br>
 What?! Since when did YOU like Jackie? Allright does everybody here now like Jackie?! I still don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Thank you Eric.
 <br>
 Fez, Hyde was saying that Jackie is really vulnerable right now.
 <br>
 Yes! So I must move fast before she gets her self-esteem back! Yeah, can&#39;t blame her for being down, after all, I did dump her.
 <br>
 Actually, she dumped you.
 <br>
 Hey, I don&#39;t like to get into specifics.
 <br>
 Oh go turn around the mountain.
 <br>
 Nothing will stop me from asking Jackie out on a date.
 <br>
 Not even.
 <br>
 Ninja&#39;s! FEZ : Stand back! I want Jackie and no-one will stop ME! NINJA-MASTER: Hahahahaha! You cannot have Jackie! I will disable you with my cat-like swiftness! Oh Yeah?! NINJA-MASTER: Yeah! Oh Yeah?! NINJA-MASTER: Yeah! Oh! Fez? Go ahead Fez.
 <br>
 Ask Jackie out.
 <br>
 She won&#39;t go, cause you&#39;re foreign.
 <br>
 But go ahead and ask.
 <br>
 You&#39;re damn right I will! No Laurie, I&#39;m not giving you 15 dollars for new hot rollers! Straight hair is not the end of the world.
 <br>
 Actually Mom, Lauries world is a lot smaller and much more shallow then the average person&#39;s.
 <br>
 Come on Mom, curls are important for my self-esteem! Oh, you know what else might be good for your self-esteem? Not being the village whore.
 <br>
 Are you trying to start something with me little boy?! Because while you have to go to work,  all I have to do is sit around and think of ways to hurt you.
 <br>
 Oh I don&#39;t know, as village whore I think your day&#39;s all full-up! Shut up! Ha! I win! You&#39;re both wrong, so can it! You&#39;re dead! Oehh I&#39;m so scared! Kitty, remember that little French restaurant down town? Frenchies? The one and only! I made reservations for tonight, Forman party of two Well now this is so spontanious of you Red.
 <br>
 You haven&#39;t been reading my Cosmo have you? Come on Kitty, we&#39;ll get all dressed up, you can even wear my mother&#39;s necklace! Oh, the necklaceyayyy Come on Eric, we&#39;re gonna be late.
 <br>
 Bye Mom.
 <br>
 Bye honey! Oh this is awful.
 <br>
 Come on Mom, French food is not that bad.
 <br>
 Just order pommes-frites.
 <br>
 They&#39;re french fries you know.
 <br>
 No honey, the necklace.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have it anymore.
 <br>
 Really? What did you do with it? Nothing.
 <br>
 I said nothing.
 <br>
 Mom did you gamble the necklace away?! Okay stop it Laurie, I&#39;ll make you get a job.
 <br>
 Bye! FEZ (in his mind): Okay Fez, asking Jackie out is a big opportunity for you.
 <br>
 And if she says no, don&#39;t cry.
 <br>
 Just be witty and polite.
 <br>
 Stick to the script.
 <br>
 But most importantly speak slowly and e-nun-ci-ate.
 <br>
 Hello? Hello Jackie, how are you doing today? I&#39;m fine nice weather today huh.
 <br>
 Would you like to go out to dinner with me tonight? Okay Wait, who is this? It&#39;s me, Fez.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I just thought, since you and Kelso are no longer dating How is Michael doing? Uhh fine I guess.
 <br>
 Actually he seems dumber.
 <br>
 Well you know what, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Cause I&#39;m doing fine too.
 <br>
 Just fine.
 <br>
 Well, if you are fine, then I am dandy.
 <br>
 You and me: fine and dandy! Did you hang up? No.
 <br>
 Pick you up at eight? Fine.
 <br>
 Dandy! Okay, I&#39;m all ready so let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Wow, you look great! And you look sharp yourself, soooo let&#39;s go! Hey, weren&#39;t you going to wear my mother&#39;s necklace? Here it is.
 <br>
 I tuck it in so I won&#39;t lose it.
 <br>
 So, let&#39;s hit the road! Well you know, that didn&#39;t really look like the one that she gave you.
 <br>
 Sure it does, it looks just like it, cause it is it! Ahahahaha! Now look who is getting old, doesn&#39;t even remember what necklace his mother gave me! So let&#39;s move it out! Boy Laurie, you really like that hotdog! You didn&#39;t even chew it.
 <br>
 Oh hey Hyde, Father&#39;s Day is coming up, shouldn&#39;t you practice saying: Hi are you my Daddy? Oh, by the way Laurie, the surgeon-general called, he wants you to stop hoarding all the penicillin.
 <br>
 You know, when you&#39;re in prison, your bad table manners will probably just be a turn on for some guy named Tank.
 <br>
 Oh maybe when you&#39;re there for a conjugal visit, you can ask him to take it easy on me.
 <br>
 Oh yeah well NICE HAIR! Oh Laurie, are you all out of put-downs? Yeah, I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m having an off-day.
 <br>
 Even Eric burned me! Eric burned you?! You are totally lame.
 <br>
 I know, isn&#39;t that pathetic? Eric! What about me? Speaking of the spinly-armed devil What&#39;s so pathetic? Nothing.
 <br>
 At least nothing we can share with you Gomer.
 <br>
 Oh yeah well, NICE HAIR! What?! So Jackie, how is your very expensive dinner? It&#39;s great.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not replacing Michael with food! Are you gonna finish that? Oh that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You know this restaurant is very well know for their very expensive dinners.
 <br>
 But, for you, it Pass the butter! Ahhh the butter.
 <br>
 That reminds me of an amusing anecdote.
 <br>
 Well the other day, I was in the basement Was Michael there? Yeah.
 <br>
 Anyways He is SUCH a jerk.
 <br>
 Yes well anyways, back to my amusing anecdote.
 <br>
 Well the other day I was tying my shoe and Fez, I&#39;m so glad I came out with you tonight! Really? Hm I was STARVING! So what happened? Did you kiss her? Cause I&#39;ll kill you if you kissed her! Ah no I didn&#39;t wanna kiss her.
 <br>
 I wanted to give her a napkin! There was not a moment when she did not have a face full of food.
 <br>
 I was disgusted.
 <br>
 Really? Hey all&#39;s forgiven buddy! Okay fine Hyde.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t wanna tell me what Laurie said about me? I&#39;m fine with that.
 <br>

 <br>
 Aha.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 BecauseI mean that&#39;s what Laurie&#39;s know for.
 <br>
 NOT saying bitchy things.
 <br>

 <br>

 <br>
 What are you talking about loser? The camp story, dr.
 <br>
 PeePee, you&#39;re dead! What is going on? - Shh! Pretend it&#39;s TV.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Well I know some pretty horrible things about you too little lady.
 <br>
 Fella&#39;s, Laurie here waxes her lips, legs, eyebrows, toes and shoulderblades.
 <br>
 In the fifth grade Eric sent away for the Charles Atlas kid, cause a girl kicked sand in his face.
 <br>
 - You stuffed in highschool.
 <br>
 - So did you.
 <br>
 Last year Laurie used all of her birthday money to buy a back massager.
 <br>
 Which isn&#39;t fooling anyone by the way Wellthat&#39;s not as bad as when I walked in on you in bed with your Dorothy Hamill poster and you were all LAURIE WAS BORN WITH A TAIL! What?! YEAH.
 <br>
 LAURIE WAS BORN WITH A TAIL! I HATE YOU!!! It&#39;s true Okay Red, I&#39;m very sorry I pawned that necklace.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking about it and it&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just bygones be bygones.
 <br>
 What do you say pretty lady? What did you do? A few months ago, I pawned the pocketwatch your Dad gave me.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re even! Let&#39;s just get on with our lives.
 <br>
 Oh Red how could you? Well Kitty.
 <br>
 Who the hell needs a damn pocketwatch? &#34;What time is it? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll check my pocket&#34;.
 <br>
 See what I mean, it&#39;s just stupid.
 <br>
 Oh Red.
 <br>
 And I pawned the lawn-mower.
 <br>
 And Eric&#39;s old phonographplayer and snowblower.
 <br>
 We had a snowblowet?! Actually it was Bob&#39;s.
 <br>
 Well why did you get so mad at me? I got mad at myself.
 <br>
 Look, it&#39;s the man&#39;s job to support the family.
 <br>
 And if he can&#39;t do that, it&#39;s the man&#39;s job to pawn the things to feed the family he can&#39;t support! Okay.
 <br>
 Okay You know, Bob&#39;s been looking for that snowblower.
 <br>
 Yeah I know Kitty.
 <br>
 And believe you me, I&#39;m running out of stories.
 <br>
 So what you&#39;re saying is I slept with the devil? Exactly.
 <br>
 She told me it was a birthmark.
 <br>
 It IS a birthmark.
 <br>
 From where they cut off her tail at birth! Guys, I&#39;m actually starting to feel a little bad about this.
 <br>
 Yeah it is not right to reveal other people&#39;s secrets.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to have to agree with dr.
 <br>
 PeePee on this one.
 <br>
 Hello boys.
 <br>
 And how are you Michael? Well not so good, I just got some very disturbing news.
 <br>
 Well I hope you&#39;re very unhappy.
 <br>
 Fez, can I talk to you? Yes.
 <br>
 Fez I just wanna thank you for last night.
 <br>
 I know I wasn&#39;t my supercute self, and I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re a really good friend.
 <br>
 But Jackie, I was hoping that perhaps we could be more then friends? Well, hope springs eternal Fez How about you keep worshipping me from afar, and stay available.
 <br>
 Just in case.
 <br>
 You would do that for me? That&#39;s a sweet deal.
 <br>
 Should we kiss on it? Sure! Heh! Bye! Allright, that&#39;s IT! You&#39;re a dead man!
