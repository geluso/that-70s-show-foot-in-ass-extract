<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 You guys, Guess what all of us are doing on sunday afternoon.
 <br>
 Uh, I hope it&#39;s not going antiquing again.
 <br>
 I told you, donna.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just for girls.
 <br>
 Loved it.
 <br>
 Definitely in.
 <br>
 No, during my radio show We did a promotion where the tenth caller gets six tickets to the packers game.
 <br>
 And since I turned off all the outside phone lines after caller number nine, I was caller number ten.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going to the packers game ! Oh, awesome ! We got six tickets, and there&#39;s six of us ! No, wait.
 <br>
 One, two, three Fez, stop moving around.
 <br>
 You&#39;re confusing me.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re all gonna go to the game Together ? What, you won&#39;t go now &#39;cause you and hyde are broken up ? Well, I guess you&#39;d rather stay here and make sweet, short love to me.
 <br>
 No, no, no, I&#39;m fine with going, because I&#39;m the one who did the breaking up.
 <br>
 Steven is the one who&#39;s all devastated, So why don&#39;t you go make sweet, short love to him ? Um, I think something got messed up here.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m going, because I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Well, good, &#39;cause I&#39;m fine, too.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m superfine.
 <br>
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the one who&#39;s superfine here, all right ? I got the t-Shirt that says so.
 <br>
 Well, you also have a t-Shirt that says &#34;I&#39;m with stupid,&#34; and the arrow&#39;s pointing straight up.
 <br>
 Yeah, I hate that t-Shirt.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t even make any sense.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s above me ? Okay, uh, I hate to say it, you guys, but I think one of these tickets has to go to my dad.
 <br>
 So that means one of us has to sit this out.
 <br>
 Let me see.
 <br>
 Eeny, meeny, miney, kelso.
 <br>
 What ? How could you choose your dad over me ? Look, my dad is a huge packers fan, and he&#39;s never even been to a game.
 <br>
 Forman, it&#39;s not a problem.
 <br>
 We can all go.
 <br>
 Me, kelso and fez will do the old ticket stub switch.
 <br>
 That sounds dirty.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll do it anyway.
 <br>
 What exactly sounds dirty about &#34;ticket stub switch&#34; ? Oh, come on.
 <br>
 Stub, switch.
 <br>
 What are you, frigid ? Hey, dad, um, Say, could you give me a ride this sunday afternoon at, I don&#39;t know, 1:00 ? Eric, this is football season.
 <br>
 I know this doesn&#39;t mean much to you since there are no Flying men with capes involved, But I can&#39;t drive you anywhere on sunday until the spring.
 <br>
 And then your mother can do it.
 <br>
 Well, what if it was a ride to legendary lambeau field Where the packers are playing the bears and where you will be sitting next to me On the 50 yard line ? Eric What do you say, dad ? This&#39;ll be great, huh ? Honey, Are you crying ? No ! That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 14 &#34;Street Fighting Man&#34; Www.
 <br>
 Forom.
 <br>
 Com See this young man here ? That&#39;s my boy.
 <br>
 And he invited me to come and see this game.
 <br>
 I did that.
 <br>
 That was me.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t go in there.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got all that stuff.
 <br>
 Okay, listen, here&#39;s the plan.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve got two tickets, and there&#39;s three of us.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna go inside with one of you guys.
 <br>
 The guy who comes inside with me takes the two stubs, comes back outside, Brings inside the guy who&#39;s waiting outside.
 <br>
 You got it ? Why can&#39;t you wait outside ? Yeah, why can&#39;t you ? Because I have a ticket.
 <br>
 - Oh, that makes sense.
 <br>
 - Okay, yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, now to see who&#39;s coming in with me, instead of drawing straws, we&#39;ll draw tickets, okay ? So, kelso, you go first.
 <br>
 All right, I got one.
 <br>
 Damn ! Well, At leastit was fair.
 <br>
 Jackie, Are you sure you&#39;re okay being here with hyde ? Because I don&#39;t want you to be sad the whole night.
 <br>
 I have a feeling I&#39;m gonna miss a lot of this game if you&#39;re sad.
 <br>
 Donna, please, okay ? I&#39;m past the sad stage in the breakup.
 <br>
 Now I just want to make someone pay.
 <br>
 Like when your uncle diedand you were sad, so you hurt people by firing your maid ? Okay, donna, breaking up with steven was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
 <br>
 I gave him my heart, and he stomped on it.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t pretend everything&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Oh, and we didn&#39;t fire martina.
 <br>
 We called immigration and had them take care of it.
 <br>
 Thanks again for inviting me over for the game, kitty.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;ll be fun.
 <br>
 Red never lets me watch the game, because one time seven years ago The Packers won at the last minute while I was in the kitchen.
 <br>
 Now I have to sit in the kitchen every freakin&#39; sunday.
 <br>
 Okay, kitty, I need the packers to win by more than 7.
 <br>
 I got a hunsky riding on it.
 <br>
 We call them hungarians now, bob.
 <br>
 No, I bet $100.
 <br>
 Hey, you want in for $10 ? Yes, please.
 <br>
 Oh, I feel like a gangster&#39;s wife.
 <br>
 Ooh, how about I get you some pretzels ? I don&#39;t want to be any trouble.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s no trouble at all.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t let me finish.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to be any trouble, but I&#39;m gonna need something hot.
 <br>
 Maybe something with refried beans and a little cheese drizzled on it.
 <br>
 You put a little schnapps in the hot chocolate.
 <br>
 Yeah, more like I put a little hot chocolate in the schnapps.
 <br>
 You kids talking about booze ? Well, schnapp it over here.
 <br>
 Eric, I think your dad&#39;s been body-Snatched by a nice guy.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 When the packers got a first down, he actually hugged me.
 <br>
 It was, like, It was, like, warm, like I imagined it might be.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, Go bring in fez now.
 <br>
 You know the plan, right ? Take my stub and your stuband bring him in.
 <br>
 I got it, hyde.
 <br>
 Jeez, I&#39;m not 2, you know.
 <br>
 Uh, what do I do if I get lost ? Dude, you&#39;re a cop.
 <br>
 Yeah, what good is shooting somebody if I&#39;m lost ? Hyde, you&#39;re no help.
 <br>
 This is what it&#39;s all about, huh ? Spending time out here, us men.
 <br>
 Eric, you should be wearing a jersey.
 <br>
 Here, Go buy yourself one.
 <br>
 Whoa, Dad, thank you.
 <br>
 Eric, please, Only on first downs.
 <br>
 Wow, you actually got food for everybody ? How unnaturally thoughtful of you.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I have an ulterior motive.
 <br>
 See, I got steven caramel corn, but steven doesn&#39;t like caramel corn.
 <br>
 And he knows I know he doesn&#39;t like caramel corn, But I&#39;m gonna give it to him anyway.
 <br>
 - Wicked.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, boys, I got you all your favorite snacks.
 <br>
 Red, I got you a hot dog.
 <br>
 Donna, I got you three hot dogs.
 <br>
 And, Steven, I got you caramel corn.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like caramel corn.
 <br>
 Oh, my ! Well, if I was still your girlfriend and not just someone you couldn&#39;t see a future with, I might care.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not, so I don&#39;T.
 <br>
 Buh-Burn ! Hey, red.
 <br>
 Want to trade that hot dog for the caramel corn ? Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Damn ! I forgot about tradesies.
 <br>
 Now I could have sworn there was some refried beans right here behind my emergency bourbon.
 <br>
 Kitty, the game&#39;s on.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll dip the chips in crisco, whatever you got.
 <br>
 Aw, jeez ! I got you.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t falling, bob.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, then this is awkward.
 <br>
 You can let go now, bob.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s kelso ? Outside, of course.
 <br>
 Why ? Um, we don&#39;t have enough tickets.
 <br>
 How can you not get this ? Moron, how many ticket stubs do you have on you ? I have two, mine and yours, which, and try to keep up, Is why he&#39;s outside and we&#39;re inside.
 <br>
 Okay, good.
 <br>
 Now go take both ticket stubs and bring kelso in.
 <br>
 But then how would you get into the game ? I&#39;m already in the game ! Now go ! Okay, okay.
 <br>
 But you catch more flies with honey.
 <br>
 Jackie wants to know If you could take a picture of her having the best day of her life.
 <br>
 Is she insane ? Of course.
 <br>
 What are you, new here ? Okay, Steven, now that I&#39;m single, I am very, very attractive to other men.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t want to make you miserable or anything, but I think I&#39;m gonna start dating one of those big, stinky football fans.
 <br>
 I&#39;m single.
 <br>
 No, not you, cheesehead.
 <br>
 I mean Whoo, Cheesehead ! Uh, forget it.
 <br>
 Oh ! Why isn&#39;t this working ? What is wrong with me ? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have that normal jackie thing that you usually have.
 <br>
 You know, most of the time, when you put your mind to it, you can really hurt someone.
 <br>
 Okay, Do you remember Ashley Caldwell when she was talking about you behind your back ? And then you told all the other cheerleaders The reason that she couldn&#39;t do a split is because she had a wiener ? Well, Yeah, but, donna, That was easy.
 <br>
 I really wanted to hurt her.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t really want to hurt hyde ? Because you still love him ? Hey, some jerk&#39;s wearing a bears jersey ! Let&#39;s all get together and kick his ass ! Man, All these guys are pissed off at something, huh, dad ? Dad ? Who is this guy ? Bears, boo ! - Boo ! - Boo ! Eric, How the hell can you wear a bears jersey at a packer game ? Okay, maybe he doesn&#39;t understand why it&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Let me tell you in a way how you can understand.
 <br>
 The packers are like the jedi.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re wearing a go, darth vader jersey.
 <br>
 Uh, that&#39;s ridiculous.
 <br>
 The jedi don&#39;t play football.
 <br>
 They play manu-Ka.
 <br>
 Forman, This is worse than when you wore the air supply t-Shirt to the aerosmith concert.
 <br>
 For god sakes, will you just take the damn jersey off ? No.
 <br>
 You know what ? I like rooting for the underdog, okay ? I am the underdog in real life.
 <br>
 I like charlie brown.
 <br>
 I like the little engine that could.
 <br>
 I like the bears.
 <br>
 Excuse me, excuse me.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m back.
 <br>
 Uh, Where&#39;s fez ? Oh, I left him outside like we always do.
 <br>
 But I like how you made him come in and out just to make him think we weren&#39;t screwing with him.
 <br>
 Burn ! Kelso, we&#39;re not trying to burn fez.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just trying to all watch the game together.
 <br>
 Okay, this is kelso you&#39;re talking to here.
 <br>
 All right, who&#39;s getting burned ? Is it me ? Because if it is, I&#39;ll just let it happen.
 <br>
 No, no one&#39;s getting burned.
 <br>
 Now go out and get fez ! All right, fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get fez, and you can just surprise me.
 <br>
 Okay, steven, Certain people have implied that I might still have feelings for you, But I want you to know that I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 In fact, Now that I&#39;m single, I realize how big of a loser you are, and I&#39;m lucky to be rid of you.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna go and celebrate with a giant gold-And-Green cotton candy ! Man, what the hell is her problem ? She&#39;s ruining the football game.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go tell her where she can stick that cotton candy.
 <br>
 This is a very angry section we&#39;re in.
 <br>
 Very angry.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s not that bad.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;ve been wearing this jersey ten minutes, and Nothing that bad has happened.
 <br>
 Although I did just sit in nachos.
 <br>
 Good one, red ! All right, kitty, I think we need to talk about what happened in the kitchen.
 <br>
 Yeah, what the heck were you doing, bob ? I haven&#39;t been goosed like that since we won the war.
 <br>
 I thought you were falling.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t falling.
 <br>
 Why would you think I was falling ? You said, &#34;oh, jeez,&#34; and that&#39;s what I say when I&#39;m gonna fall.
 <br>
 &#34;Oh, jeez.
 <br>
 &#34; I just said that because I couldn&#39;t find your damn refried beans.
 <br>
 And both hands, bob ? I needed leverage.
 <br>
 Well, all I know is we have to keep this a secret.
 <br>
 If red finds out, he&#39;ll cut your hands off.
 <br>
 Fine, We won&#39;t say another word about it.
 <br>
 Although about it, may I say bravo.
 <br>
 Jane fonda.
 <br>
 Hey, - What happened with jackie ? - Huh ? Oh, nothing.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t find her.
 <br>
 You might want to go to look for her, though, By the snack bar.
 <br>
 Behind the pillar, concourse &#34;A.
 <br>
 &#34; Is that close to the ice cream guy ? I think so.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 Hyde, we need help.
 <br>
 This whole ticket thing is like calculus to us.
 <br>
 Okay, kelso is outside with two ticket stubs.
 <br>
 What ? How did you get in ? Oh, there&#39;s a hole in the fence.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Well, the bears have pretty much lost the game, so why don&#39;t you get lost ? Look, I think you&#39;ve made your point.
 <br>
 Yes, he&#39;s wearing a bears jersey, But he&#39;s my son.
 <br>
 Son or daughter ? All right, that&#39;s enough ! No, you know what ? You can say anything you want about me, okay ? It&#39;s not gonna bother me.
 <br>
 Yeah, stay out of this, baldy.
 <br>
 Okay, You can shut up about my dad.
 <br>
 Oh, well, who&#39;s gonna make me ? I am.
 <br>
 No, wait, I am.
 <br>
 Ooh ! Eric&#39;s in a fight ! No one&#39;s here ! No one&#39;s gonna believe me ! Why didn&#39;t I bring my camera ? Today was a miserable day.
 <br>
 Now I want to hire martina back just so I can fire her again.
 <br>
 You know what might make you feel better ? If you go wait in the car, while I go watch the rest of the game.
 <br>
 No, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You can come with me.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 I&#39;m vicious, all right ! I will tear that ass up ! Look at him go.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got the forman rage.
 <br>
 Get off of me ! Come on, Let&#39;s go tell your mom about our day.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Where&#39;d you learn all those fighting moves, by the way ? Spider-Man.
 <br>
 I had to ask.
 <br>
 Hey, donna, you know, fez and I are free if you want tickets to a movie.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 But I only have enough money for, like, two tickets.
 <br>
 No problem.
 <br>
 I know this thing we can do.
 <br>
 First, you take two tickets and go inside, And then we wait outside and sneak through the fence.
 <br>
 Sounds foolproof.
 <br>
 We are gonna burn fez so bad.
 <br>
 Well, this sucks, &#39;Cause before we&#39;d just kind of Hang out, you know ? Yeah, Well, that was before.
 <br>
 Obviously, hanging out doesn&#39;t work so well now.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Want me to give you a ride home ? No, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t mind.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;ll walk.
 <br>
 But thank you.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you sat on my couch with cheese on your pants ! Okay, listen, mom, Cheese on my pants is just who I am now.
 <br>
 No more spending time with your father.
 <br>
 He&#39;s turned you into an animal.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you got into a fight.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m thinking about becoming a boxer.
 <br>
 They may have to invent a whole new weight class.
 <br>
 Hey, What&#39;s lighter than a feather ? A packer win, and the boy defends the family name.
 <br>
 This is a great day for the formans.
 <br>
 I touched your wife&#39;s butt.
 <br>
 I made $10.
 <br>
