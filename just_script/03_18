<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So if&#34;x&#34; equals seven, then &#34;y&#34; equals- - Two? - Wrong.
 <br>
 Kelso? Uh &#34;L&#34;? Also wrong.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a pretty simple equation, guys.
 <br>
 Just think about it for a second.
 <br>
 You&#39;re so pretty.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t even need to know math.
 <br>
 That&#39;s so weird.
 <br>
 I was just thinking the same thing.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re so pretty you don&#39;t need to know nothin&#39;.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s good, &#39;cause I&#39;m stupid.
 <br>
 - [Blows Raspberry] Oh, real mature, guys.
 <br>
 [Panting] - Fez, what happened? - I was walking back from the pep rally flush with school spirit when-when-when some boys from Fort Anderson, they jumped me and they slapped me, and they beat me- And look at what they did to my pom-poms.
 <br>
 [Laughing] Hey, that&#39;s not funny, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really not.
 <br>
 They spray painted me on my ass.
 <br>
 [Both Laughing] I want revenge against those Fort Anderson Snapping Turtles.
 <br>
 Look, Fez, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go to the garage, and I&#39;ll get you some paint thinner.
 <br>
 - Ay, no.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m sorry, Fez.
 <br>
 It has to be done.
 <br>
 Yeah, and the three of us have to watch.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But this time, no smoking.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Now maybe we can get some work done.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Michael&#39;s so sweet.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s just so- - No! - Do you think that Michael and l- - Don&#39;t even say it, Jackie.
 <br>
 - I think maybe- - I&#39;ll kill myself, I swear to God.
 <br>
 He and I should get back together.
 <br>
 Jackie, do you remember how Kelso cheated and hurt you and lied to you? Listen to yourself, Donna.
 <br>
 &#34;Cheat-ed.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Hurt-ed.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Lie-duh.
 <br>
 &#34; It&#39;s all ancient history.
 <br>
 But when we look into each other&#39;s eyes I know we&#39;re both thinking about the same thing.
 <br>
 Your hair? No.
 <br>
 That we&#39;re meant to be together.
 <br>
 Look, I need to know that he&#39;s really changed.
 <br>
 I need to test him somehow.
 <br>
 - I agree.
 <br>
 - You do? Absolutely.
 <br>
 If you get back with Kelso, you better have him tested.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Okay.
 <br>
 I want to see if Michael is ready to be in a healthy, adult relationship so I&#39;ve come up with five psychological tests.
 <br>
 Damn, Jackie.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t even spell &#34;psychological.
 <br>
 &#34; Look, besides, he only has to get three out of five.
 <br>
 And the first test is on maturity.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re trying to get the paint off of Fez&#39;s butt, right? So I started to spray lighter fluid on it.
 <br>
 And Fez gets all mad, right? And then he started chasing me, but he had his Pants around his ankles.
 <br>
 So then he tripped and fell, and I think he hurt himself but I don&#39;t know, &#39;cause I was, like, out of there.
 <br>
 So what&#39;s going on with you guys? Donna and I were discussing our careers.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to high-end cosmetics and Donna thinks she&#39;ll make a great lumberjack.
 <br>
 Stop telling everybody that.
 <br>
 So what kind of career do you see yourself in? Okay, well, I was considering becoming a doctor.
 <br>
 Ooh.
 <br>
 A doctor? That&#39;s so mature.
 <br>
 Or a rodeo clown.
 <br>
 Rodeo clown? You want to be a rodeo clown.
 <br>
 Why? Rodeo clowns are the unsung heroes of the new West.
 <br>
 And you know I&#39;ve always enjoyed being inside of barrels.
 <br>
 Cheese puffs! Ow! Well, see, they&#39;re not for you.
 <br>
 They&#39;re for Bob and Midge&#39;s party.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Bob and Midge are having a party? Well, I can&#39;t go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m very, uh busy.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 Bob didn&#39;t invite you? No, but thanks for the heads-up.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be sure to avoid them.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Midge didn&#39;t invite me either.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m sure they&#39;re having a party.
 <br>
 I saw them bring a keg and a lot of chairs into the house.
 <br>
 Well, you don&#39;t know that they&#39;re having a party.
 <br>
 Bob&#39;s out of work.
 <br>
 The two of them might be starting some weirdo church.
 <br>
 You know, the kind of church where you, uh sit around on chairs and drink beer.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure Midge will be over any minute- the last minute, like always, to invite us.
 <br>
 I tell ya.
 <br>
 I like the sound of a beer church.
 <br>
 Hi, neighbor.
 <br>
 I have something I want to ask you.
 <br>
 - Oh, really? - Can I borrow your big punch bowl? A big punch bowl? Oh, my, what would that be for? Uh-oh.
 <br>
 I should have thought this through.
 <br>
 You know, forget about it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna get someone else to bring it.
 <br>
 [Gasps] And by &#34;someone else,&#34; I mean Bob.
 <br>
 Midge, l- I already made your cheese puffs.
 <br>
 Ooh, thanks.
 <br>
 [Sniffs] Mmm! Boy, all these cheese puffs are really gonna come in handy.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause Bob&#39;s so hungry.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not having a party.
 <br>
 Okay, this next test is about consideration.
 <br>
 I want to see if he&#39;ll choose my interests over his.
 <br>
 This is gonna be so funny.
 <br>
 - Grape.
 <br>
 - So Michael- There are two events occurring this weekend.
 <br>
 One that you might like and one that I would really, really, really really want to go to.
 <br>
 Now, should we go see the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders- [Scoffs] Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.
 <br>
 - Yes, or- - No.
 <br>
 Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.
 <br>
 - But Michael, I want- - No.
 <br>
 Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders! See? Funny.
 <br>
 Kelso, what are you doing? We&#39;re just tossing around this egg Jackie gave me to take care of.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you think it might break? Yeah, uh, well, we just thought we&#39;d have some fun with it before I threw it at somebody.
 <br>
 You are such a moron.
 <br>
 - You are so gonna failJackie&#39;s test.
 <br>
 - [Chuckles] Test? What test? I&#39;m not supposed to say anything, butJackie&#39;s testing you to see if you&#39;re ready to get back together.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Are you serious? - Do you think I have a chance? - Not a good one.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve already failed two tests and you&#39;re about to fail the third.
 <br>
 That egg is a test of your parenting ability.
 <br>
 So what you&#39;re saying is if I break that egg then I fail the test, and loseJackie the girl I love more than anything in the world? - Hyde, give me the egg.
 <br>
 - Okay, catch.
 <br>
 Whoops.
 <br>
 I mean- [Cackles] Okay, you guys let&#39;s do this for Fez.
 <br>
 Finally my butt cheeks will be avenged.
 <br>
 Voil√†.
 <br>
 Guys, I feel like we accomplished something today.
 <br>
 I feel like we made a difference.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m not done yet.
 <br>
 Taste my wrath, Snapping Turtles.
 <br>
 [Clattering] That was a close one.
 <br>
 [Loud Click] [Groans] Crap! The janitor locked us in.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 No good deed goes unpunished.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 How could this get any worse? [Panting] Okay, guys we have 20 seconds until the cherry bomb in the toilet goes off.
 <br>
 - Hey, guys.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s that? - Oh, it&#39;s just this little crib-like thing I made for Eggy.
 <br>
 - Eggy? - Yeah, I named him.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, this egg is, like, bringing out all the parental stuff in me.
 <br>
 Michael, what happened to the pencil mark I made on the bottom? Oh.
 <br>
 Must have come off when I was giving him his gentle bath.
 <br>
 Nice.
 <br>
 Michael, I knew you had this in you.
 <br>
 - You are gonna make a great dad one day.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Somebody needs a change.
 <br>
 [TV] Oh, I just can&#39;t believe Midge would do this after all the years we&#39;ve been friends.
 <br>
 She took the cheese puffs.
 <br>
 All the cheese puffs? What the hell? I wanted some of those.
 <br>
 Red, this isn&#39;t about the cheese puffs.
 <br>
 Well, maybe not for you.
 <br>
 They&#39;re so light and fluffy.
 <br>
 - This is all your fault.
 <br>
 - What? You&#39;re always mean to them.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;ve driven them away.
 <br>
 I hope you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 Actually, Kitty, I am happy.
 <br>
 Them not inviting us to the party is not the end of the world.
 <br>
 In fact, it&#39;s the start of a beautiful new world- a world where we don&#39;t get invited to the Pinciottis&#39;.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no talking to you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just sour.
 <br>
 You&#39;re an old, sour crab apple.
 <br>
 Why are you yelling at me? I&#39;m not the one that didn&#39;t invite you to a party.
 <br>
 If you&#39;ve got something to say, you say it to the Pinciottis.
 <br>
 Well, you talked me into it, Red Forman.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Look at us- locked in a locker room.
 <br>
 Oh, the irony is not lost on me.
 <br>
 - [Toilet Flushes] - Why do you mock us, Fate? Okay, you guys, we gotta think about a way to get out of here.
 <br>
 Okay, guys, I&#39;ve just gone through every escape-from-prison movie - I could think of, and I came up with something.
 <br>
 - What? Steve McQueen is a total bad-ass.
 <br>
 Okay, thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not helping.
 <br>
 If we don&#39;t get out of here, a bunch of jocks are gonna come in here and kick our asses.
 <br>
 Why did I put a cherry bomb in the toilet? It doesn&#39;t smell like cherries at all.
 <br>
 Come on, guys, think.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Gotta be something we can do.
 <br>
 I got it.
 <br>
 [Groans] [Chuckling] Much better.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Now instead of feeling scared and anxious I feel relaxed and relaxed.
 <br>
 I know we&#39;re probably gonna get beaten but it was worth it because we&#39;ve shown we have tremendous school spirit.
 <br>
 [Weeping] Go Vikings.
 <br>
 School spirit is for losers, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just, like, floating along on a conveyor belt of conformity.
 <br>
 Pep rallies, extracurricular activities washing your hair- It&#39;s all just a trap, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, Fez.
 <br>
 It&#39;s one thing to root for a football team but to confuse the Point Place Vikings with a sense of personal identity, that&#39;s just- relaxing.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all gonna die tomorrow.
 <br>
 Michael, I have some bad news.
 <br>
 - I just found out I have B.
 <br>
 H.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 - B.
 <br>
 H.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 ? Yeah.
 <br>
 Brittle Hair Disease.
 <br>
 I have to go to the hospital tomorrow and get all my hair shaved off.
 <br>
 - So you&#39;ll be- - Bald, Michael.
 <br>
 B-A-L-D, no hair, shiny head, bald.
 <br>
 And my hair won&#39;t ever grow back either.
 <br>
 Will you still love me when I&#39;m bald? You could wear a wig.
 <br>
 So, Michael, are you saying that you would not love me if I didn&#39;t have a luscious, full-bodied head of hair? Oh! No, Jackie.
 <br>
 I would love you even more.
 <br>
 You know, I would shave off my hair and paste it to your head.
 <br>
 Michael, that&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 Nice job.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 That was a test, right? &#39;Cause bald chicks are gross.
 <br>
 Look at that.
 <br>
 They closed the blinds, so we couldn&#39;t see the party.
 <br>
 - But I can hear them.
 <br>
 - [Music Playing, PeoPle Talking] I can hear you, Bob and Midge! I can hear your party! Ooh.
 <br>
 Kitty and Red.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve very busy in here.
 <br>
 Yes, we&#39;re very busy.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll talk tomorrow.
 <br>
 You&#39;re having a party, and you didn&#39;t invite us.
 <br>
 And I thought we were friends, and we&#39;re not.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll tell you something else.
 <br>
 You&#39;re naked.
 <br>
 You have no clothes on.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you have any clothes on? Well, we&#39;re having a nudist party with our fellow nudists.
 <br>
 We&#39;re, uh, nudists.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re not.
 <br>
 So, you didn&#39;t invite us.
 <br>
 So, thank you.
 <br>
 Come on, Red.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Kitty.
 <br>
 What are you saying? You really wanted to attend this party.
 <br>
 - Stop it, Red.
 <br>
 - No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 Now get in there and have yourself a good old naked time, huh? Who knows? They might play Twister.
 <br>
 Could be fun.
 <br>
 Okay, guys, they can&#39;t be mad at us now.
 <br>
 Yeah, Fez, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna help.
 <br>
 - [FootstePs] - All right, here they come.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, here&#39;s the plan.
 <br>
 Fez, you beg for mercy in broken English.
 <br>
 Hyde, you insist that this whole thing was a big setup.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll just curl up in the fetal position and think about pancakes.
 <br>
 - Got it.
 <br>
 - Got it.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 We&#39;re in the girls&#39; locker room.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 They&#39;re girls.
 <br>
 Phew! And I thought we were going to get beaten up for sure.
 <br>
 Hey, baby.
 <br>
 - Hi, Kelso.
 <br>
 - Hi, Tiffany.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad I ran into you.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you something.
 <br>
 - Yeah? What&#39;s that? - Will you take me back to your house and make out with me? Well, l- [Chuckles] I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m here to meetJackie, so- I promise she&#39;ll never find out.
 <br>
 It&#39;d be an afternoon of secret make-out fun.
 <br>
 You can drink grape juice from my belly button.
 <br>
 [Thinking] All right, this has got to be one ofJackie&#39;s tests.
 <br>
 I mean, Tiffany never comes on to me.
 <br>
 But what if it&#39;s not? I mean, let&#39;s face it, I look good today.
 <br>
 That new conditioner&#39;s really working out.
 <br>
 All right, but the real question is, should I risk it? And my body says yes, and my head says yes but my heart says no.
 <br>
 Aw, my stupid heart&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I mean, I appreciate the offer and all &#39;cause you&#39;re, like, really hot but the only girl I want to make out with is Jackie, so- Oh, Michael, you did it! You did it! You passed the last test! - Did you believe me, Michael? - Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 Oh, good, because I&#39;m in drama club, and I really want- Yeah, thank you, Tiffany, bye-bye.
 <br>
 [Squealing] Michael, now I know I can honestly trust you with all my heart.
 <br>
 Ooh! Um- Jackie Donna told me about the test.
 <br>
 So I knew what was going on, and I didn&#39;t say anything.
 <br>
 So maybe I don&#39;t deserve to be with you because that wasn&#39;t very honest of me.
 <br>
 But telling me that was.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 So you&#39;ll take me back? Yeah, Michael.
 <br>
 I love you, Jackie Burkhart.
 <br>
 I love you too, Michael Kelso.
 <br>
 What the hell happened to you guys? We got beaten up.
 <br>
 By men.
 <br>
 By big, strong men.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, as I was getting beaten I think I got to second base.
 <br>
 <br>
