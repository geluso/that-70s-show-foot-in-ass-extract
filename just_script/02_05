 A UNICEF contribution of thirteen cents will feed a child for a month.
 <br>
 Man, living in Africa must be great! Everythings so cheap.
 <br>
 If you ask me, man, UNICEFs a scam.
 <br>
 If we ask you, everythings a scam.
 <br>
 Everything is a scam.
 <br>
 Oh, lighten up.
 <br>
 Remember how much fun Halloween used to be? Making costumes, Trick-or-Treating What is Trick-or-Treating? Well, you put on a costume, you go door to door and say, trick-or-treat! And people give you candy.
 <br>
 Oh, you got to be kidding me! They just give you candy? The best part of Halloween is getting the crap scared out of you.
 <br>
 One year, I saw The Legend of Sleepy Hollow; I couldnt sleep for, like, a month! They give you candy? Just like that, no strings? Yes, Fez, get over it! Hey, you guys, you know what? My church is doing a haunted house.
 <br>
 I really dont think anyones gonna be scared by a bunch of Episcopalians.
 <br>
 Unless they have chainsaws! Lets go see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! Michael, I told you! I dont like Texans! I know! Uh, we can go to Old Maine.
 <br>
 Our old grammar school? Yeah, sure, you know, a dark, burnt out, boarded up school, very creepy? We could, you know, we could tell ghost stories.
 <br>
 Free candy? Even if youre not from this country? Yes! Hey, whyd they burn down the school, anyway? Oh, they said it was arson.
 <br>
 What? I was out of town that week.
 <br>
 Hm.
 <br>
 How convenient.
 <br>
 So youre telling me that if I showed up at someones house and say trick-or-treat, theyll give me a free piece of candy? YES! Oh, I dont believe you.
 <br>
 Trick-or-treat! An apple? Wheres my candy, you son of a bitch? Oh, shes very good.
 <br>
 I like her.
 <br>
 I hope she lives.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Oh well.
 <br>
 Why doesnt anyone just shoot him? I mean its Texas; everyone has a gun.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 This movies so lame.
 <br>
 Man, she deserved it.
 <br>
 She had sex.
 <br>
 And like all movie sluts before her, she must die.
 <br>
 No! She was about to take her shirt off! Trick-or-treat! Ok, here you go.
 <br>
 Mmm! Raisins! Eeew! No, raisins are good for you! Raisins are natures candy! And eggs are natures hand grenade.
 <br>
 Kitty, dont give em raisins! It just pisses em off! Jeez.
 <br>
 I hate Halloween! Well, you used to love Halloween! Remember that party we had when we first moved in here? Oh.
 <br>
 Mother Forman.
 <br>
 I see that you let yourself in again! Boy! Thats an awful lot of food! I cant imagine that you have that many friends, Kitty.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, speaking of friends, how are your four cats? Hey, Frank, uh, pull my finger! No way.
 <br>
 You were killing me in the car, man! Oh, good, youre home! Hey, Kitty! I like your outfit.
 <br>
 Youre a kitty! Yes, I am, Frank.
 <br>
 And what are you? Bum.
 <br>
 Im a bum! And I knew that! Red, honey, um I-I could, I could use some help here.
 <br>
 Uh, gee, Kitty, Id really like to help you out, but, uh, we gotta take these out to the garage and get plowed! He is such a good boy! Hello?Oh, hi, Dr.
 <br>
 Ferrell Hm.
 <br>
 Really? Oh my god! Oh! Thank you! Thank you, doctor!Yeah, thank you! Wrong number.
 <br>
 Oh, god.
 <br>
 No! Youre pregnant! Yes, I am.
 <br>
 Do you know who the father is? You know what I hear is nice? Florida! Look at this dump! No wonder Hyde tried to burn it down! You know, Fez, a man died in that fire.
 <br>
 A gym teacher.
 <br>
 CoachSmith.
 <br>
 Some say his specter still roams the halls to this day.
 <br>
 Take a laaaaap! Give me twenty, walk it oooooff! All right, guys, lets just cut it out, ok? Youre scaring the women! OUT OF MY WAY!! Kelso, it was the window! Yeah! I know that.
 <br>
 Out of my way? No, I didnt say that! Yes you did, right before you knocked her over.
 <br>
 No! I, I was protecting you! Protecting me? Yeah! I was trying to draw the ghost away from you.
 <br>
 Ghosts are attracted to movement, and thats a scientific fact! You know what, I dont care! You are an idiot and science is stupid! Donna, lets go.
 <br>
 Gee, wonder what were gonna talk about.
 <br>
 Youre dooooomed! God, I cant believe Michael pushed me out of the way like that! Me neither! I figured hed use you as a human shield! Donna, the most noble thing a man can do is lay down his life for the woman he loves.
 <br>
 Ideally, while shes still young and can remarry! Do you know who protected me there? Fez.
 <br>
 Well, he had to; hes Batman.
 <br>
 And the man said, &#34;Here&#39;s your daughter&#39;s sweater.
 <br>
 She left it in mycar, last night.
 <br>
 &#34; And the woman said, &#34;Why, that&#39;s impossible.
 <br>
 My daughter died ten years ago.
 <br>
 Wearing thatverysweater.
 <br>
 &#34; So? So, she was dead.
 <br>
 Andhe gave her a ride.
 <br>
 And she was dead! When I was six, the mayor of our town was hung from a tree.
 <br>
 Your story was not scary.
 <br>
 Not scary? The ghost of a dead girl gave him her sweater! What does a ghost need with a sweater, man? Maybe its to keep her guts from falling out.
 <br>
 You can tell it was not scary because Michael-ina here did not run screaming for the door! Hey.
 <br>
 Wheres it written that a guy has to protect his girl? Huh? And Ill have you now that the feminine form of my name is Michelle.
 <br>
 Look, Michelle.
 <br>
 I dont wanna come out in favor of saving Jackie, but thats the price you pay for docking your love boat in Jackie-vyarta.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 So, Icabod Crane lived in the village of Sleepy Hollow.
 <br>
 Wait, dont tell me.
 <br>
 He left his jacket somewhere! Ok, thats it.
 <br>
 Halloweens over.
 <br>
 Theres just, theres nothing that scares us anymore.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 We found something scary.
 <br>
 Yeah, it was in the principals office.
 <br>
 Oh my god, those look likelike They are.
 <br>
 Our permanent records.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Our permanent records! Oh, you know what? They probably left these here after the school burned down.
 <br>
 Hey! Pinciotti, Donna.
 <br>
 Well! Looks like someone we know had a real hard time keeping her clothes on in kindergarten! What? That was just a stupid phase.
 <br>
 Sure glad thats over.
 <br>
 I fear that despite Stevens high IQ, hes a born trouble maker and is destined to be the smartest man! In his cellblock! What? They couldnt have known that in second grade.
 <br>
 Steven willfully and maliciously destroyed Christine DelBuenos shoebox diorama of the four food groups.
 <br>
 Youre a monster.
 <br>
 A horrible, horrible monster.
 <br>
 Yeah, real funny, but I didnt do it.
 <br>
 You know whats really funny, Hyde? What, Forman? Heh heh.
 <br>
 I broke the diorama.
 <br>
 You? Hers was better than mine.
 <br>
 I had to smash it.
 <br>
 I left out dairy.
 <br>
 You know, thats when everybody turned against me.
 <br>
 They pegged me as a bad kid.
 <br>
 And once that happens, youre labeled forever.
 <br>
 You ruined my life, Forman! No, he didnt! Hyde, no offense, but with an alcoholic mom and an absent dad, you were bound to end up in jail sooner or later.
 <br>
 Hyde, I said no offense.
 <br>
 Yeah, right, lets see what that file says about you, Jackie.
 <br>
 Go ahead, I have a perfect record.
 <br>
 Would anybody like to know what Jackies middle name is? - Jackies middle name is - No! Oh, I hate you! Its Buela! Trick-or-treat! Oh, you look so cute in your little costumes! Damn, Frank, thats funny! Look, he lost his candy! Oh, that was not funny, Red.
 <br>
 Those were just little kids.
 <br>
 Well, thats what makes it funny! Well, think about it, honey, would it be funny if it were your own kids? But I dont have kids.
 <br>
 Well, you might! What are you saying? Im sayingIm pregnant! Oh, no! No! I mean, uhoh, crap.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 All right, nobody move! Somebody took my last box of Sugar Babies! Oh, no, wait! I was sitting on them! Gee, Fez.
 <br>
 You didnt give Forman a chance to pin it on me.
 <br>
 I didnt pin anything on you! No? Well, when Mrs.
 <br>
 Hodgekis was yelling at me in front of the whole class, you didnt exactly step up and take responsibility.
 <br>
 What were you thinking? Hm, I guess I was thinking, Im seven! Hey, hey, hey! Lets not fight, all right! Its Halloween, man! Its time for peace on earth and good will towards men! Lets read another file.
 <br>
 Yeah, cause thats working out great so far.
 <br>
 All right, fine! Ill read from my own, okay? Oh, okay.
 <br>
 Heres a secret you guys dont know about me cause it happened the year before I moved here.
 <br>
 When I was in first grade I used to wear this red cape to school and pretend I was Superman.
 <br>
 Mustve looked really stupid.
 <br>
 Wait, w-wait, first grade? Yeah.
 <br>
 No, no, no, when you moved here you and I were in first grade, thats how we met.
 <br>
 No, we didnt.
 <br>
 Man, you had to repeat first grade? Oh my god! Michael, say its not true! It was, it was cursive writing, all right? All thosestupidsquiggles and bumps! I wouldnt do it! You mean you couldnt do it.
 <br>
 No, I wouldnt do it, and thats why they held me back! Plus, I mightve killed the class bunny.
 <br>
 WHY?? Its ok, Kelso, let it out.
 <br>
 It sucked, you know.
 <br>
 Living this lie, pretending to be a year younger than I really am.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Youre eighteen? Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, thats why Ive always seemed more mature than you guys.
 <br>
 Are you telling me that all this time you couldve been buying us beer? You bastard! What-no! No, its not what you think! Youre dead to me.
 <br>
 But Eric ruined your life! And if I had a beer, I could be getting over it right now.
 <br>
 Beer! Beer! All right! All right! Everybody just leave him alone! Ok? Because he may be a liar, but at least hes not a back stabber like Eric.
 <br>
 Stay outta this, Buela.
 <br>
 Oh, dont call me that.
 <br>
 Oh, sorry! Buela.
 <br>
 Fine! You know what? Donna kissed Hyde last year.
 <br>
 What? Dont mess with me! Thatsthats a lie, Hyde kissed me.
 <br>
 Well, that is just so much better! How could, how could you do this, man? Guess Im just a born trouble maker.
 <br>
 Or maybe you turned me into one.
 <br>
 You are so dead, Buela! Hey, hey! Leave her alone, all right? Ok, yeah.
 <br>
 Jackie told me Fez was a better kisser than you, Kelso.
 <br>
 Ah! Were you ever gonna tell me about Hyde? Hurts when your friends stab you in the back, dont it? How would I know? I have no friends! Lets go, pal! STOP IT!! Cant you see what is happening? Those permanent records are tearing us apart.
 <br>
 Batmans right.
 <br>
 Look what weve become.
 <br>
 Were like animals.
 <br>
 Those filesare evil, man.
 <br>
 Weve gotta destroy them.
 <br>
 But how, Jackie? How? Oh my god, now my Sugar Babies really are gone! Kitty, Im really sorry about what I said.
 <br>
 You mean, oh no and crap? Right, thats it.
 <br>
 Im sorry, its just it was a big shock, you know? It was a really big shock for me, too and I said, Oh, good! And yay! No, II feel like that, too its just that Iwell, I I needed a minute for it to sink in.
 <br>
 But once it sunk in I realized I was really happy.
 <br>
 You really mean that? Of course I do.
 <br>
 Its gonna be great! I cant wait to be a father! Hey, Red! Great news! I found a way to drink beer faster! Come on! Go home, Frank.
 <br>
 Im busy! Ok! Yeah! Oh, wow.
 <br>
 I think youre maturing! Well, you know, the truth is, Franks getting on my nerves a little bit.
 <br>
 I mean, hes kindahes kinda, hes an ass.
 <br>
 And hes dumb.
 <br>
 Hes a dumbass! Hey.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 And then you gave birth to a beautiful daughter! And then Eric.
 <br>
 Who is just wonderful! And Ive grown up a lot since then! Oh, youre dead, kid! Michael, Im cold.
 <br>
 And this is stupid! We should just burn the files.
 <br>
 Jackie, theyve already been in a fire.
 <br>
 They cant be destroyed that way.
 <br>
 See you in Hell, permanent records.
 <br>
 And we have to swear well never speak of this ever again.
 <br>
 Except the part about Kelso buying us beer.
 <br>
 Yeah, naturally.
 <br>
 But otherwise its like this night never happened, ok? Ok.
 <br>
 Buela.
 <br>
