 <br>
 Why? Well because we need to get you some new shoes and some underwear.
 <br>

 <br>
 Yeah, and I can shop for my own underwear.
 <br>
 Oh no you cannot.
 <br>
 The last time you went you bought them too snug and I want grandchildren.
 <br>
 Yeah Well I have to Bye! You know, he used to love going shopping with me.
 <br>
 - Well Kitty hes sixteen - Seventeen.
 <br>
 Whatever, the point is when a boy hits that age, they dont wanna spend time with their mother.
 <br>
 And if they do, theyre weird! Its not a big deal.
 <br>
 Well it is a big deal to me Red Forman! It is a big deal! Okay Well I justI just wish sometimes he would want to spend time with me.
 <br>
 Well force him! It doenst matter what he wants, as long as were paying his way, we own him.
 <br>

 She sucked anyway, he can have her.
 <br>
 So Fez has a girlfriend? Still, what&#39;s that about Fez snagging a girl away from you, I never thought I&#39;d see the day.
 <br>
 So what&#39;s she like? It&#39;s just so twilightzone, I mean, to see Fez and Eric! Your mother asked you a question about the foreign kid.
 <br>
 What? Oh.
 <br>
 Never mind.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s it.
 <br>

Wait, wait, is this because I didn&#39;t want to go shopping with mom? You don&#39;t wanna go shopping with your mom?! Boy, I tell ya, if I had a mom, I would go shopping with her every single day, because no one loves you like your mom.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true Eric honey, we don&#39;t have to go shopping.
 <br>
 We could go see a movie.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be like a little date.
 <br>

 <br>
 PATTY: See you guys later! Okay, I don&#39;t like her.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t see why we have to be so nice to her.
 <br>
 Just because she is dating someone in our group.
 <br>
 Bites the big one doesn&#39;t it? Well I gotta go to work.
 <br>
 Am I right Donna? Don&#39;t you hate her? Not really Jackie, I kinda like her.
 <br>
 Hey what was that for?! That&#39;s for not writing me poems Michael! .
 <br>
 love you Jackie Leo, did you take your turn yet man? LEO: No man, I can&#39;t decide between &#39;college&#39; or &#39;career&#39;.
 <br>
 Well we can&#39;t start until you decide, so choose man, or I&#39;ll start working.
 <br>
 LEO: Hey, don&#39;t rush me man, this decision is gonna effect the rest of my life.
 <br>
 Go to college.
 <br>
 LEO: Okay.
 <br>
 But what if those frat-guys make fun of my hair? And beat me up like, like fascists and stuff.
 <br>
 Well then just start a career.
 <br>
 LEO: I can&#39;t let those frat-guys get away with it man.
 <br>
 Leo man, it&#39;s just a game.
 <br>
 LEO: Yeah, Life is hard.
 <br>
 Well now see, I didn&#39;t know that you liked green peppers.
 <br>
 When did that happen? August 5th, 1972.
 <br>
 I mean, I mean do you like green peppers? Why yes I do.
 <br>
 Very much.
 <br>
 So how is Donna? What?! We haven&#39;t done anything yet.
 <br>
 What? Relax! I&#39;m not here to grill you about your life Eric.
 <br>
 But you know, young adults do have a responsibility MOM! Please! Honey, you may not realise it right now, but I&#39;m actually doing you a giant favour by making you spend time with me.
 <br>
 Well, thank you.
 <br>
 No no no, I mean it.
 <br>
 Boys who reject their mothers grow up to have huge problems.
 <br>
 You will hate yourself.
 <br>
 And every relationship you have with a woman will just be a mess.
 <br>
 So, if you don&#39;t spend time with me now, you may never have sex.
 <br>
 Hahahahaha! I&#39;m teasing! A little.
 <br>
 Aha Hey, look how far Florence is from Venice Eric, honey, I just wanted to spend a little time alone with you outside of the house.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all.
 <br>
 Mom, that&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 And in fact, you know what, this is great.
 <br>
 BOY: Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyy!! Forman is out on a date! With his mom! Forman and his mom! Forman and his mom! My goodness, that Woody Allen is neurotic.
 <br>
 Well if I lived in New York I&#39;d be in therapy too.
 <br>
 The streets are filthy.
 <br>
 WOW, Diane Keaton is NOT wearing a bra.
 <br>
 Okay, don&#39;t let your mom see you look.
 <br>
 But I have to look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking and I don&#39;t care! Oh please.
 <br>
 He expects her to make love while he is wearing those black socks? Note to self, throw away all black socks.
 <br>
 Mah Jong? What the hell is Mah Jong? Mah Jong? What the hell is Mah Jong? Okay, an aspirine the size of a brick.
 <br>
 Now that is funny! Finally, a scene without sex! Oh greatdrugs.
 <br>
 Thank you Woody Allen.
 <br>
 Huh, I guess cocaine is expensive.
 <br>
 I&#39;m finally getting the feeling back in my jaw.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t get that, I mean he was just in bed with her and OHokay I see.
 <br>
 Oh God, I hope my mom doens&#39;t get that.
 <br>
 Oh I wonder if Eric gets that.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not gonna explain it to him.
 <br>
 So now, Patty is seeing Fez, and I just don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 She could have had me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a real catch man.
 <br>
 LEO: Allriiiiight! I had twins man! Oh look they&#39;re so beautiful! Congratulations.
 <br>
 LEO: Thanks man.
 <br>
 Hey I don&#39;t want to be competitive or anything man, but I&#39;ve got two kids and you don&#39;t have any.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just a lonely plummer dude.
 <br>
 It wouldn&#39;t be so bad, but it&#39;s Fez.
 <br>
 I taught him everything he knows.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all backwards man.
 <br>
 LEO: I guess you just can&#39;t dwell on things man.
 <br>
 Yeah, maybe I shoud just be happy for Fez, I mean, it&#39;s the first time in his whole life that he&#39;s ever had a girl you know.
 <br>
 LEO:Yeah you know, a while back I picked up a card you know, and I had a car accident.
 <br>
 And uh I was dwelling on that man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, what were you talking about? Maybe I should get back to work.
 <br>
 LEO: If you get back to work you&#39;re fired man Hey I got twins again man! Just admit it Donna! Patty is totally wrong for Fez.
 <br>
 Well Jackie, I have never seen you quite this transparant before.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? She is so awful Donna, let&#39;s hate her forever Donna! Let&#39;s shave her head and run around town Donna! Focus Donna! We&#39;re ragging up Patty, remember.
 <br>
 Jackie did you ever think that maybe you hate Patty because you like Fez? Oh you are in dangerous territory Pinciotti! No, I mean, it&#39;s true.
 <br>
 You hate seeing Fez drool over someone other then you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re crazy, I don&#39;t like Fez.
 <br>
 I think you do.
 <br>
 Oh shut up.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re blushing! Oww! Look, I&#39;ll admit that Fez would be okay for a quick fling if I was off on a vacation with my parents in Michigan or Cuba.
 <br>
 Where no-one would ever find out.
 <br>
 Ever, ever, ever!! Fez and Jackie sitting in a tree Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Fez? Donna, please, please shut up! Jackie you are so totally hot for him I can see it in your eyes.
 <br>
 Oh my God, OH MY GOD! I like Fez! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! Well boy, wasn&#39;t that fun, seeing all those sex-scenes with your mother.
 <br>
 Oh it was super sexy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad we could enjoy that together, really I am.
 <br>
 So I guess women in New York don&#39;t wear bras.
 <br>
 It&#39;s disgusting.
 <br>
 And we should move there immidiately.
 <br>
 Well I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;ve seen enough nipples for one day.
 <br>
 Mom! What? I don&#39;t ever want to hear you say nipples okay? Why not? Men have nipples.
 <br>
 - Your father has nipples! - NO! He does not! Okay.
 <br>
 So, what was your favourite part of the movie? I don&#39;t wanna tell you Oh come on! Okay, uhm, Diane Keaton&#39;s nipples! LEO: Okay, pay me.
 <br>
 Leo, I gotta help the customer man, I think he&#39;s gonna drive away.
 <br>
 LEO: Let him go, I don&#39;t need his stinkin&#39; photo money.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a doctor! Okay man, you know what, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 This game is over man.
 <br>
 This is not life! THIS is life LEO: Yeah but this life is so much better then this life! In the game, I&#39;ve got kids man.
 <br>
 In real life my kids split on me.
 <br>
 Really man? LEO: Yeah.
 <br>
 My parents split on me.
 <br>
 LEO: Oh wow, and now we&#39;ve found eachother.
 <br>
 Hey do you wanna be my father? Sure.
 <br>
 LEO: Okay, go ahead and spin &#39;dad&#39;! Maybe Mah Jong is a type of food.
 <br>
 Oh you know what, you could be right, it&#39;s probably Chinese noodles.
 <br>
 Yes! Hey, you wanna go see Close Encounter sometime? Yeah I&#39;d love to! Very cool.
 <br>
