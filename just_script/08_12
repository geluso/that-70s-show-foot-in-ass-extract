 Hey, Red, I&#39;ve got a question for you.
 <br>
 My wife says she doesn&#39;t want anything for Valentine&#39;s day.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m off the hook, right? Let me tell you a little story.
 <br>
 There was a woman, a newly-wed.
 <br>
 And she told her husband, rather then waste money on gifts, save for retirement.
 <br>
 And so he never bought her a gift.
 <br>
 Not for Christmas, birthdaysnever.
 <br>
 And 50 years later, she thanked him.
 <br>
 And you know who that woman was? No.
 <br>
 That woman  was the invisible dancing fairy of dumb-ass land! All women want gifts.
 <br>
 Well  what do you get a stripper anyway? Oh, how about a robe and a father who gave a damn? Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, life&#39;s a trade off.
 <br>
 If her father gave a damn, I wouldn&#39;t have this smile on my face.
 <br>
 Well Steven, it is important to keep romance alive once you&#39;re married.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I bought a present for Red and I&#39;m sure he has one for me.
 <br>
 Because he loves me and he knows what I&#39;m capable of.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right honey! Wait till you see what I got you! You romantic little devil you! Not hardly.
 <br>
 Follow me rookie.
 <br>
 Ever since I forgot Kitty&#39;s birthday that one year, I keep a stash of gifts down here.
 <br>
 That way, even if I forget, I remember.
 <br>
 Go ahead, I&#39;ll spot you one.
 <br>
 Oh hey, these woolen mittens&#39;d be perfect for Sam.
 <br>
 If only they were black, leather and a bra.
 <br>
 So what are you giving Kitty? Ahh this needlepoint.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll like it because it&#39;s fun and I&#39;ll like it because it&#39;ll keep her occupied for gigantic chunks of time.
 <br>
 Jackie dear, uhh, thank you for booking that lovely couple on our Fools For Love piece.
 <br>
 That guy was so cute.
 <br>
 You know he said no matter where he went.
 <br>
 He always heard his wife&#39;s voice saying &#34;I love you&#34;.
 <br>
 Well apparently another voice in his head told him to push her off a Ferris wheel.
 <br>
 Oh my God! Oh no no no no no, that&#39;s horrible! It&#39;s a tragedy! We don&#39;t have a couple for today&#39;s show.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve got three hours to find another one or you&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 Oh I&#39;m just kidding  No I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 Seriously Jackie, just kidding about firing you.
 <br>
 Christine St.
 <br>
 George&#39;s office.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t kidding.
 <br>
 Psssst Jackie! Come here! Ohhhh.
 <br>
 What do you want? I wanted to say: don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll all work out between you and Christine.
 <br>
 Well thanks.
 <br>
 Christine St.
 <br>
 George&#39;s office.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna get fired ! You&#39;re gonna get fired ! That &#39;70s Show Episode 8x12 - Killer Queen Transcript : twiztv Hey, Record Guy Mr.

 <br>
 It&#39;s Mrs.

 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Locks.
 <br>
 Uhm I was wondering if maybe you&#39;d like to I don&#39;t know, like  do something with me tonight for good old VD? Valentine&#39;s Day ! Not VD! I am clean as a whistle ! Man it&#39;s uh, it&#39;s really nice of you to ask but I&#39;ve already got plans with someone else.
 <br>
 Maybe a rain check.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 I love rain checks.
 <br>
 In fact, I love checking for rain.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go check for rain right now.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the office, here&#39;s no rain in there.
 <br>
 Clear out here too ! Oh.
 <br>
 Fez ! I have to find a happy couple for Christine to interview today or I&#39;m fired.
 <br>
 What about Red and Ms.
 <br>
 Kitty? Ugggg, I might as well book that painting of the old lady and the geezer with the pitchfork.
 <br>
 Ah I see where you&#39;re going with this Jackie, and don&#39;t worry, if it will save your job, I will pretend to be your boyfriend.
 <br>
 We should probably practice.
 <br>
 Oh ! Get off me! I was trying to help ! You were trying to cop a feel ! You didn&#39;t let me finish.
 <br>
 I was trying to help  myself to a handful of your boob.
 <br>
 But I would like to help.
 <br>
 No, Fez.
 <br>
 If Christine finds out we&#39;re faking it, I&#39;m fired.
 <br>
 I can see all that, baby.
 <br>
 Besides, interracial couples are sexy.
 <br>
 Because it&#39;s illegal.
 <br>
 Fez, it&#39;s not illegal for people of two different races to date.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not ? Freaking Hyde! Hey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Look, I just wanna make sure you didn&#39;t get the wrong idea when I asked you out, because I was asking you out as likeas friends.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad you consider me a friend, cause when I said I had plans earlier, actually I have a date.
 <br>
 And I was thinking maybe you could help me out and give me some advice.
 <br>
 You know, from the female perspective.
 <br>
 I&#39;d ask my cousin but she&#39;s kinda into me, it&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 Sure, yeah.
 <br>
 I mean what do you have planned? I was thinking  we start sweet, withstrawberry wine.
 <br>
 Then, we get a tad naughty with Dirty Word Mad Libs.
 <br>
 And then, hold on  what&#39;s this ? Tickets to the Monster Truck Mud Mayhem! Wow Randy, that sounds like a great idea.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re dating Granny from the Beverly Hill Billies.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 there is something I don&#39;t like about the usual roses, fancy dinner and theater tickets.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so  expensive.
 <br>
 Hey Leo, what is you idea of a romantic date? November 13th.
 <br>
 But this year is ruined, man.
 <br>
 I gotta go to the dentist.
 <br>
 Well I hope you two lovebirds are ready to tell us all about your relationship.
 <br>
 We sure are.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve been dating so long, we finish each other&#39;s Sentences.
 <br>
 Well, I was going to say sandwiches but whatever.
 <br>
 Okay, here we go.
 <br>
 What&#39;s Up, Wisconsin? It&#39;s time for our annual &#34;Fools For Love&#34; segment and with me today is my assistant, Jackie Burkhart and her boyfriend, Fez How do you pronounce your last name? Oh, the first five Ks are silent.
 <br>
 See how they look at each other! Hm.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just the way Sonny used to look at me while Cher was in make-up.
 <br>
 Sotell us how you two met.
 <br>
 Well uhm I&#39;ll take this one baby.
 <br>
 It was the third grade.
 <br>
 Jackie came to school with pink-eye.
 <br>
 All the kids teased her, so  I rubbed her eye and infected myself.
 <br>
 So she wouldn&#39;t be alone.
 <br>
 I guess you can say it was love at first sight ! Pink sight that is.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m sure my viewers are dying to know the secret of your happiness.
 <br>
 It&#39;s very simple.
 <br>
 We make out every chance we get.
 <br>
 Kiss me baby ! Nooooo! No no baby baby, I  I have a cold sore.
 <br>
 Well baby, that wouldn&#39;t be the first time I got a disease from you baby.
 <br>
 No no baby, I justI ate some garlic bread.
 <br>
 Oh baby that&#39;s perfect! I just ate spaghetti, baby! Oh.
 <br>
 Baby.
 <br>
 Baby.
 <br>
 Baby.
 <br>
 Baby.
 <br>
 Baby.
 <br>
 BABY ! Come on Jackie.
 <br>
 Give your man a Valentine&#39;s Day kiss ! Call the fire department ! You can&#39;t fake passion like that.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 Well, that was terrific.
 <br>
 Jackie, thank you, you acted yourself darling.
 <br>
 And Fez  as usual I didn&#39;t understand a word you said.
 <br>
 Fez ! We did it ! Oh you totally saved my job.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 And you totally were not kidding when you said you ate garlic bread.
 <br>
 There&#39;s my Valentine.
 <br>
 See, now.
 <br>
 The card is a heart, actually it&#39;s your heart, and it&#39;s saying: &#34;Hi Red, remember when I attacked you?&#34; It&#39;s a reminder to cut back on fatty fried foods.
 <br>
 Well that&#39;s real cute.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you what, you close your eyes and start counting and I&#39;ll be right back with your gift ! What the hell ! Oh Nooo ! Mrs.
 <br>
 St.
 <br>
 George, are you okay? Yes, it&#39;s  this happens to me every Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 I see a couple in love and it reminds me that I am missing the one thing that every woman needs to feel good about herself.
 <br>
 A friend that is fatter then you? Love ! I sacrificed love for my career and sometimes I think I maybe did the wrong thing.
 <br>
 Have a drink with me.
 <br>
 Really? Tell me all about yourself.
 <br>
 Who you are, what makes you tick.
 <br>
 Well, uhm.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go back to me.
 <br>
 I was born in a small hamlet, just outside a little place I like to call New York   And so I returned safely to base-camp.
 <br>
 That half-frozen sherpa on my back.
 <br>
 There is a famous Tibetan folksong about it.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You&#39;re incredible.
 <br>
 So are you.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s to you dear.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 To you Ms.
 <br>
 St.
 <br>
 George.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s what I meant.
 <br>
 Why on God&#39;s green earth would I drink to you? You&#39;re cut off.
 <br>
 So do I look okay? Just wanna make sure my outfit doesn&#39;t send the wrong message to my date.
 <br>
 Okay, what message are you trying to send? I&#39;d like it to say : Hi, my name is Randy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a fun-loving, yet slightly naughty guy.
 <br>
 The little boy in me is insecure, but the man in me is cocky, giving me a playfully heady mix of humility and aloofness.
 <br>
 I like you, let&#39;s party! I think you are asking a little too much from a jacket, but  go have fun.
 <br>
 Okay Donna, you&#39;re Valentine&#39;s here! I thought we&#39;d start with some Hangman, then move into something that really gets the pulse racing like  Yahtzee.
 <br>
 Alright.
 <br>
 Just so long as when you get Yhatzee you yell Poopsie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not a promise I can make.
 <br>
 Oeh, pizza ! Oh.
 <br>
 You&#39;re back.
 <br>
 Hope your car is not blocking the driveway, we&#39;re expecting a pizza.
 <br>
 Donna, would you go out with me on a big Valentine&#39;s Day date? What about the other girl? There is no other girl.
 <br>
 I just think you&#39;re hot and I want to go out with you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a father and I&#39;m standing right here! Here Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Pizza&#39;s on me.
 <br>
 Have her home by sunrise.
 <br>
 Hey Kitty.
 <br>
 Hi Red.
 <br>
 Sorry I didn&#39;t get around to making dinner, but  I was too busy counting to 956.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s gonna be worth it, cause I found your gift.
 <br>
 Look at that.
 <br>
 Pack of gum.
 <br>
 Tire gauge.
 <br>
 Actually the gum was for me.
 <br>
 Red ! Kitty, you always said it&#39;s the thought that counts.
 <br>
 Oh I said that to Eric when he was five and he gave me that stupid macaroni-frame.
 <br>
 You ! What did you do ? I&#39;m sorry Red.
 <br>
 I was down there picking out a gift for Sam and she caught me and assumed everything was for her.
 <br>
 And she started kissing me everywhere and I just handed everything over to her.
 <br>
 That&#39;s her power man.
 <br>
 Good God Steven, the whole stash ? Look, I know I owe you an apology but can it wait ? Cause Sam just send me up here to get some whipped cream.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Sorry ! Okay.
 <br>
 What were you two talking about? Well Kitty  I had a stash of gifts down there for every occasion.
 <br>
 That way, if I forgot to buy you something, I&#39;d still be covered.
 <br>
 You buy my gifts in bulk ?! Nooooo  it&#39;s  more of a .
 <br>
 vast inventory of love.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re about to get a vast inventory of my foot in your ass ! Yeah ! I can do that too ! Wow.
 <br>
 So  this was for me all along? Yeah.
 <br>
 For one day I wanted to transform this crappy little record store into a crappy little bistro.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 So, when I asked you out, why did you pretend to have another date ? Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve wanted to ask you out for a long time.
 <br>
 And then you kinda beat me to it and I&#39;m kinda of a traditional guy.
 <br>
 I like to make the first move.
 <br>
 But  if you want to make the second move, well, you&#39;re in luck.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not wearing a bra ! That&#39;s good to know.
 <br>
 Hey ! I just had the best meal ! Somebody left two whole steak-dinners in there ! Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m off to the Monster Truck Show.
 <br>
 Would you just listen?! Oh Red, I&#39;d love to talk to you but I have to check the pressure in my tires! Hey Red.
 <br>
 Kitty told Sam the presents weren&#39;t for her.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m kinda in trouble.
 <br>
 So, I got us each a bouquet of flowers for our ladies.
 <br>
 Kitty! I got you roses! See how it feels, dumb-ass? Jackie.
 <br>
 Come in.
 <br>
 Please.
 <br>
 I just wanna thank you for yesterday.
 <br>
 I feel we really bonded.
 <br>
 As much as a star can bond with a commoner.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m  I&#39;m really glad that we talked.
 <br>
 You know, I got to see there&#39;s a real person in there.
 <br>
 Someone with hopes and fears and emotions.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m only human.
 <br>
 And you snuck a rare peak behind my iron curtain didn&#39;t you? I know.
 <br>
 You know I really feel like I got to know you better.
 <br>
 Yes you did.
 <br>
 And so you&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 Wait, what? I cannot have an employee know so much about me.
 <br>
 And since you&#39;re TV career is finished, may I suggest bartending? You pour a mean Scotch, lady.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 no no no no.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t fair.
 <br>
 I work my butt off for you.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Out you go.
 <br>
 Go on.
 <br>
 Okay alright you know what? Nobody here likes you.
 <br>
 They only pretend to like you because you&#39;re famous.
 <br>
 And I pretend to like them because they bring me lunch.
 <br>
 Oh God.
 <br>
 Ohhh.
 <br>
 You are a crazy bitter lady with a hole where your heart should be! Now is that supposed to hurt me? I have a mug that says that.
 <br>
 Those shoes are so last season! Rot in hell you worthless maggot! Well I guess that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Awww, I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t cry.
 <br>
 Wadda ya know, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Okay look.
 <br>
 Christine is obviously looking for a new assistant, so I put in a good word for you.
 <br>
 Really? Even though I was so mean to you? Wow thanks.
 <br>
 What&#39;s Up Wisconsin? I licked your phone! I licked your phone!
 <br>
