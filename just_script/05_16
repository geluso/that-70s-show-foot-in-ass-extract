<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Forman, why&#39;d you have to tell Red you got engaged? Look at him- yelling and waving.
 <br>
 Oh! A little spit just landed on Bob.
 <br>
 Bob&#39;s so scared, he&#39;s not even wiping it off.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 This time Red is really gonna kill me.
 <br>
 My only hope is that he actually sticks his foot so far up my ass he can&#39;t pull it out, and I get to take him straight to hell with me.
 <br>
 Why did you tell him? We had it all planned.
 <br>
 We were gonna give them wine, get &#39;em all loose and juiced.
 <br>
 But you spilled the beans.
 <br>
 Good, because wine and beans is not a good combo.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Toot-toot, if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 Sorry I&#39;m late! I was cutting through backyards on the way over here and the Hendersons got a new jungle gym! Whoa.
 <br>
 They&#39;re still yelling? Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m trying to read Red&#39;s lips, but I can&#39;t make it out.
 <br>
 He keeps calling me a &#34;stupid duck.
 <br>
 &#34; - [Snaps Fingers] - Ah! Hey, I&#39;ll go spy on them.
 <br>
 I just gotta run home real quick and change into my ninja outfit.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think this situation calls for camouflage, Kelso.
 <br>
 Well, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not fun to wear, Eric! But they&#39;re just too young to get married.
 <br>
 How are they gonna live on their own? Eric jumps a foot every time the furnace kicks on.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not mature enough to get married.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still cutting the crusts off his sandwiches.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s really more for me.
 <br>
 He&#39;s my baby.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t mind me.
 <br>
 Feel free to keep talking.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just getting a soda.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not spying.
 <br>
 Hey, l-I don&#39;t like this engagement either but it&#39;s not like they can break it off.
 <br>
 Why the hell not? Well, it wouldn&#39;t be very romantic, for one.
 <br>
 Oh, forget about it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take care of this myself! No, no.
 <br>
 Red, if you go out there and yell, you&#39;re just gonna drive him away.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Kitty, but yelling is the only part of being a father that I enjoy.
 <br>
 Red- Red, I am putting my foot down.
 <br>
 I forbid it.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Wow! Red, I forbid you to- Shut up, Bob.
 <br>
 Burn! [Laughs] - Get out! - Yeah.
 <br>
 Well? What were they saying? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Well, I was so busy acting like I wasn&#39;t listening, I forgot to listen.
 <br>
 - [Groans] - Man! I betcha he&#39;s trying to think of a punishment.
 <br>
 He already took away the Vista Cruiser and- and fined me.
 <br>
 What&#39;s next? Is he gonna cut off my pinkie? Ay! What&#39;s the point of getting married, Red&#39;s gonna cut that off? ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] Nina, you have such beautiful fingers.
 <br>
 So long and elegant- like spider legs.
 <br>
 - We can&#39;t do this here.
 <br>
 - [Phones Ringing] We can go to the backseat of the student-driver car.
 <br>
 But I have to warn you- I have a hard time keeping my hands at 10:00 and 2:00.
 <br>
 Fez, this tension between us is causing problems.
 <br>
 And here at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 , I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s easier to solve problems when they&#39;re posed in a multiple-choice format.
 <br>
 So, &#34;A,&#34; we can further explore our relationship and hope that relieves the tension or, &#34;B,&#34; I can fire you.
 <br>
 Is this some kind of trick? It&#39;s not a trick.
 <br>
 Hmm, so it is a trick.
 <br>
 I choose &#34;B.
 <br>
 &#34; No, you choose &#34;A&#34;! [Ringing Continues] Okay, I&#39;ll take &#34;A.
 <br>
 &#34; But I think you should throw a little &#34;T&#34; in there too.
 <br>
 - Dinner&#39;s ready, Eric.
 <br>
 - You know what? Um, Dad&#39;s in there, so I&#39;ll just, you know, forage for berries.
 <br>
 Look, I am not happy about this situation either but I am in there making the best of it not out here diddling a basketball.
 <br>
 Mom, if I was out here diddling a basketball this would be a very different conversation.
 <br>
 Get in there.
 <br>
 [Door Slams] Well, look who I found.
 <br>
 Our son- who we love very much.
 <br>
 - Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 - Pass the peas, Steven.
 <br>
 Red, your son spoke to you.
 <br>
 I heard him.
 <br>
 But you asked me not to yell at him, and I agreed.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m just taking your idea and refining it.
 <br>
 Oh, so you&#39;re giving me the silent treatment? So, Steven, how was school today? Um, well, in health class today, we learned that an early engagement&#39;s often a sign of heavy drug use.
 <br>
 Hyde! Red, you&#39;re being a big baby.
 <br>
 No, Mom, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Actually, it&#39;s a pleasant surprise but let&#39;s see how serious he is about it.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad, you know who&#39;s got the right idea? - Russia.
 <br>
 - [Utensil Clatters] I haven&#39;t felt this kind of tension in years.
 <br>
 Reminds me of home.
 <br>
 Except everyone&#39;s wearing a shirt.
 <br>
 [Operatic Birthday Greeting] Oh! Is this for me? - [Voice Cracks] Yeah.
 <br>
 - Jackie, it&#39;s your birthday? Ah, I figured you knew.
 <br>
 A good boyfriend would have, but whatever.
 <br>
 Hey, why didn&#39;t you tell me, man? I would have gotten you something.
 <br>
 Well, I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal about it.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I&#39;m trying not to care so much about gifts and material things, and- [Gasps] Oh, it&#39;s not working, because this is beautiful! Oh! I&#39;m gonna go try it on! Thank you! Mmm.
 <br>
 - [Sighs] - [Door Closes] Kelso, what are you doing, man? You trying to make me look bad? No, I&#39;m not doing anything.
 <br>
 Well, whatever you are doing you shouldn&#39;t go up against me, &#39;cause you&#39;re not gonna win.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not doing anything, and I am going to win.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna lose.
 <br>
 How can I lose if I&#39;m not doing anything? How can you win if you&#39;re not doing anything? Well, if I win, I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m doing something.
 <br>
 Nina, I think people at work are starting to notice there&#39;s something between us.
 <br>
 Well, it didn&#39;t help when you stood up at the staff meeting and said, &#34;I want to do it with Nina.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, they asked if there was any unfinished business.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;ve figured out a way to get rid of all this tension.
 <br>
 You need to spend the night with me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m all yours, boss lady.
 <br>
 But you have to tell me where to stop now because I have been burned in the past.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want you to stop anywhere.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Oh! [Singsongy] I&#39;m going to do it! I&#39;m going to do it! Fez! Sorry.
 <br>
 I wrote this song about three years ago, and I finally get to use it.
 <br>
 That sweater wasn&#39;t on sale or anything.
 <br>
 Paid full price.
 <br>
 Pretty sweet, huh? Yes.
 <br>
 But it gets less sweet the more you talk about it.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Twenty-seven dollars! [Chuckles] Hey.
 <br>
 How was work with Red? It was terrible.
 <br>
 I thought Red not talking to me would be cool.
 <br>
 But today, instead of telling me to sweep the back room he just threw a broom at me.
 <br>
 Well, what about if I talked to him? We&#39;ve always gotten along.
 <br>
 Maybe I can get through to him.
 <br>
 Donna, I&#39;m not gonna make you fight my battles for me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna ask the woman that I love to do what I should do.
 <br>
 But Red&#39;ll be home at about 5:30, so try to catch him before dinner, okay? Attention, everyone.
 <br>
 My friend Fez has some wonderful news.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Knock, knock.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s there? I did it! All right, Fez! Nah! Wait! Wait.
 <br>
 I want to hear this.
 <br>
 &#34;I did it&#34; who? Wait.
 <br>
 Fez, I can&#39;t believe you finally lost your virginity! Wait, wait.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t like the time you bought a hamster named it &#34;Virginity,&#34; and then lost it, is it? No.
 <br>
 This is the real thing.
 <br>
 You know, I had a hamster once.
 <br>
 I tied him up to a helium balloon with a note.
 <br>
 Made it all the way to Minnesota.
 <br>
 - Alive? - No, I&#39;m gonna send a dead hamster up in a balloon.
 <br>
 - So? Come on.
 <br>
 Tell us all about it.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, It was incredible.
 <br>
 Nina and I started out kissing in the living room.
 <br>
 Then we moved into the bedroom, where we undressed.
 <br>
 And, uh, well, then- then we did it.
 <br>
 What- Details, Fez.
 <br>
 We need details! Well, our faces didn&#39;t line up right so I kept bumping my chin on her nose.
 <br>
 And then there were some sounds.
 <br>
 What kind of sounds? I will say this.
 <br>
 It was not applause.
 <br>
 There was no romantic music like in the movies, so I had to hum.
 <br>
 And then Nina told me to stop humming.
 <br>
 And, uh, then I started again without realizing it.
 <br>
 And then she got mad.
 <br>
 And then I think she got sad.
 <br>
 Oh, well, don&#39;t worry, Fez.
 <br>
 She probably just felt bad she was doing it with a foreigner.
 <br>
 And then afterwards, I went into the bathroom, and, uh- and cried a little.
 <br>
 And then I snuck out the back door.
 <br>
 Poor Fez.
 <br>
 Well, you know, at least it couldn&#39;t have been any worse.
 <br>
 I left my underwear in her bathroom.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, you remember what it felt like when you fell in love with Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, don&#39;t you? Nope.
 <br>
 One day I just woke up, and my life was over.
 <br>
 Next question.
 <br>
 Well, I think, um- I think what Mr.
 <br>
 Forman is trying to say is that we worry you&#39;re too young to get married.
 <br>
 Do you even know how to bake a casserole? I don&#39;t think you do.
 <br>
 Look, I believe there&#39;s one person out there for everyone.
 <br>
 And you guys are that person for each other, and Eric is that person for me.
 <br>
 And if you could just open your hearts you&#39;d see that we should be together forever.
 <br>
 Because we&#39;re in love, and we make each other really happy.
 <br>
 Donna, that is so romantic.
 <br>
 I still think you&#39;re too young.
 <br>
 But if it has to be someone, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 I always wanted a daughter.
 <br>
 You already have a daughter.
 <br>
 A better daughter.
 <br>
 You know what, Donna? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 You are Eric are perfect for each other.
 <br>
 - Really? - Yes! You&#39;re as big a dumb-ass as he is! [Laughing] Welcome to the family.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so nervous about working with Nina today.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like, now that we did it, I never want to see her face again.
 <br>
 Yeah, you did it, all right.
 <br>
 Hey, hey! Look who&#39;s wearing a $27 sweater! Jackie, you can&#39;t keep that sweater.
 <br>
 - Why not? - Because it&#39;s from Kelso.
 <br>
 Yeah, but it&#39;s so pink and fuzzy that it just makes up for it.
 <br>
 Kelso, she&#39;s someone else&#39;s girlfriend.
 <br>
 What are you doing? I&#39;m not doing anything.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s working.
 <br>
 Just take it off.
 <br>
 Leave it on.
 <br>
 Take it off.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see some skin.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Take it off.
 <br>
 - Why is everyone against me? - Because you&#39;re telling a girl to keep her top on.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Take it off.
 <br>
 [Phones Ringing] - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hello.
 <br>
 - Go ahead.
 <br>
 - After you.
 <br>
 - Here.
 <br>
 Let me, um- - I know how it goes.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Just- I&#39;m just trying to help.
 <br>
 Now it&#39;s stuck! You just have to give it a yank.
 <br>
 This is just like last night! Okay.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Red? I just found out he called my daughter a dumb-ass.
 <br>
 - What? - Well, I really thought I was getting through to him.
 <br>
 But then he snuck a &#34;dumb-ass&#34; in.
 <br>
 That is a hurtful word.
 <br>
 You got to do something about your husband, Kitty.
 <br>
 You guys&#39;d be lucky to get Donna.
 <br>
 If anything, she&#39;s gonna pretty your family up.
 <br>
 Excuse me? I&#39;m just sayin&#39;, we&#39;re a voluptuous bunch.
 <br>
 Mom, you need to talk to Dad.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re surprised he&#39;s upset.
 <br>
 Why did you have to get engaged? And why did you have to tell your father? He&#39;s not stable, Eric.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll talk to him myself.
 <br>
 Eric, be careful.
 <br>
 I looked deep into Red&#39;s eyes, and I saw- Well, I just saw me upside down and tiny, but he looked mad.
 <br>
 You know what? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going down to Price Mart.
 <br>
 And if I don&#39;t come back, then, Donna, please move on with your life.
 <br>
 Wedding or no wedding, we&#39;re still getting one of those triple-decker cakes.
 <br>
 Oh, working with someone you have had sex with is the worst thing ever.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know how Donny and Marie do it.
 <br>
 You know, sex ruins everything.
 <br>
 No, I disagree, Fez.
 <br>
 I mean, sure, the first time can be awkward.
 <br>
 Well, it wasn&#39;t for me and Jackie.
 <br>
 You know, maybe I should tell the story.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a great story, Hyde.
 <br>
 You know what, Kelso? It&#39;s gettin&#39; real old.
 <br>
 And the story I remember after your first time was you didn&#39;t call her for a week.
 <br>
 I was gonna skip that part.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t call me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s because he was thinking about breaking up with you.
 <br>
 What? No, I told you.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t call you &#39;cause we were having our phones cleaned! And then to get back on your good side he bought you a stupid stuffed unicorn.
 <br>
 Fluffycakes? Fluffycakes is tainted? See, he wanted something from you.
 <br>
 So he bought you a present.
 <br>
 Sound familiar? Michael, why did you buy me this sweater? All right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s time to come clean.
 <br>
 I stole the sweater! Fine.
 <br>
 You know what? Forget it.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want it, so just take it.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;re talking.
 <br>
 Give us a little dance.
 <br>
 [Inhales, Exhales] Told you it wouldn&#39;t work.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t doing anything! Hey, let&#39;s not fight.
 <br>
 We all saw a littleJackie side-boob.
 <br>
 I think we all won.
 <br>
 [Knocking] - Hi, Fez.
 <br>
 Okay, look- - Nina I know what you&#39;re going to say.
 <br>
 The other night was awful, and you just want to be friends.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I was going to say, the other night was awful and we should practice and get better at it.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I have to say, I don&#39;t hate the sound of that.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] So, um, uh, should I make an appointment, or- - Just get in the house.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 One second.
 <br>
 [Singsongy] I&#39;m going to do it again! I&#39;m going to do it again! Okay, Dad.
 <br>
 You can ignore me and you can call my girlfriend names, but here&#39;s the thing.
 <br>
 Donna and I are getting married.
 <br>
 Okay? Whether you like it or not.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re too young.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re throwing your life away.
 <br>
 Wha-You said I was throwing my life away when I quit T-ball.
 <br>
 And I was right about that too.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not marrying her, and that&#39;s final.
 <br>
 Well, Dad, you can&#39;t stop me.
 <br>
 Okay? I&#39;m gonna be graduating soon.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be on my own.
 <br>
 I have a job.
 <br>
 I mean, I make enough money to pay for the wedding myself.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] But you don&#39;t have a job.
 <br>
 You&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 - What? - You&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see you pay for a wedding now.
 <br>
 Punch out and empty your locker.
 <br>
 Fine! - But I&#39;m keeping the smock! - Give me the smock! - Jackie.
 <br>
 - Hmm? Happy birthday.
 <br>
 Steven, you shouldn&#39;t have! Oh! It&#39;s a Led Zeppelin T-shirt.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s used! Yeah, that&#39;s my favorite one.
 <br>
 You&#39;re with me now, so I wanted you to have it.
 <br>
 Oh! Steven, I love it! - Do I have to wear it? - No.
 <br>
 [Gasps] Steven, I love it! Oh! Well, that was a nice Who wants a little kick in their coffee? I know I do.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the dumb-ass! [Grunts]
 <br>
