<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 - Good morning.
 <br>
 I have terrible news.
 <br>
 - Are we out of bacon? - No.
 <br>
 I was outside, and- - Remember that time we were out of bacon? Do I? Nearly tore this family apart.
 <br>
 Listen to me! Midge left Bob.
 <br>
 Are you sure? I mean, maybe she&#39;s just lost in the backyard.
 <br>
 ( Both Laughing ) This is serious.
 <br>
 I was up early, and I saw Midge getting into her car with a suitcase.
 <br>
 And I said, &#39;&#39;Where are you going, Midge?&#39;&#39; Because I&#39;m concerned, not nosy.
 <br>
 And she said to me, &#39;&#39;I am leaving Bob, and I am never coming back.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And I said, &#39;&#39;Okay.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And then I- I- I laughed like I do when I&#39;m uncomfortable.
 <br>
 ( Forced Laughing ) But what about Donna? I mean, what are they gonna do? Well, okay.
 <br>
 They are going to depend on the kindness of their friends and neighbors which is why we need to go over there as a family to comfort them.
 <br>
 - Yikes.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 - Why not? - Well, it just seems like it&#39;d be- like there&#39;d be an awful lot of- - Crying.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - So, no.
 <br>
 - Yeah, no.
 <br>
 Well, fine.
 <br>
 Then I will go myself.
 <br>
 Hey! Where are you going with my food? To Bob and Donna.
 <br>
 When your wife or mother leaves you, you need a good breakfast.
 <br>
 I need a good breakfast.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t leave you.
 <br>
 Eat a Pop-Tart.
 <br>
 When I woke up, her bag was packed and she left.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t even say where she was going.
 <br>
 On the other hand we have pancakes with egg eyes and bacon smiley faces! ( Kitty Laughs ) The hash-brown hair is nice.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe she would just take off without even a hint or a warning.
 <br>
 No warning? Dad, she was always saying, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m unhappy, and I&#39;m gonna leave.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Honey, that&#39;s just what married people say.
 <br>
 Did she say where she was going? Well, she said she was going to California to- to be a star on Broadway.
 <br>
 So- Oh, Midgie.
 <br>
 She may not have been smart but she sure was sweet.
 <br>
 And built too, boy.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, but I&#39;m really not hungry.
 <br>
 Oh, what a nightmare.
 <br>
 She was unhappy, Bob.
 <br>
 No, she took the Eldorado.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! So Midge just took off? Ah, poor Donna.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is really bad.
 <br>
 Yeah, not only did Donna lose her mom we all lost Midge&#39;s sweet, uptown rack.
 <br>
 Oh, good God, man, what a marvelous set of kittens.
 <br>
 - Remember that sweater? - Oh.
 <br>
 Remember the other sweater? Yeah.
 <br>
 Remember that time she ran up to us in a sweater? Remember the week she took up jump rope? In a sweater? Eric! What are you boys thinking about so hard? - Nothing.
 <br>
 - Homework.
 <br>
 -Jesus.
 <br>
 - Kittens.
 <br>
 Okay, um, Eric, I need you to take a casserole to the Pinciottis.
 <br>
 So run upstairs and put on a nice, clean shirt and a sport coat.
 <br>
 What? No, I&#39;m not going over there.
 <br>
 Donna and I broke up, and things are weird with us.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 Because I went over there, and Bob&#39;s a crier and a hugger.
 <br>
 And when you get caught in a crying-Bob hug, there is no escape.
 <br>
 And I cannot go back over there! I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I like to be hugged by Bob.
 <br>
 He makes me feel safe.
 <br>
 Okay, okay, there he is.
 <br>
 Go talk to him.
 <br>
 No, Kitty.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a personal matter, and I- Oh! That&#39;s mature.
 <br>
 Oh, hey there, Red! Hi, Bob.
 <br>
 What a day, huh? What a day to be alive.
 <br>
 I feel great.
 <br>
 You do? Well, then I can go back inside.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Yup, Midgie&#39;s been on me for weeks to weed the garden.
 <br>
 I&#39;m finally gettin&#39; around to it, so when she comes back, she&#39;s gonna see that I did it.
 <br>
 You think she&#39;s coming back? Well, why shouldn&#39;t she? I did all the right things.
 <br>
 We had an open marriage, experimented with drugs.
 <br>
 I even threw nudist parties.
 <br>
 Yeah, what more could a husband do? All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not get bummed out, guys, okay? There are a lot of other hot older women out there besides Midge.
 <br>
 And they deserve our respect, &#39;cause they can teach us stuff.
 <br>
 Yes, I would love to make love to an 80-year-old.
 <br>
 They must know everything.
 <br>
 And not just about sex, but history and trivia too.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 The young ones are too timid, but the older ones- They know it won&#39;t break.
 <br>
 How could it break? It is invincible.
 <br>
 Yeah, and plus, they&#39;re, like, grateful you know, so they&#39;ll do it with, like, almost anybody.
 <br>
 Anybody? Well, that&#39;s me! Let&#39;s find Fez a dirty housewife to love.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Hyde? I don&#39;t know, guys.
 <br>
 I was gonna go watch Donahue.
 <br>
 What do you think the chances are of Fez gettin&#39; burned? - Pretty good.
 <br>
 - Damn good.
 <br>
 Then I am in.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 So hey, look, I&#39;m really sorry about your mom.
 <br>
 And, uh, I mean, are you okay? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you know, it won&#39;t make you feel any better but for some reason I brought you a casserole.
 <br>
 I mean, why is it that every time something bad happens, grown-ups always think you need food? You lost your job? Congratulations, you get a bucket of chicken! I mean, the last thing you want is to- Are these crushed potato chips? Look- Donna, look.
 <br>
 I know we broke up but I still, you know- I still care about you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So- Eric, in the bedroom.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, I knew that.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just- I&#39;m gonna- Is that a tennis getup? Yup.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m out.
 <br>
 What&#39;s his problem? This is the perfect outfit for picking up older ladies.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 How&#39;s that? Well, everyone knows that horny older ladies hang out at tennis clubs.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, see, Fez Point Place doesn&#39;t have a tennis club, or even a tennis court.
 <br>
 We do have that concrete wall behind the gym but people mostly use that just for smoking weed and beating up freshmen.
 <br>
 And foreign exchange students.
 <br>
 You were new, okay? No.
 <br>
 You know where we gotta go to get the ladies is the grocery store.
 <br>
 Oh, the Piggly Wiggly? I love the Piggly Wiggly.
 <br>
 They have candy.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And older ladies.
 <br>
 And candy.
 <br>
 Yeah, but the important thing is the older ladies! And candy.
 <br>
 All right, Fez.
 <br>
 What do you want, the older ladies or the candy? Fine, you win.
 <br>
 The older ladies.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 - And candy.
 <br>
 It was the sport coat, right? - Again? - Yes, please.
 <br>
 So, you don&#39;t want to cuddle? That&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 Bob thinks Midge is coming back? That is the saddest thing I ever heard.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Kitty.
 <br>
 Let him think it.
 <br>
 Who does it hurt? It hurts Bob.
 <br>
 Well, who else does it hurt? - ( Chuckles ) - Steven.
 <br>
 Red, Bob has to grieve so the healing can begin.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) But, Kitty, then he&#39;ll grieve all over me.
 <br>
 Hey, remember that time Bob ate a bad taco and grieved all inside your car? Thank you.
 <br>
 Case closed.
 <br>
 Why would you bring that up? Well, sorry, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that it was gross, so I think about it a lot.
 <br>
 Hi, kids.
 <br>
 Good to see you.
 <br>
 Good to see you.
 <br>
 Someone is looking lovely today, Mom.
 <br>
 What&#39;s with you, man? I guess a little thing like getting back together with your old gal puts a spring in a man&#39;s step.
 <br>
 You and Donna are back together? That is wonderful! So, did you talk things through? No.
 <br>
 Then how do you know you&#39;re back together? Yeah, we talked things through.
 <br>
 Talked or grunted? Stifle.
 <br>
 Okay, well, good.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna need details.
 <br>
 Oh, there will be details aplenty in my steamy letter to Penthouse.
 <br>
 Okay, my mom&#39;s still behind me, isn&#39;t she? (Jackie, Hyde ) So, you guys did it? Twice.
 <br>
 Five times! Nice.
 <br>
 Yech! (Jackie, Hyde ) And you&#39;re back together? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 God, no.
 <br>
 It was like magic.
 <br>
 Oh, I feel sick.
 <br>
 Yup, we&#39;re back together.
 <br>
 And, Hyde, more than this, much more than this- ( Singing Pop ) I&#39;m sure he&#39;s forgotten all about it.
 <br>
 ( Continues ) ( Ends ) Man, back when I was cheating on Jackie I used to meet a ton of older ladies here.
 <br>
 Hello, Michael.
 <br>
 Hey,Joyce.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s Coach Ferguson&#39;s wife! Yeah.
 <br>
 She&#39;s lonely, and she drinks.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re a Piggly Wiggly god.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Ooh la la! Oh, me like.
 <br>
 Well, make your move, man.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Ay, no.
 <br>
 After I painted Midge&#39;s bathroom pink sprinkled a little lavender water in her toilet like she likes I went out and got these chocolates.
 <br>
 I hope she likes &#39;em.
 <br>
 I guess we&#39;ll find out when she comes back, huh? Bob, she- I- Aw, Bob, you poor, dumb son of a bitch.
 <br>
 That&#39;s mean.
 <br>
 Bob, she&#39;s not comin&#39; back.
 <br>
 - Yes, she is.
 <br>
 - No, she&#39;s not.
 <br>
 - Yes, she is.
 <br>
 - No, she&#39;s not.
 <br>
 - Yes, she is.
 <br>
 - No, she&#39;s not! - Yes, she is! - Fine! These chocolates are for Midge, Bob? They&#39;re for Midge? Fine! Let&#39;s give &#39;em to Midge! Here you go, Midge! You&#39;re throwing away Midgie&#39;s chocolates.
 <br>
 And why would I do that, Bob? &#39;Cause you&#39;re mean! And why else? She&#39;s not coming back, is she? I knew that.
 <br>
 Listen, you wanna go get a beer? Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) You&#39;re a good friend.
 <br>
 I might cry.
 <br>
 And I might hit you.
 <br>
 Michael, how could you bring poor, sweet Fez to the Piggly Wiggly? There are a lot of footloose women in that store.
 <br>
 Do you know Joyce Ferguson? Who? No! That&#39;s a lie! - What? - What? - What? - What? And you! Grabbing strange rear ends is no way to meet a nice girl.
 <br>
 It&#39;s rude, ungentlemanly behavior that will not be appreciated by a woman of class.
 <br>
 And thank you for the compliment.
 <br>
 It made my day.
 <br>
 You know what I just noticed? Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman is hot.
 <br>
 Yeah, she&#39;s a cutie.
 <br>
 And firm.
 <br>
 You know, maybe we should get her a sweater for Christmas.
 <br>
 She actually doesn&#39;t want to be with you at all.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that hilarious? Yeah, he thinks you&#39;re back together.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really sad.
 <br>
 ( Donna, Eric ) Hold on.
 <br>
 What? Look, she said she would&#39;ve done it with anybody.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Donna wouldn&#39;t say that.
 <br>
 I mean, it was like I would have done it with anybody.
 <br>
 Anybody? Damn, and I was just over there watching stupid Donahue.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s do it right now.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s gonna be so mad.
 <br>
 - (Jackie ) Are you mad? - ( Eric ) So mad.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m just kidding about the &#39;&#39;do it&#39;&#39; stuff.
 <br>
 - ( Hyde ) I&#39;m sorry about your mom.
 <br>
 - ( Donna ) Thanks.
 <br>
 You know what? That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 She can&#39;t use me like this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m goin&#39; over there to yell at her right now! With yelling! Seriously, let&#39;s do it right now.
 <br>
 Okay, listen.
 <br>
 You need to tell me what the hell you think you&#39;re doing! What am I doing? Well, my mom left us so I&#39;m boxing up her clothes, because I can&#39;t look at them anymore.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry for needing you, but I did.
 <br>
 So if you have something to say to me,just say it.
 <br>
 Okay, thank you! I did have something to say, and it was good! But that was before you said your mom stuff and your sad clothes stuff and now my s-sex stuff sounds sucky.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m sorry if you thought that we- No.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just-What- ( Clears Throat ) What, do you need some help or something? Yeah, thanks.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 This is mine.
 <br>
 - ( Stifled Laugh ) - Midge borrowed it, and she never gave it back.
 <br>
 I bet my bra&#39;s here too.
 <br>
 I miss my li&#39;l Midgers.
 <br>
 Bob, you know the rules.
 <br>
 You cry, you buy.
 <br>
 Three pitchers, please.
 <br>
 ( Sobbing ) Hi.
 <br>
 ( Sobbing Continues )
