<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Ahhh Kitty.
 <br>
 Making brownies for breakfast? No.
 <br>
 Brownies have too much sugar to be a healthy breakfast.
 <br>
 Here, have some Fun Time Smack A Doodles.
 <br>
 Ah, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, can I borrow your curling iron? I was gonna borrow Donna&#39;s but hers smells like potatoes.
 <br>
 It wasn&#39;t my fault! My Dad used it to make curly fries.
 <br>
 Well I wanna look good for my first full day of work at the TV-station.
 <br>
 I wanna look super pretty, so my co-workers don&#39;t mind when I stab them in the back.
 <br>
 You try my hairstyling technique: &#34;Wake up, remove pillow&#34;.
 <br>
 You know, I am just so excited for you working for TV&#39;s Christine St.
 <br>
 George.
 <br>
 She is my hero.
 <br>
 She&#39;s amazing, she&#39;s talented She&#39;s the devil.
 <br>
 She seems sweet to me.
 <br>
 Last week, she was having a lot of fun with this dog that could say Christine.
 <br>
 It sounded like &#34;Wruurrreeennn&#34;.
 <br>
 It was pretty good! Okay.
 <br>
 Rumor has it that as soon as the cameras went off, she had that dog neutered.
 <br>
 Well I just can not believe that a woman who makes her own pot-pourri could be that bad.
 <br>
 Now if you&#39;re still nervous about her, justjust do what I did when I first started at the hospital.
 <br>
 Kitty I don&#39;t think she is allowed to bring Kahlua to work.
 <br>
 No you justyou bring in some treats and put them on your desk.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I did with my awful boss.
 <br>
 Now he loves me, he weight 300 pounds and he sweats when he ties his shoes I win! Here, take some brownies.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Well I guess it is true what they say.
 <br>
 Keep your friends close and your enemies fat.
 <br>
 You know, if you want to impress them, do a good job.
 <br>
 If your job is making coffee, make coffee.
 <br>
 If your job is answering phones, answer phones.
 <br>
 If your job is sharpening pencils Get a new job, cause that one blows.
 <br>
 You know what, this one, I&#39;ll try anything cause Christine is a bitch.
 <br>
 You know, that is SUCH a double standard.
 <br>
 Why is it okay for a man to be a hard-ass boss but when a woman is, she&#39;s labeled a bitch.
 <br>
 Cause Christine&#39;s a bitch! Good morning Jackie! How are you enjoying your time behind the scenes at the fifth larges TV market in Wisconsin? I don&#39;t knowI&#39;m working pretty hard Well good.
 <br>

 Why are we celebrating that? The boy is just clumsy.
 <br>
 Listen I&#39;m sorry I yelled at you earlier.
 <br>
 Urgh, you must think I&#39;m a complete psycho.
 <br>
 It was completely my fault.
 <br>
 I should have just moved out of the way when you threw that script at me.
 <br>
 No, no, not at all, because if you had, the script would have gone flying right past you and might&#39;ve hit somebody important What are you listening to? Nothing.
 <br>
 Hyde is always giving me crap about my poofy hair, so I use these sweet babies to hold it down.
 <br>
 Oh my God, look at David Bowie.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got a nicer ass then I do! Randy, this is where you disagree! I&#39;d like to Donna, but he is wearing a dress.
 <br>
 You&#39;re wearing jeans.
 <br>
 I&#39;m very confused.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I gotta go to work, but before I do, I have to do one thing HAHAHAHA! Re-poofed your hair! Hey Randy, can you help that chick sitting on the couch? Oh wait.
 <br>
 That&#39;s you.
 <br>
 Guys.
 <br>
 Who put a sandwich in the cash register? You can pay for things with sandwiches?! Helloooo Hawaii! I did that Hyde.
 <br>
 Sorry man.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ve been a little scatterbrained lately.
 <br>
 It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Cause I remember when I first met you I thought that guy is focused! Yeah.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve been acting kinda weird even for you.
 <br>
 Are you sober? No Aquarius.
 <br>
 So what&#39;s wrong? I got a crush on someone.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t know what to do about it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s been al long time since I&#39;ve wooed a lady.
 <br>
 First of, no-one uses the phrase woo a lady anymore.
 <br>
 THAT&#39;s why the girl at the hub slapped me! No man, she slapped you because you grabbed her ass and yelled: WOOOO a lady! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, your brownies saved my life! Christine was yelling at me all morning, but then I gave her one of your brownies and then she started liking me! Oh I don&#39;t believe that for a minute.
 <br>
 I could eat a whole tray of those brownies and I still wouldn&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Television&#39;s Christine St.
 <br>
 George LOVES my brownies, this is so exciting! I am IN a famous person&#39;s stomach RIGHT NOW! Okay, well I need some more for tomorrow socould you make some? Oh.
 <br>
 I just umI just put Red&#39;s chicken pot pie in the oven so Here honey, eat around the chicken, it is probably loaded with bacteria.
 <br>
 Alright Leo, the problem that most guys have with picking up chicks is that they over think things.
 <br>
 So you should be fine.
 <br>
 All you have to say to a lady is &#34;Come here often?&#34;.
 <br>
 If she says no, grab her ass.
 <br>
 You know she won&#39;t be coming back, so you won&#39;t have to see her again.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Look, I got an idea.
 <br>
 Pretend we&#39;re at a bar and the three of us are foxy ladies.
 <br>
 Oeh, I&#39;m a recent college graduate with big boobs and an urge to explore! How&#39;s your daddy? Okay now, try to pick one of us up.
 <br>
 What are you doing man? You look the lightest.
 <br>
 All right, put me down.
 <br>
 Okay You&#39;re dumb and lazy There&#39;s my lady! Excuse me you&#39;re blocking the aisle.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hi Leo.
 <br>
 Come here often? Wow JJ! Seven jojo&#39;s at one time! I guess an act like that really has it&#39;s ups and downs huh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad I fought for my country so that grown man can play with his jojo.
 <br>
 Oh shushy-shushy grumpety-grump.
 <br>
 Now before we go, I&#39;d like to introduce the newest family member of What&#39;s Up Wisconsin.
 <br>
 She&#39;s my assistant.
 <br>
 She&#39;s Jackie Burkhart! Come on honey, come on in here! Oh my God, I&#39;m on TV! Well for all of you watching in black and white, I am wearing a navy twin set, my eye shadow is periwinkle blue HOLY MACARONI! It&#39;s Jackie! I know someone who is on TV! Waddaya know.
 <br>
 It really IS an idiot box.
 <br>
 Jackie brings me the most delicious brownies.
 <br>
 BROWNIES! Red, those are my brownies! Oh, they look so much bigger on TV.
 <br>
 So moist, you don&#39;t even have to drink milk with them.
 <br>
 NO MILK! That is the HIGHEST compliment a brownie can have! Now Jackie darling, I must know where you got them! FROM ME! SHE GOT THEM FROM ME!! Got them? I made them.
 <br>
 Myself.
 <br>
 What? It&#39;s an old Burkhart family recipe.
 <br>
 YOU LYING LITTLE MIDGET! This might be a bad time to ask.
 <br>
 But are you gonna start getting lunch together? I can&#39;t believe Leo likes me! I feel like I&#39;m back in the third grade and the slow kid who picks his nose just gave me a Valentine.
 <br>
 See, that is what you get for leading Leo on.
 <br>
 With your tight jeans and your heaving chest and your large bedroom window.
 <br>
 You know, there is a good chance Leo forgets this whole thing.
 <br>
 Just like he forgot that other thing.
 <br>
 The sixties.
 <br>
 Well what am I gonna do? I don&#39;t wanna hurt his feelings.
 <br>
 Donna, I know this is weird for you, but you have to remember, it is Hi-Larious for us.
 <br>
 I think Leo and you could be great together.
 <br>
 I can see it now I have to go talk to him! I ain&#39;t havin&#39; no Leo-baby! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman you gotta help me! I need another batch of brownies and I need them bad! Okay.
 <br>
 First, preheat the oven to 350, then stick your head inside and bake the lies out of your lying mouth you little liar! Please! It&#39;s the only thing that keeps Christine of my back.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna lose my job, please, you&#39;ve gotta help me! Please.
 <br>
 ! Oh that is SO fake.
 <br>
 Oh damn fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Well Christine caught me off guard I was on TV, I didn&#39;t know what to say.
 <br>
 How about Kitty Forman baked the brownies? See how easy that was? I can even say it backwards.
 <br>
 Brownies the baked Forman Kitty.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 But now I&#39;m in too deep, so I am begging you: please could you just make some more brownies? Drop it Jackie.
 <br>
 I am not gonna let you continue to take credit for all of my hard work.
 <br>
 What if I take you to the studio and introduce you to Christine St.
 <br>
 George? I&#39;ll get the eggs, you grease the pan! Hyde, I thought you said Leo was supposed to be here today? Yeah.
 <br>
 I put him on the schedule.
 <br>
 Which means he is either on his way in, or on his way to San Francisco to see the Dud Show.
 <br>
 I just wanna get this over with.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be so hard.
 <br>
 Donna, I know how you must feel.
 <br>
 Soft and smooth - There&#39;s my girl! - Hi Leo.
 <br>
 Leo, you didn&#39;t have to get me chocolates.
 <br>
 Chocolates? That&#39;s my lunch.
 <br>
 Leo, look.
 <br>
 I am really flattered that you like me.
 <br>
 ButI can&#39;t be your girlfriend.
 <br>
 Is it because I&#39;m black? You&#39;re not black.
 <br>
 So, it&#39;s not that then.
 <br>
 I know what it is, you like that Randy guy.
 <br>
 What? No, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yes, you do.
 <br>
 So I think maybe it&#39;s best that we stop seeing each other.
 <br>
 Wait a minute, you&#39;re breaking up with me? I&#39;m sorry but I just can&#39;t date a racist.
 <br>
 So man, how did it go? He thinks I like Randy! Can you believe that? Donna.
 <br>
 Leo has never been right about anything in his life.
 <br>
 Except for the fact that you&#39;re into Randy.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? Hiii Randy, I like music, do you like music toooooo? Shut up.
 <br>
 Look at my butt! I made it just for youououuu! You are so far off! Come in man, you&#39;re in the store more then I am! You giggle at everything he says.
 <br>
 You guys are like a bad Carpenter song.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like any Carpenter song! Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Maybe I like him a little bit.
 <br>
 But if you tell anyone I will freakin&#39; kick your ass.
 <br>
 You bitch! So Leo, you&#39;re single again.
 <br>
 You gonna be ok? Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve already got my eye on somebody better.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Hey.

 <br>
 This is Kitty Forman - Hello.
 <br>

 <br>
 Ohhh it is such an honor to meet you.
 <br>
 You look so much taller in person.
 <br>
 Of course we only have a nineteen inch TV-set.
 <br>
 Okayyy.
 <br>
 I also brought you some brownies.
 <br>
 Oh isn&#39;t that wonderful of her.
 <br>
 You know Jackie, I was thinking that on tomorrow&#39;s show you and I might make these brownies.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;d stir the eggs and I&#39;d come up with some funny yolks.
 <br>
 A cooking segment?! Oh that is justthat is justjust my dream come true! For you OhMs.
 <br>
 St.
 <br>
 George, I have to tell you something.
 <br>

 <br>
 My fake casa is you fake casa! Okay Ms.
 <br>
 St.
 <br>
 George, I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 No.

 What you showed me just now, proves that you are a sweet, honest, young woman.
 <br>
 And that CRAP will get you nowhere in show business! So what? Am I supposed to lie and cheat and take credit for other people&#39;s work? That&#39;s how I paid for my Mercedes.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t be afraid to be tough.
 <br>
 Oh I&#39;m tough.
 <br>
 I&#39;m very very tough.
 <br>
 People always say what a bitch I am! Well, for your sake, I hope they&#39;re right! Now please, get this crazy lady off my set.

 Coming up next A potato chip that looks like Henry Kissinger See if you can find that potato chip.
 <br>
 It sounds fascinating.
 <br>
 Before we bring up the tap-dancing parrot, I have a correction to make from yesterday&#39;s show.
 <br>
 RED! She&#39;s gonna say me name! Are you taping it? Do you know how to use the machine?! YESI know how to use the machine Those brownies I so enjoyed were made by the talented and lovely Kitty Forshack.
 <br>
