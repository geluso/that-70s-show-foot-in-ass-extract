 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 L&#39;Eggo my foot in your ass.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Good morning.
 <br>
 Oh, here, honey.
 <br>
 I brought you something back from the hospital.
 <br>
 A lollipop.
 <br>
 Mom, I&#39;m 1 7 years old.
 <br>
 Which is why I also brought you condoms.
 <br>
 ( Red, Eric Groaning ) Well, see, we had a teenage mom come in, and it&#39;s just- Well, you know, I worry about you.
 <br>
 That I&#39;ll get pregnant? You&#39;re not a good nurse.
 <br>
 Now, don&#39;t be a porky mouth.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Sexual health pamphlets.
 <br>
 ( Red, Eric Groaning ) I just want you to know that intercourse is a responsibility, not just a right.
 <br>
 Okay, well, this couldn&#39;t be more uncomfortable.
 <br>
 Oh, uh, don&#39;t forget your condoms.
 <br>
 I was wrong! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Hey, man, Red&#39;s been spot-checking my room again.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe he still doesn&#39;t trust me.
 <br>
 You know, that really hurts, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna need you to hide my stash.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll put it in my dresser under my Hong Kong Phooey socks.
 <br>
 He can protect anything, because he&#39;s faster than the human eye! You guys, the funniest thing just happened toJackie.
 <br>
 Michael, the most horrible thing just happened to me.
 <br>
 My father found out we&#39;re back together.
 <br>
 And if we don&#39;t break up, he&#39;ll never give me any money ever again.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 If you break up with Kelso, you&#39;ll be rich? Talk about your win-win.
 <br>
 Hold on.
 <br>
 He didn&#39;t know we were dating? Here comes the best part.
 <br>
 I mean the worst part.
 <br>
 My dad thinks you&#39;re a bad influence on me, so I kept our love a secret.
 <br>
 And now, I have to decide between you and money.
 <br>
 Gosh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like Sophie&#39;s Choice for morons.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s take a poll.
 <br>
 Who thinks Sophie should keep Kelso? - The money? - Ooh! - You guys, this isn&#39;t a joke.
 <br>
 - But it&#39;s funny like a joke.
 <br>
 How do I choose between something that makes my whole life complete and you? Well, I don&#39;t know, baby, but I love you.
 <br>
 Oh, Michael, I love you too.
 <br>
 Okay, I choose love.
 <br>
 I choose love! Aw! Yeah, aw! Okay.
 <br>
 Now get a job, because I need a ton of money.
 <br>
 Guys, I would like you to meet Point Place&#39;s new foreign exchange student, Thomas.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s up? Hello, pretty lady with eyes like the sea.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Which sea? Okay, easy there, Casa-new-guy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m showing Thomas the ropes.
 <br>
 - Hello.
 <br>
 - What, are you crazy? That&#39;s Nicole Mayzell.
 <br>
 She&#39;s way out of our league.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Then we must be in different leagues because I just had sex with her last night.
 <br>
 Oh-ho-ho! New foreign guy: uno.
 <br>
 Old foreign guy: nada.
 <br>
 This is outrageous! The closest I have come to sex was when the football team pinned me down in the shower and made me kiss my own ass! Hey, um, if you think that&#39;s close to sex then you&#39;re gonna be delighted with actual sex.
 <br>
 Yeah, Thomas, you should stay away from the football team for a while.
 <br>
 We wouldn&#39;t want a cutie like you to get hurt.
 <br>
 Oh, the football team loves me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m their new placekicker! What? Oh, the room is spinning! How did you do all this? I have delightful accent.
 <br>
 So do I.
 <br>
 Yes, but a nerd with an accent is still a nerd.
 <br>
 Now, good day, sir.
 <br>
 I say &#39;&#39;good day.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Now, good day.
 <br>
 - Good day.
 <br>
 - Good day.
 <br>
 - I said, good day! - I said, good day! - He stole that from me.
 <br>
 - But, Fez- I said, from me! ( Radio: SoftJazz ) Oh, I&#39;m out.
 <br>
 Out? I am home one night this week, and you&#39;re out? Hey, don&#39;t look at me.
 <br>
 You had a whole bag of&#39;em, and you wasted &#39;em on Eric! He&#39;s probably down there making balloon animals.
 <br>
 Well I guess we&#39;ll just sleep.
 <br>
 Well, couldn&#39;t we just, uh- You know, I mean, really, what are the chances? ( Gasps ) We could have a change-of-life baby! Oh, crap.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 It&#39;s late.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll talk about this tomorrow.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 My sock drawer.
 <br>
 I&#39;m dead! He found your stash! Do you know what this means? Yeah.
 <br>
 I get your room, and you get sent to military school.
 <br>
 Eric caught me stealing his things.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not funny.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a grown man.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t go rummaging around in teenage boys&#39; drawers - looking for things.
 <br>
 - Condoms.
 <br>
 That word is forbidden! Okay.
 <br>
 Good night.
 <br>
 - Condoms.
 <br>
 - Quit it! ( Laughter) I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve just always been good-looking.
 <br>
 Look at that foreign bastard cracking up the whores.
 <br>
 Checking the score.
 <br>
 Old foreign guy: nada.
 <br>
 New foreign guy: dos.
 <br>
 Hey, if I pretend to say something funny, will you laugh? No.
 <br>
 That Thomas is shady.
 <br>
 But have you noticed he never says what country he&#39;s from? What country are you from? What country are you from? America.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Mystery solved.
 <br>
 Psst.
 <br>
 Mom.
 <br>
 - Is Dad around? - No, I think he&#39;s upstairs.
 <br>
 Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot! Love you, Mom.
 <br>
 Thanks for breakfast.
 <br>
 See ya tonight.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Psst! Kitty, Eric around? No.
 <br>
 He just left.
 <br>
 Perfect! Red, this is just silly.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t avoid Eric forever.
 <br>
 - I know that.
 <br>
 - Well, good.
 <br>
 I just have to avoid him till he goes to college.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that, like, a year? I can do that.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;m broke.
 <br>
 I had to buy generic hair conditioner.
 <br>
 And now, I have split ends.
 <br>
 Oh, no one is gonna notice that, baby.
 <br>
 They&#39;ll all be looking at that monster zit.
 <br>
 I have to ration my cover-up.
 <br>
 So find a job already! I&#39;m tryin&#39;, okay? It&#39;s tough out there.
 <br>
 I just had an interview at that new store in the mall, the Cheese Palace.
 <br>
 - Where curd is king? - The very same.
 <br>
 They&#39;re hiring a new cheese maiden, you know, to hand out the samples.
 <br>
 - But I didn&#39;t get the job &#39;cause they want a girl.
 <br>
 - But you&#39;re pretty like a girl.
 <br>
 Thank you! Man, but the manager wants an actual girl- you know, with boobs and stuff.
 <br>
 Hey, you know who&#39;s an actual girl with boobs and stuff? Oh, Donna, you don&#39;t have to get a job just for me.
 <br>
 I was talking about you, pimple chin.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 I am not getting a job.
 <br>
 Ajob is for poor people.
 <br>
 I am a rich person who doesn&#39;t have money.
 <br>
 Big diff.
 <br>
 Hey, is that a blackhead? No! Cheddar? Cheddar? Cheddar? Try the Swiss.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t miss.
 <br>
 Try the cheddar! It&#39;s even better! The floor&#39;s real shiny, and I see your heinie.
 <br>
 - Oh! - Hey! The cheese maiden hit me! Cheese guards, seize her! My God, this job is awful! Are you sweating? I mean, is work making you sweat? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glistening! It&#39;s glisten! Whatever it is-Yech! Look, Michael the only reason I have this job is so that you and I can be together.
 <br>
 All you&#39;ve done for our love is sit in a basement eating Fritos.
 <br>
 Well, for your information if I send in I get a free remote-control car which I was gonna give to you after I played with it only a little.
 <br>
 Now, that is love! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! What I have to do is show everyone that I am cooler than Thomas.
 <br>
 You know, I once saw the Fonzie do something on TV that just might do the trick.
 <br>
 I am now going to jump over a shark on water skis to prove that I&#39;m the coolest foreign exchange student in Point Place.
 <br>
 - He&#39;ll never make it.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 He can do it.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the Fez! Okay, here I go.
 <br>
 Hit it! - Oh! - He&#39;s crazy, man! - He&#39;s crazy! - He&#39;s at the ramp! Ay! - Yes! - Fez! - Yeah, man! You suck, Thomas! Fez, you jumped that shark, and you&#39;re not even wet.
 <br>
 That&#39;s &#39;cause I&#39;m cool-a-mundo.
 <br>
 Ay! So, what do you think? Not only is that the worst idea I&#39;ve ever heard it was the worst moment in television history.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I stopped watching after that episode.
 <br>
 Thomas! This is freaky, man.
 <br>
 Red hasn&#39;t said anything about the stash which can only mean he&#39;s gone to the much-feared stage: beyond yelling.
 <br>
 He&#39;s gone Darth Vader, man.
 <br>
 Or instead of Red snagging you maybe you snagged Red dipping into Hyde&#39;s stash! I&#39;m just sayin&#39;, everyone&#39;s tryin&#39; it.
 <br>
 I guess Kelso&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Everyone is trying it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, this stuff isn&#39;t just for cakes.
 <br>
 It&#39;s great all by itself.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) Mmm! Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Watch this.
 <br>
 Look at me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Whipped-cream Head! Fear me! All fear Whipped-cream Head! ( Sinister Laughter) Mmm! Kelso, that was delightful.
 <br>
 But the only part you left out is where Red kills me! Forman, it was my stash.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna leave you hangin&#39;.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m gonna.
 <br>
 So good luck in military school.
 <br>
 How exciting! My first American road trip.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait to see Lake Dill-hole.
 <br>
 Well, the wait is over.
 <br>
 We&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Now, hop out, you crazy son of a gun.
 <br>
 This is the Michigan border.
 <br>
 - Well, what do you know.
 <br>
 - So where is Lake Dill-hole? Oh, it&#39;s right there behind the Get Bent Memorial.
 <br>
 So get bent, dill-hole! ( Tires Screeching ) What&#39;s the score now? Oh, here we go.
 <br>
 Fez: one.
 <br>
 Thomas: stranded in Michigan! Oh, I kill me.
 <br>
 Nice job.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 I learned from the best.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 I would&#39;ve taken his clothes.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why you&#39;re the king.
 <br>
 The Gouda&#39;s so good-a.
 <br>
 The Havarti&#39;s a party! Hello, milady.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;Fondue&#39;&#39; you love me? - Stop doing that! All day with this.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Hey, &#39;fondue&#39; me.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Ooh, I stepped in &#39;fon-dog-due.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;&#39; Oh, my God.
 <br>
 This is awful.
 <br>
 Michael, a few minutes ago, I smelled stinky cheese and it was me! Look, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I love you, but I can&#39;t do this.
 <br>
 You mean, you can&#39;t &#39;&#39;fondue&#39;&#39; it.
 <br>
 God, will you shut up! Look, I am not cut out for work.
 <br>
 I&#39;m cut out for having rich people give me things.
 <br>
 But you got a job for me.
 <br>
 I mean, doesn&#39;t that make you satisfied? Oh, my gosh! It&#39;s a check! And that&#39;s my name! Mine! So we can stay together! - Yeah, and I can still be rich! - Yeah! Well, if this isn&#39;t gonna go badly, I&#39;m heading home.
 <br>
 No, wait.
 <br>
 Jackie deserves a celebration.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s go buy me that remote-control car! No, Michael.
 <br>
 Money doesn&#39;t grow on trees.
 <br>
 Money doesn&#39;t grow on trees! You know, I think having a job is changing me.
 <br>
 Okay, think about it.
 <br>
 A whole new me.
 <br>
 ( Together) That&#39;d be great.
 <br>
 - I gotta- - I&#39;m gonna- - Okay, enough! You, sit.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t make me join the army, okay? I&#39;ll cut off a toe! - What? - Okay, okay.
 <br>
 We are just gonna clear the air.
 <br>
 Right now.
 <br>
 Now, Eric, the other night your father and I were getting intimate ( Red, Eric Groaning ) and we realized we didn&#39;t have any protection.
 <br>
 For hugging.
 <br>
 We just- We hug.
 <br>
 So your dad went to your room looking for one of those condoms I gave you and you caught him, and he has just been so embarrassed ever since.
 <br>
 Condoms? Oh! Condoms.
 <br>
 Yeah, condoms.
 <br>
 What did you think it was? What did you think it was? ( Together) What did you do? What did you do? I-I didn&#39;t do anything.
 <br>
 Okay? You stole condoms! Get him, Mom.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re grounded.
 <br>
 - For a week.
 <br>
 Hyde too.
 <br>
 Whatever was in that drawer that you didn&#39;t want me to see, I&#39;m sure it was his.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 No complaints here.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 You suppose there was actually something in that drawer he didn&#39;t want us to see? Who cares? I know in orientation we talked about theft in the workplace so I would like to report a theft from my check.
 <br>
 Now, I don&#39;t know who FICA is but that bitch stole, like, 1 0% of my money.
 <br>
 Also, now, I don&#39;t know if you have this key in your typewriter but when I write &#39;&#39;Jackie,&#39;&#39; I like to dot my &#39;&#39;I&#39;&#39; with a smiley face.
 <br>
 Also, now, I put this in the suggestion box, but- You have something hanging from your nose.
 <br>
 Oh, and I want Saturday off.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
