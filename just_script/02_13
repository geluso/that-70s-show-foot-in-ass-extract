 Look at this.
 <br>
 First day of deer season.
 <br>
 Rabbit season.
 <br>
 Duck season.
 <br>
 Rabbit season! Duck season! Wabbit season! Duck season! Well, Red, you havent been hunting in ages, not since the accident.
 <br>
 What accident? A really terrible accident thats none of your business.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, that one.
 <br>
 You know, why dont you go? It might be fun, get out of the house, get some fresh air, maybe get out of your lousy damn mood! Sorry.
 <br>
 Id love to go, Kitty, but we just cant afford it.
 <br>
 Oh, yes we can.
 <br>
 I will pack you some food and a nice box of bullets and youre on your way! Dad, you could use the Pinsciottis cabin.
 <br>
 Bob has a cabin? Well, isnt that just the cats ass? Oh, boo hoo, the worlds unfair.
 <br>
 Now just ask Bob if you can borrow his cabin.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Well go.
 <br>
 Just us guys.
 <br>
 Uh, mom? Well, you should go.
 <br>
 You dont spend nearly enough time with your father.
 <br>
 Thats because he doesnt like me.
 <br>
 Yes, he does like you.
 <br>
 And thats no excuse.
 <br>
 Well, I dont have a gun.
 <br>
 My mom took it when she left.
 <br>
 Well, you can share.
 <br>
 You know there is something about a gun that justmakes you wanna share! Ok, fine, mom, Ill go with dad, but if I dont come back youll know who did it.
 <br>
 You know, hes never really warmed up to you.
 <br>
 Going on seventeen years now.
 <br>
 Ok, were going hunting! Well, Yaaaaaay! With Bob.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, you know, maybe youll cheer up after you shoot something! I always do! Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Dont freak out, but if I see a deer on the side of the road, Im gonna shoot him! Kelso, you fire that gun in this car, and I will pull over and kick your ass for an hour.
 <br>
 Do it, Red, do it! Come on, Forman, would you get that gun away from him? No! I wanna hold it.
 <br>
 Give it up, Kelso.
 <br>
 I have a right to bear arms, all right? Thats in the constitution! Kelso, not everything in the constitution makes sense.
 <br>
 Whoa, Fez, shut up.
 <br>
 What did you say? Uh, nothing? Foreigners.
 <br>
 I hear ya.
 <br>
 So, so, so.
 <br>
 What to do.
 <br>
 I shoulda gone hunting.
 <br>
 No, no, no, we can have fun.
 <br>
 We can have our very own fun.
 <br>
 We could- Im not baking anything.
 <br>
 - Ohhhh! Ok! Who wants Jello? Jellos baking.
 <br>
 No, no, no! Jellos boiling!  Gotcha! Hey, Red.
 <br>
 So, tell me about that hunting accident.
 <br>
 Sounds like a funny story.
 <br>
 Think well see any bears? Id love to kill a bear.
 <br>
 You cant shoot a bear.
 <br>
 Its deer season! You shoot a bear, you get fined, you go to jail.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Ill just say it was self-defense.
 <br>
 Whos the jury gonna believe? Me, or a dead bear? Dead bear.
 <br>
 I killed a bear once.
 <br>
 Your ass.
 <br>
 I did! I did.
 <br>
 I was getting a drink from a spring, see.
 <br>
 When suddenly, I heard something.
 <br>
 Grabbed my shotgun, boom.
 <br>
 Right between the eyes.
 <br>
 Survival.
 <br>
 So, whatd you do then? You uhbring it home? Get it stuffed? Nope.
 <br>
 Left it there.
 <br>
 Went home.
 <br>
 How come you didnt bring it home? Get it stuffed? On account of it was so huge.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 So its a stand off.
 <br>
 I wont shave my legs, Bob wont shave his back.
 <br>
 Ok, eew.
 <br>
 You know, Red doesnt have a hairy back, can thank god for that.
 <br>
 No offense.
 <br>
 Good news for you, Donna! That means Eric probably wont have one either.
 <br>
 He cant even grow a moustache.
 <br>
 Oh, please.
 <br>
 Erics body is bald as can be.
 <br>
 You know, I dont even think he hit puberty until about fifteen! Really? Oh, he probably wont like that I said that.
 <br>
 I think Erics the sweetest kid.
 <br>
 So, Donna.
 <br>
 Have you and Eric Mother, please! The answers no.
 <br>
 Hey, hey! Everybody just shut up.
 <br>
 Well, I for one am not so naïve as to think that you and Eric- Aaaaahhhhhh!!! Ok, well, I guess were upsetting her, so, what should we do now? Well, if Donna wasnt so uptight, we could talk about- Im gonna go home.
 <br>
 You want me to go home? Cause I will.
 <br>
 Donna, please dont go home.
 <br>
 I think its very nice that youre spending time with your mother.
 <br>
 God knows Laurie wont.
 <br>
 You guys, lets play poker! I bet Im good at it! You never played poker before? Uh-uh.
 <br>
 But I have lots of money! Oh, well, honey, have a seat! Ill get the cards! Oh my god No! Damn! Damn, damn it all, damn! Kelso! What the hell are you doing? Well, I would be proudly standing over my kill right now if someone hadnt taken my gun away.
 <br>
 Kelso, you cant fire the gun in the camp! The deer walked right through here! He was mine, I was gonna hunt him! You know, Kelso, not every hunting accidentis an accident.
 <br>
 Think you better sit this one out, pal.
 <br>
 Fine! You know, I saw a deer blind on the way in, anybody wanna go check it out? Ill go.
 <br>
 No, not me.
 <br>
 I just came to hang out.
 <br>
 When I crave meat, I buy baloney.
 <br>
 So wheres Fez? Kelso probably shot him.
 <br>
 Oh, I saw him walking into the woods right after we got here.
 <br>
 Said he was going hunting.
 <br>
 He had a, a whistle and a stick! Ah, crazy foreign bastard.
 <br>
 Lets eat! Wow.
 <br>
 Those were some delicious birds.
 <br>
 Keychain? Nah, Im good.
 <br>
 So you caught those birds with just a whistle and a stick? Very impressive, Fez.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know, thats a good way to hunt.
 <br>
 Cause even if you dont get anything, you still have all the fun of a whistle and a stick.
 <br>
 Ill take the keychain.
 <br>
 Give it to Midge.
 <br>
 Little memento.
 <br>
 I feel good about that, Bob.
 <br>
 Midge is nice.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 We all like Midge.
 <br>
 Yeah, Midge has nice jugs.
 <br>
 What? What? No, you said something.
 <br>
 No I didnt.
 <br>
 So, whats up with your hair, huh? Man, I am at one with nature right now.
 <br>
 Thanks for the pheasant, Fez.
 <br>
 Pheasant, Fez, pheasant, Fez Yes.
 <br>
 Beautiful black pheasants.
 <br>
 Black pheasants.
 <br>
 Wait, pheasants arent black.
 <br>
 Well, black is beautiful.
 <br>
 I wish Jackie were black.
 <br>
 What did you feed us, Fez? They were pheasants! They went, Cu caw! Cu caw! You fed us a crow? Youre not supposed to eat a crow, man! You just brought some bad juju on us all! We ate somebodys soul, man! Aye, no.
 <br>
 I have eaten someones delicious soul.
 <br>
 Hey, good news, guys, I found my gun! What? Its probably not loaded.
 <br>
 Oh, wow, mom, youre not good.
 <br>
 Well, youre not even playing, so keep it to yourself, Miss Smarty.
 <br>
 Ok, Ill play.
 <br>
 You wanna play cards with your mother? Sure! Well I am gonna call the Milwaukee Journal! Kitty? How many kings are in a pack? Four.
 <br>
 I bet a dollar.
 <br>
 Well, um.
 <br>
 I see that there are four queens in a deck, too.
 <br>
 Oh, mom, that is so pathetic.
 <br>
 Fine, I fold.
 <br>
 Im in.
 <br>
 Ok, uh, do you want any cards? Yeah.
 <br>
 Can I have two fives please? And Ill have one card.
 <br>
 Oh, its five.
 <br>
 Jackie, did you want this? You gave her a five? I thought we were friends! Ok! You know what? Everybody just show your cards.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Did I win? Did I win? Did I win? Not even close.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I dont care.
 <br>
 I dont work, so money doesnt really mean anything to me.
 <br>
 Oh, how nice for you.
 <br>
 Hey, dad, I dont know about you but Im kinda frozen to the blind.
 <br>
 Right in the pants area.
 <br>
 Shh! Geez, you have done nothing but complain since we got here.
 <br>
 You know, I was hoping that this trip would be better than the lastwhere you cried about every stupid thing.
 <br>
 I was six.
 <br>
 And you made me touch a dead rabbit! I just thought that if you touched it, you might not be afraid of it.
 <br>
 Well, thank you, Dr.
 <br>
 Spock.
 <br>
 Making noise is not the way to bag a deer.
 <br>
 Had nightmares for a month.
 <br>
 Big, dead rabbit nightmares.
 <br>
 Oh man! We got one! He is huge! Where? I dont see it! Its about a quarter click south of the clearing.
 <br>
 What is a click? And which way is south? Oh, no, wait, ok, I see him! Yeah! Oh, youre right dad, he is huge! Youre not kidding.
 <br>
 Id say hes a ten pointer! What? I was just thinking.
 <br>
 You take the shot.
 <br>
 N-no way! You always talk about getting a buck.
 <br>
 You do it.
 <br>
 No, damn it, now dont argue with me, now take the shot! Come on! Hurry up! Oh, and dont shoot him in the face! Holy cow, look at him go.
 <br>
 Man, you really stink.
 <br>
 I told you to take the shot.
 <br>
 I just thought it would be nice for you to get a deer, I mean, god knows Id love to get one.
 <br>
 Then you should have taken the shot! What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you always so damn nervous? Oh, hmm, I dont know, maybe its because youve been yelling at me for seventeen years? Oh, I have not.
 <br>
 Oh, god, he was right there! I, I coulda hit him with a rock! Yep, thats a damn shame.
 <br>
 So you ready to head back? No, I sure as hell am not ready to head back.
 <br>
 You wanna go back? You go back.
 <br>
 So, hey dad, how bout a war story? Yeah, ok.
 <br>
 I ever tell you about the time Ididnt miss that North Korean? Full house, jacks over tens! Mom wins again! Well, this is fun! Isnt this fun? It was fun til Laurie started dealing.
 <br>
 Hey, whats that supposed to mean? Oh my gosh! I think Mrs.
 <br>
 Pinsciottis saying that Lauries cheating! No, shes not.
 <br>
 Wait! Yes I am.
 <br>
 My daughter does not cheat.
 <br>
 Come on, Donna.
 <br>
 Were storming out of here.
 <br>
 Ok, see ya! Hold on, Ill storm with you!  Thank you for a lovely afternoon, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman! Laurie, were you cheating? You cant prove anything.
 <br>
 Oh, for gods sake! Ok.
 <br>
 Well, if you werent such a crappy card player then I wouldnt have had to cheat! And you were gonna lose all your mad money, and Midge bugs me.
 <br>
 You were cheating so I would win.
 <br>
 Duh! I wanted you to have a little fun.
 <br>
 Wellgosh, thats sweet.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I love you, mommy! I just know I wouldnt have missed him.
 <br>
 Not when he was that close.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Dad, you see the can by that clearing? Yeah!  I dont believe it.
 <br>
 Howd you do that? Dad.
 <br>
 I know how to shoot.
 <br>
 Dont you remember my taxi driver phase? Look, I didnt wanna kill him! I missed on purpose.
 <br>
 Well, I can respect that more than you being a crappy shot.
 <br>
 What? Why didnt you say so? Why do you think? You really think Ive been yelling at you for seventeen years? No.
 <br>
 You were probably ok with me as an infant, I just cant remember.
 <br>
 Boy, it was right around thirteen when you started getting a little lippy.
 <br>
 And twitchy.
 <br>
 Well, you know, lippy and twitchy tend to walk hand in hand, so Now thats lippy.
 <br>
 You got something you wanna say to me, you just say it.
 <br>
 Dad No, Im, Im serious.
 <br>
 Just for a second, pretend that Im not your dad.
 <br>
 I want you to tell me what you really think of me.
 <br>
 How bout lets do this when you dont have a gun? How bout you do what the guy with the gun tells you to do? Okay.
 <br>
 I think youre angry, because life didnt turn out exactly the way that you wanted it to.
 <br>
 And, uh, maybe you think if you yell at me, I wont let life push me around, too.
 <br>
 You came up with that answer awful fast.
 <br>
 Well.
 <br>
 Hell, Eric.
 <br>
 Maybe youll be ok.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Dad, hes back.
 <br>
 Oh, look at him, hes magnificent! Hes the king of the forest.
 <br>
 Just like Bambis dad.
 <br>
 Hes beautiful.
 <br>
 Yeah, and I bet he tastes beautiful, too.
 <br>
 Oh, uh, just for the record, Eric.
 <br>
 Im the king of the forest.
 <br>
 Way to go, dad.
 <br>
 You finally got your buck.
 <br>
 Wish it was mine! But somebody took my gun away cause he sensed what a great hunter I am! Kelso, if we let you keep your gun, Fezd be the one strapped to that hood right now.
 <br>
 Hey, Red! So, uh, about that accident, huh? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Well, it was a long time ago.
 <br>
 I was out, uh, hunting with Frank.
 <br>
 He was a good friend of mine.
 <br>
 A good guy.
 <br>
 Kind of a dumbass, like, uh, Kelso here.
 <br>
 So anyway, Frank shot this deer.
 <br>
 And he was real happy.
 <br>
 And hed had a few beers, so he was dancing around, and it was all real fun.
 <br>
 And then, he leans over to kiss the deer.
 <br>
 Only the deers not dead yet and it kicks him right in the neck! And it killed him.
 <br>
 The deer is staring at my soul.
 <br>
 Put some sunglasses on it! Well, this is just delicious! Sorry about the buckshot.
 <br>
 Oh, I dont mind.
 <br>
 I mean, theres usually some mystery gristle in meat and at least we know what it is.
 <br>
 I like it better when you fish, daddy.
 <br>
 It was jerking around, so, uh, Eric shot it with a shot gun.
 <br>
 Well, I had to.
 <br>
 It wasscreaming.
 <br>
 Killed a raccon once Hit him with my uncle&#39;s car so bad.
 <br>
 Allright, settle down killer.
 <br>
 Yeah, says like we&#39;re all a bunch of real killers.
 <br>
 Oh, good God crack the window Bloody some blessings
