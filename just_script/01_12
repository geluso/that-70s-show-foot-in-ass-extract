 Man, the Grinch has a big butt.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Nothing says Christmas like a big, green Grinch ass.
 <br>
 Hold the ladder for me.
 <br>
 So, Eric, what are you doing Christmas Eve? My parents are having the same, lame Christmas party they have every year.
 <br>
 All the adults: &#34;Neighbor, is that mistletoe?&#34; All right, how does that look? - It&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - Looks fabulous.
 <br>
 Guys, the ornaments are up here.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Looks great.
 <br>
 I just love Christmas.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all about good tidings and cheer.
 <br>
 And shopping.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what Jesus was going for.
 <br>
 I give, too.
 <br>
 Every year, my friends and I deliver gift baskets to the unfortunate.
 <br>
 I think you mean less fortunate.
 <br>
 Okay, whatever.
 <br>
 Bums.
 <br>
 What are you guys doing watching cartoons? Holiday Inn is on.
 <br>
 Where the treetops glisten La, la, la, listen Eric, come on, help me get the decorations.
 <br>
 Sure, Mom.
 <br>
 You know what my favorite Christmas gift of all time is? Lite Brite.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun making things with Lite Brite.
 <br>
 It is.
 <br>
 Man, my favorite gift is cash.
 <br>
 That way you can buy whatever you want.
 <br>
 Know what I mean, Donna? Like, let&#39;s just say somebody gave you $6 and some change, right? You know, to buy a present.
 <br>
 What would you get? Hyde, it doesn&#39;t matter how much a gift costs as long as it&#39;s personal and sentimental.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s both personal and sentimental? Diamonds.
 <br>
 We were going through a box of Christmas decorations and we found the Christmas rat.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! So Laurie, seeing anyone special at college? I like to date around.
 <br>
 Slut! Bless you.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 Dad, instead of being at your party this year I was thinking of throwing a party in the basement.
 <br>
 I mean, I think I&#39;m old enough.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Fine? Every year he just mopes around here like it&#39;s the end of the world, anyway.
 <br>
 All right! Thanks, Dad.
 <br>
 So now who&#39;s going to sing the high parts on The Little Drummer Boy? Traditionally it&#39;s the man who can&#39;t grow facial hair.
 <br>
 Dad, one more thing about the party.
 <br>
 I need some money.
 <br>
 All right, Eric.
 <br>
 I want you to pick out this year&#39;s tree.
 <br>
 And, whatever you don&#39;t spend you can use for your party.
 <br>
 You know how much I hate haggling with those tree Haggling is part of being an adult.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s $40.
 <br>
 - I want $50.
 <br>
 - Knock it off! Pick out a good one.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Throw your party.
 <br>
 But can I at least make you some punch and cookies? - Mom, no.
 <br>
 - Just punch? No, Mom.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t have a Christmas party without punch.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just insanity! Merry Christmas.
 <br>
 You know, Bob, I just want to thank you again for the job, you know? I always need extra help during the holidays.
 <br>
 I feel like you&#39;re my second-in-command around here.
 <br>
 So listen how about you close up for me on Christmas Eve? Why would we be open? It&#39;s a big night, Red.
 <br>
 See, picture a guy driving home from work on Christmas Eve.
 <br>
 Fa la la la la Bob, nobody works on Christmas Eve.
 <br>
 All of a sudden, he realizes he forgot to buy a gift! Then he passes by the store here, sees we&#39;re the only place open.
 <br>
 So what does he do? He comes in here and buys a fridge.
 <br>
 So this guy&#39;s insane? Not my place to judge.
 <br>
 - So what do you say? - Fine.
 <br>
 I knew I could count on you, Red.
 <br>
 Of course, you&#39;ll have to wear the Santa Claus suit.
 <br>
 You got me there, Bob.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious, Red.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You got me there, Bob.
 <br>
 Forman, man, would you relax? This is a good plan.
 <br>
 We cut down the tree, keep the $40 for beer.
 <br>
 Car.
 <br>
 Where? Kelso, &#34;car&#34; means get down.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 No, I disagree, Kelso.
 <br>
 See, if you were done the tree would probably be more horizontal.
 <br>
 No, I mean I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 Car! All right, cut it yourself.
 <br>
 Fine, Kelso.
 <br>
 Do you believe him? Hyde, did you have to write your name in the snow so close to the tree? Sorry.
 <br>
 Now we got $40 for beer.
 <br>
 You know what else we should do? Not get any presents.
 <br>
 No presents.
 <br>
 That way, we got more money for beer.
 <br>
 Shut up! Eric.
 <br>
 This is the most beautiful tree I think we have ever had.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s just It&#39;s so fresh.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Pinciotti? Look, I was thinking about getting a present for this girl.
 <br>
 And you know, she&#39;s about Donna&#39;s age so I was kinda wondering what Donna likes.
 <br>
 Perfume.
 <br>
 Donna wears White Shoulders.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not just for shoulders, you can wear it anywhere.
 <br>
 - Really? - Sure.
 <br>
 Like your neck, or the mall.
 <br>
 Wow! All right.
 <br>
 How much does a bottle of that run? About $12.
 <br>
 What about a bottle of crappy perfume? What does that run? Gosh, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll call Bob&#39;s mom.
 <br>
 You did not get this from a lot.
 <br>
 You stole it.
 <br>
 I haggled.
 <br>
 With who? Smokey the Bear? You stole it.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re one to talk.
 <br>
 You&#39;re flunking out of college.
 <br>
 - How&#39;d you know? - I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Shut up! - Shut up.
 <br>
 - You shut up! You shut up! - Okay.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, now be careful with this one.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s very, very old.
 <br>
 - It looks terrible.
 <br>
 Laurie, hang that one around on the back side.
 <br>
 Okay, Grandma.
 <br>
 You know, Kitty, you&#39;ve got two red ones together.
 <br>
 So I do.
 <br>
 Thank you, Bernice.
 <br>
 Eric, help me hang these stupid ornaments.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I&#39;m planning a party.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 How come the little drummer boy gets to have a party? Because I asked, you stupid sister.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not clever.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have time to be clever.
 <br>
 I&#39;m planning a party, Miss Dumb girl.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 Hi, is Michael here? There&#39;s no Michael here.
 <br>
 You have the wrong address.
 <br>
 Michael, I want you to drive me and my friends around on Christmas Eve.
 <br>
 Why? To distribute gift baskets to the less fortunate bums.
 <br>
 Okay, but we better be back in time for the party.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Perhaps you lovely ladies would like to join us? I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 We are supposed to be helping the less fortunate.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Jackie, come here.
 <br>
 Why? Just come here.
 <br>
 Hyde, if you want to make out with me, the answer&#39;s probably no.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 Look, Jackie I know this girl, right? - And I want to get her a Christmas present.
 <br>
 - My God, it&#39;s Donna! It&#39;s not Donna.
 <br>
 Okay, it&#39;s not Donna.
 <br>
 So how much do you have to spend? - $6.
 <br>
 - You don&#39;t deserve a girl like Donna for $6.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not trying to get Donna.
 <br>
 - Good, &#39;cause you won&#39;t, for $6.
 <br>
 You know what? Thanks a lot, never mind, bye-bye.
 <br>
 We will see you tomorrow, babes.
 <br>
 - May I ask you a question? - Sure.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing? What? Buying Donna a gift.
 <br>
 You know Eric likes her.
 <br>
 I know, man, but, you know, they&#39;re not officially Still, in my country, I would string you from the tallest tree.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not in your country, Fez.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 So good luck with Donna.
 <br>
 Remember, every day is Christmas at Bargain Bob&#39;s! We&#39;re back from the store.
 <br>
 Kitty, I made a few changes on your grocery list.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like your taste in dip.
 <br>
 No, Laurie.
 <br>
 No, that punch is for Eric&#39;s party.
 <br>
 Here, why don&#39;t you take this tonic out to the bar? Make sure we have enough rum and vodka.
 <br>
 All that rum and vodka.
 <br>
 Kitty, you have a problem.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s for the party, Bernice.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s convenient.
 <br>
 All I know is that my Red didn&#39;t start to drink until he met you.
 <br>
 And I didn&#39;t start to drink until I met you.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas.
 <br>
 Okay, Bernice, here, help me get more of the party supplies.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas.
 <br>
 Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.
 <br>
 This should probably go here.
 <br>
 Mistletoe? Yeah, it&#39;s really more for decoration.
 <br>
 - Is that a fact, neighbor? - No.
 <br>
 Here, Eric, where do we put the beer? Put it in the ice chest.
 <br>
 Okay, now, here you go.
 <br>
 Punch and cookies, just like I promised.
 <br>
 - No, Mom! Mom! - Eric, Mom made it for you.
 <br>
 The least you could do is drink a lot of it.
 <br>
 You know, you two you are just the best Christmas present a mother could have.
 <br>
 Hello, Laurie.
 <br>
 Kelso.
 <br>
 So Cool.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas.
 <br>
 Punch.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Can I pour you some? - No, thank you.
 <br>
 But if you would like you can bend over and put my gifts under the tree.
 <br>
 Gifts? No, I thought we said no gifts.
 <br>
 No, Kelso, you said no gifts.
 <br>
 What&#39;s Christmas without gifts? Yeah, man.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your heart? Nobody tells me anything around here! Now I gotta go get something for Jackie.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll kill me! Cheer up.
 <br>
 Have some punch.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want any punch.
 <br>
 I gotta get a gift for Jackie.
 <br>
 Who I&#39;m breaking up with.
 <br>
 Hi, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Kelso, what are you doing here? It&#39;s Christmas Eve.
 <br>
 I know, I&#39;m looking for a Christmas gift.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;re the only place in this whole town that&#39;s open.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 What can I get for $17? We&#39;ve got some really nice heavy-duty extension cords.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 How much is that refrigerator? Hello, ladies.
 <br>
 So glad you could make it.
 <br>
 May I get you something to drink? We have beer, you know.
 <br>
 - What else do you have? - We have punch, but we also have beer.
 <br>
 Punch is fine.
 <br>
 Punch it is.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Would you like to chase down that punch with a nice beer? I am kicking your ass! Good game, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 You&#39;re leaving? Come on, we&#39;ll play another game.
 <br>
 - No, Jackie&#39;s waiting for me.
 <br>
 I really - One more game, come on.
 <br>
 You know who you remind me of? Freddy Prinze.
 <br>
 No, Ricardo Mottleblonde.
 <br>
 You said, &#34;mottleblonde.
 <br>
 &#34; No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Okay, shut up.
 <br>
 Okay, Fez I want you to say something, like, really slow.
 <br>
 Hello, my darlings.
 <br>
 And when I say hello, you know what I mean.
 <br>
 He was my friend first.
 <br>
 Man, what&#39;s going on with the pep squad? Yeah, they seem extra stupid tonight.
 <br>
 Jackie, this is for you.
 <br>
 Michael, what is it? It&#39;s hot rollers! And with steam! Mele kalikimaka is the thing to say On a bright Hawaiian Christmas day Hiya, Red.
 <br>
 How&#39;d it go tonight? I sold a set of hot rollers, Bob.
 <br>
 And a pong game.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 - May I help you? - Ma&#39;am, do you own the 1969 tan Oldsmobile station wagon in the driveway? No, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Do you know who does? Yes, I do.
 <br>
 Could you get them, please? Sure.
 <br>
 Red! Sir, we believe your vehicle was involved in the unlawful removal of state property.
 <br>
 - What? - We&#39;re gonna have to confiscate that tree.
 <br>
 The tree? No, I mean, it&#39;s all done.
 <br>
 I mean, look at it.
 <br>
 No! I got you something.
 <br>
 It&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 But, you know, Christmas.
 <br>
 Suddenly Hyde&#39;s getting bashful? Oh, wow! This is great.
 <br>
 - What is it? - It&#39;s a picture of me and Hyde.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s me and you in fifth grade.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve had it in my drawer forever, so I just framed it.
 <br>
 That is so sweet.
 <br>
 Yeah, that is so sweet.
 <br>
 Look, why don&#39;t you open my present? White Shoulders.
 <br>
 I love this stuff.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 My God you can see my training bra through my shirt.
 <br>
 Yeah, I remember that training bra.
 <br>
 I wish I&#39;d - gotten you something like - Man.
 <br>
 Dude, it&#39;s nothing.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s not nothing.
 <br>
 - This is so thoughtful.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the sweetest thing anyone&#39;s ever given me.
 <br>
 Next to the perfume.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 I wrapped it myself.
 <br>
 I know how you like things wrapped.
 <br>
 Eric before you explain the beer maybe you can tell me why there are two state troopers in the living room confiscating our Christmas tree? That funny story, and a true story.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna laugh Get to the point! We cut the tree off the side of the interstate.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just great, Eric.
 <br>
 Now the party&#39;s over, you&#39;re grounded, and I want what&#39;s left of my $40.
 <br>
 Kelso, give it to him.
 <br>
 Oh, no! Yeah, I sort of spent it on Jackie&#39;s gift.
 <br>
 Michael, my hot rollers! You got in trouble for me, Michael? I love you, Michael! God bless us, everyone! And Hyde loves Donna.
 <br>
 She&#39;s crazy, man! Eric, what the hell is going on here? - Have these girls been drinking? - No.
 <br>
 Look, Dad, I swear.
 <br>
 Just Mom&#39;s punch.
 <br>
 Lousy with hooch! You see? You see, Red? She&#39;s drunk, man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s drunk talk.
 <br>
 False.
 <br>
 Come on, Jackie.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take you and the &#34;sob sisters&#34; home.
 <br>
 Eric, the rest of that beer goes in my refrigerator.
 <br>
 Donna, your father&#39;s upstairs.
 <br>
 I suggest you join him.
 <br>
 Steven, you help Eric clean up.
 <br>
 And Kelso go home! Eric, do something.
 <br>
 Your father&#39;s taking my women! Thanks for the gifts, guys.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas.
 <br>
 So what&#39;d you get? ID Bracelet.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 - Is your name on it? - Yeah.
 <br>
 What&#39;d you get? - Tube socks.
 <br>
 - Good! I mean, tube socks are good.
 <br>
 Thanks for working tonight.
 <br>
 Sorry it was a slow night.
 <br>
 - No problem.
 <br>
 - Merry Christmas, Red.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas, Bob.
 <br>
 Now give me a hug.
 <br>
 No, Bob.
 <br>
 Really, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s the &#39;70s.
 <br>
 Men can hug.
 <br>
 - No, Bob, they can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Come on, it&#39;s Christmas.
 <br>
 Look, mistletoe.
 <br>
