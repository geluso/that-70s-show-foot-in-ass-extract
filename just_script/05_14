<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Okay, let me get this straight.
 <br>
 After my grandpa&#39;s funeral, Kelso and Annette are making out.
 <br>
 Jackie sees them and yells, &#39;&#39;Get off my boyfriend&#39;&#39;? Right in front of you? Yeah, it brought the whole funeral way down.
 <br>
 Hyde, that&#39;s horrible, man.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s even worse? I totally missed it.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, nobody else missed it.
 <br>
 Half the frickin&#39; town was there.
 <br>
 Today at The Hub, you know that kid Jimmy with the headgear? He said he felt bad for me.
 <br>
 Jimmy Headgear felt bad for me! I knew it was a mistake hooking up with Jackie, and I did it anyway.
 <br>
 You know why? &#39;Cause she makes you stupid.
 <br>
 I bet Kelso was composing symphonies before her.
 <br>
 Hyde.
 <br>
 Man, I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause whatJackie did to you was embarrassing.
 <br>
 You must be so embarrassed.
 <br>
 I told a lot of people what happened and they all agreed that it was just really embarrassing.
 <br>
 Kelso, now is not the time.
 <br>
 I just wanna buck our boy up, &#39;cause what happened to him was so embarrassing! That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna kick your ass.
 <br>
 Whoa, whoa! Why don&#39;t we go upstairs.
 <br>
 We got that new JCPenney catalog.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a full-color section on bras.
 <br>
 Word has it the airbrush guy totally missed a nipple.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s so mad.
 <br>
 I was just being sensitive! Well, be sensitive to me because I&#39;m upset too.
 <br>
 If you expect me to go to the Valentine&#39;s dance tonight -you&#39;re gonna have to do a few things for me.
 <br>
 - For you or to you? Shut up! One: You will not speak toJackie.
 <br>
 Two: You will not speak to girls who have brown hair likeJackie.
 <br>
 Three: You will not speak toJackie.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 I got messed up.
 <br>
 Yeah, baby, whatever you want.
 <br>
 Just- Man, it&#39;s great being under someone&#39;s thumb again! What did your mother do to you? Man, I just feel bad for Hyde.
 <br>
 I mean, Annette wants me.
 <br>
 Jackie wants me.
 <br>
 My good looks are ruining people&#39;s lives.
 <br>
 Well, Hyde seems pretty mad.
 <br>
 Whatever, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not afraid of him.
 <br>
 - ( Eric ) He got away.
 <br>
 ! - Help me! So have you talked to Hyde about the whole &#39;&#39;get off my boyfriend&#39;&#39; disaster? No.
 <br>
 And why is everyone making such a big deal about it? Every time I walk into a room, people look at me funny.
 <br>
 Donna, how do you deal with it? Jackie, the reason people are making a big deal about it is because it sounds like you still have feelings for Kelso.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 I think the only reason I said it was because I was having an allergic reaction to the Forman&#39;s cheap generic soda.
 <br>
 ( High-pitched ) Oh, no! A giant redhead! Please don&#39;t crush me! Ple-e-ease! Fez, would you stop screwing around.
 <br>
 Now, did you finish the balloon walkway of love yet? You bet I did.
 <br>
 When Nina sees it, she&#39;s gonna be so impressed her balloons will become my walkway of love, if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 Fez, that&#39;s disgusting.
 <br>
 ( High-pitched ) Oh, no, the giant&#39;s angry! Run for your life! Run! Run! ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) - Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, this chili is great.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 Daddy used to love my chili.
 <br>
 Remember, Mom? I remember it gave him the toots.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a nice place to start reminiscing.
 <br>
 So, Eric, are you excited about your big Valentine&#39;s dance? Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s in the gym.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing like celebrating the most romantic night of your life in the room where I got my first wedgie.
 <br>
 It meant I liked you, Eric.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to talk about my father.
 <br>
 Well, Kitty, we can dwell on what was or we can talk about what is.
 <br>
 If I&#39;ve learned anything from losing my Burtie Bear it&#39;s that all that really matters is making sure that the people we love know we love them.
 <br>
 Mom, that was wonderful.
 <br>
 I mean it.
 <br>
 Eric, I love you.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, thanks, Grandma.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;ll go for a walk.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Well, this was fun.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go to bed for a few days.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 She hasn&#39;t done this since Elvis died on the crapper.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;ve gotta sit by her bed for four days and tell her that she&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hard to say that to a cold-cream-smeared loony in bunny slippers.
 <br>
 I remember that week.
 <br>
 The shades were drawn.
 <br>
 The food supply ran low.
 <br>
 We were sucking on bouillon cubes to stay alive.
 <br>
 Yeah, but did you hear what your grandma said about love being the only thing that matters? - Eric, we should tell her that we&#39;re engaged.
 <br>
 - What? She could be the one person who&#39;d be happy for us.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna need someone on our side when we tell our families.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And you know what? Even if she&#39;s not on our side the minute Grandma thinks it&#39;s a bad idea my mom will be booking the big room at the Holiday Inn just out of spite.
 <br>
 So, it&#39;s a win-win.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna do what Luke Skywalker was too afraid to do- use the Dark Side to our advantage.
 <br>
 Eric, if we&#39;re gonna be married, you really gotta ease up on the Star Wars stuff.
 <br>
 All right? It doesn&#39;t apply to everything.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to rewrite my vows.
 <br>
 - My favorite song? - Uh, &#39;&#39;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; The light I look best in? Uh, it&#39;s a tie between and mid-summer sunset.
 <br>
 Very good, Michael.
 <br>
 God, I missed this.
 <br>
 Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Have you guys seen Steven? I hear a weird, piercing noise, but I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s coming from.
 <br>
 - Do you hear anything, Michael? - Yeah, it&#39;s justJackie.
 <br>
 Uh,Jackie, I&#39;m sorry you have to see me in this T-shirt.
 <br>
 I know how it emphasizes my hunkalicious bod.
 <br>
 Shut up, Michael.
 <br>
 I made a stupid slip.
 <br>
 It meant nothing.
 <br>
 Right, because Michael is my boyfriend.
 <br>
 I know he is, skank wad.
 <br>
 - Oh, I&#39;m a skank wad? - Girl fight! Let&#39;s get it on! We are not gonna fight.
 <br>
 Well, maybe you should kiss and make up.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get it on! What? What? Wait.
 <br>
 Ah, I&#39;ll go with the blonde.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Kitty, I&#39;m just going to the corner to get you some soup.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not leaving you for somebody younger and less dramatic.
 <br>
 This is your fault.
 <br>
 If I wanna get my wife out of bed I gotta tie a rope around her and attach it to my bumper and pull her out like a stump.
 <br>
 So what were you saying, dear? Um, well, I was saying that I&#39;m getting married.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, how wonderful! So, who&#39;s the lucky girl? - Well, um, Donna.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I guess this is a small town.
 <br>
 Okay, what the hell did that mean? That, my friend, is the seldom heard but much feared Grandma burn.
 <br>
 Your only warning is the jingle of costume jewelry and the overpowering scent of BenGay.
 <br>
 Well, you and Jackie are certainly a mess.
 <br>
 I remember before Nina when my love life was a mess.
 <br>
 It&#39;s perfect now though.
 <br>
 Not like yours, which is a mess.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;ve called three times in the last half hour.
 <br>
 Figured it was you.
 <br>
 All the calls came during commercials in the Newlywed Game.
 <br>
 So, what? Now you&#39;re not taking my calls? Why are you making such a big deal about this? Because it is a big deal when you yell, &#39;&#39;Get off my boyfriend&#39;&#39; - to a girl who&#39;s on someone who&#39;s not me.
 <br>
 - ( Groans ) Steven, I cannot be held responsible for the things that come out of my mouth.
 <br>
 It didn&#39;t mean anything.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s your story? &#39;&#39;It didn&#39;t mean anything&#39;&#39;? Right.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 So, you just need to get over it.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m over you.
 <br>
 Steven, what are you saying? He&#39;s saying he&#39;s breaking up with you.
 <br>
 Are you not paying attention? Because I&#39;m on the edge of my freakin&#39; seat here.
 <br>
 Steven.
 <br>
 ( Door Opens, Closes ) So, I have a girlfriend and you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 So, my grandma doesn&#39;t think Donna&#39;s good enough for me.
 <br>
 How great is that? Finally, someone thinks Donna&#39;s the lucky one.
 <br>
 No more, &#39;&#39;Hey, how&#39;d he get her?&#39;&#39; Or, &#39;&#39;Oh, that skinny guy must really be rich.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I heard the whispers.
 <br>
 I just pretended not to.
 <br>
 Who was whispering? We said it right to you.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m done with Jackie, and I feel like a guy who had a 95-pound mole removed- a 95-pound, Donny Osmond loving shoe-shopping, Ice Capade attending mole.
 <br>
 Hyde, I know that&#39;s just coming from a place of deep, deep pain.
 <br>
 And I really do feel bad that my &#39;&#39;foxitude&#39;&#39; broke you and Jackie up.
 <br>
 And I&#39;d tone it down, but I just don&#39;t know how! Guys, I&#39;m worried there&#39;s some unfinished business between Michael and Jackie.
 <br>
 When they were together, did she make him happy? Well, she totally dominated him and made him feel bad about himself.
 <br>
 I guess what I&#39;m asking is, was she ever fat or anything? Eric, how can your grandmother not like me? Ooh! Maybe I should wear my Catholic school uniform around her more.
 <br>
 People like me in that.
 <br>
 Well, guys mostly.
 <br>
 But, hey, give it a shot.
 <br>
 Grandmas have secrets too.
 <br>
 Donna, Steven broke up with me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Hey, maybe he just wanted you to be able to spend more time with your other boyfriend.
 <br>
 ( Together) Shut up, Eric! Oh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t know they let slutballs in here.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve seen you in here, so I figured it was okay.
 <br>
 Oh, you don&#39;t know it, but you just burnt yourself.
 <br>
 Oh, I know it.
 <br>
 The question is, do you? I just said I do.
 <br>
 So do I, so you are too.
 <br>
 Donna, you following this? Um, I think one of&#39;em&#39;s a slutball and one of&#39;em knows it.
 <br>
 I think what we need to do is go talk about Michael.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll try to use small words so you can understand me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not gonna be good enough.
 <br>
 - Hey, Grandma.
 <br>
 - Good afternoon, Mrs.
 <br>
 Sigurdson.
 <br>
 Nice day, huh? No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s raining, and my arthritis is kicking up.
 <br>
 What a coincidence.
 <br>
 Mine too.
 <br>
 Boy, am I getting old.
 <br>
 Not too old, you know.
 <br>
 Whatever you are.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Hey, Grandma, Donna brought you some salsa.
 <br>
 Yep, Donna makes the best darn salsa outside of your beloved Arizona.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a reflection of her long-time love affair with the Southwest.
 <br>
 Much like your own.
 <br>
 Go, Grand Canyon! So, Eric, who are you seeing these days? Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, Grandma, you have got to give Donna a chance.
 <br>
 And I know you two will get along famously.
 <br>
 You have so much in common.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Like I love eating dinner at 4:30 too.
 <br>
 Look, Miss Sigurdson, I love Eric with all my heart.
 <br>
 And I know that when you give me a chance, you&#39;ll see that we&#39;re great together.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s very sweet.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure you&#39;re the nicest girl Eric&#39;s met so far.
 <br>
 She is just so good at that.
 <br>
 See? Isn&#39;t it better to be up and about than stuck in your bed for a week? Well, this is better.
 <br>
 Why did I let that woman get to me? I&#39;m gonna get out of this robe.
 <br>
 And take a shower.
 <br>
 I mean, that&#39;s the spirit! Your mother is a nutbag! What did she do? That thing where she pretends to be nice, but she&#39;s really insulting you.
 <br>
 - Yes! - Frigid witch! I&#39;ll get the bed ready.
 <br>
 How could she not like me? How can she not like me? You know what? Maybe she just can&#39;t handle strong, healthy women.
 <br>
 And I am strong and healthy.
 <br>
 ( Quoting Lyric ) - ( Quoting Ends ) - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Well, I am not giving up on her.
 <br>
 - Oh, why are you worried? I&#39;m the one who has to live the rest of my life in the same family with this woman.
 <br>
 Yeah, but so do I.
 <br>
 In the sense that, um we&#39;re all part of the human family.
 <br>
 Steven, I have to tell you something.
 <br>
 Well, if it&#39;s &#39;&#39;get off my boyfriend,&#39;&#39; don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I already heard it.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I have to tell you, you were right.
 <br>
 When I said that, it did mean something.
 <br>
 And I thought it didn&#39;t, because sometimes I just want things because other people have them.
 <br>
 Like once, I made my dad buy me a pet rat because my cousin had one.
 <br>
 But then the rat got so disgusting, I made my kitty cat hunt it.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 - Who&#39;s the rat? Am I the rat? - No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Steven- Look.
 <br>
 Okay, I spoke to Annette.
 <br>
 And she made me realize that, okay maybe I do have some leftover feelings for Michael.
 <br>
 And then she said that if I wanted him, I&#39;d have to fight for him.
 <br>
 But, Steven, I know in my heart the only person I wanna fight for is you.
 <br>
 Really? Oh, boy! You like Kelso, but you like me a little bit more? What a bunch of crap! You know what I think,Jackie? I think the only reason you&#39;re with me in the first place was to get back at Kelso.
 <br>
 Steven, how can you say that? Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Maybe I do have feelings for Michael.
 <br>
 But what am I supposed to do? He was my first boyfriend.
 <br>
 And you know what? You&#39;re gonna have to learn to deal with it.
 <br>
 And if you can&#39;t and you&#39;re gonna have to break up with me because of that then I can&#39;t stop you, but I think it&#39;s a real waste, because I love you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not saying it back! I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Damn it! ( Sighs ) So, are we gonna go to the dance or what? Oh, Steven.
 <br>
 Well, it looks like I&#39;m just in time for makeup sex.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t mind me.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll barely hear me.
 <br>
 If you prefer, I can hide in the shower.
 <br>
 - Fez, get out of here.
 <br>
 - Okay, here I go.
 <br>
 ( P.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 : Disco ) Earlier today I mentioned that I would like your balloons to be my walkway of love.
 <br>
 And you said, &#39;&#39;Okay.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Do you know what I meant? Because I don&#39;t want to surprise you with this one.
 <br>
 Well, I think you meant- That&#39;s it! - Hey, look who&#39;s back together.
 <br>
 - What the hell! Come on,Jackie.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s dance.
 <br>
 How can she be with him when she&#39;s so clearly not over me? I think the question is, how can you be with me when you&#39;re so clearly not over her? What, is this a riddle? Start over.
 <br>
 You&#39;re obviously still in love with Jackie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m goin&#39; back to California.
 <br>
 Baby, no! I&#39;ll prove that I&#39;m over her.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll bet you 50 bucks that if we do it, I&#39;ll be into it.
 <br>
 Good-bye, Michael.
 <br>
 But you win either way! Oh, I feel so much better.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) I am a strong, healthy woman who doesn&#39;t need to go to bed every time some mean, old lady gives her a cross look.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 - Good evening, Mother.
 <br>
 - Going out to dinner.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Is that what you&#39;re wearing? I&#39;ll be in bed.
 <br>
 <br>
