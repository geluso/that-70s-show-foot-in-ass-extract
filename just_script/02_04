<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So, look at us.
 <br>
 This is just like a Norman Rockwell painting.
 <br>
 Mom is serving breakfast, daddy is reading the newspaper and brother Eric is trying to hide a big purple nasty hickey! Hickey? I don&#39;t have a hickey You know Eric, hickeys lead to dirty things For God &#39;s sakes, don&#39;t let Donna suck your neck.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a nice girl.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have a hickey! I was using a curling iron.
 <br>
 Oh well, will you just look at that? NO! Mom! Red, remember that time.
 <br>
 No and neither do you! Okay! Hahaha.
 <br>
 So, uhm Laurie, what&#39;s on the agenda today? Agenda? A list of goals or actions one might feel good about achieving so as to Eric, you tell her.
 <br>
 Mom, come on, relax, I&#39;m still getting used to being back home.
 <br>
 Yea, flunkin&#39; out of college can be draining *phew* Eric! Come on, that was so mild! Laurie all you do is sit around the house and watch television you should come down to the hospital and volunteer.
 <br>
 She&#39;s right Laurie! Daddy ! You know, I think Eric needs an agenda.
 <br>
 Look at his neck! It&#39;s a birthmark! It&#39;s been there since birth! Goodmorning class.
 <br>
 Good morning, orphan.
 <br>
 Goodmorning That&#39;s all you got? Whore! Mom, he called me a whore! Yeah.
 <br>
 Stephen, honey, you&#39;re too young for coffee, have some juice.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Foreman, I need coffee.
 <br>
 Your son kept me up all night bragging about his hickey.
 <br>
 Okay, whatever you do Eric, do NOT wear turtlenecks to school okay, that&#39;s a dead giveaway.
 <br>
 Yea, I&#39;d put on a decorative scarf.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Do you have to tell everyone about the hickey? Well, everyone can kinda see it, Vampirette.
 <br>
 Laurie had a field day at breakfast.
 <br>
 Yeah, I hopped on that dog pile too.
 <br>
 You sure did, you dillhole.
 <br>
 All right Foreman, that was sort of mean.
 <br>
 Probably what I should have said is: I&#39;m sick of sharing a room with you and all of your disgusting fluids and gasses.
 <br>
 Oh, and yours are just dreamy Hyde.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 May I please have a hickey please? - No.
 <br>
 - Please? - No! - Jackie ? - No! - Please ? No! So, the two of you do things to please your man.
 <br>
 Well Fez is a man, why do you not please him? Why? Why ? Jackie! Just give him a hickey.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going home.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve gotta go shopping with my mom, suddenly it&#39;s like really important we&#39;re being best friends.
 <br>
 What happened? She&#39;s been reading.
 <br>
 Reading Dammit, when will they learn? Finally! I thought that Jackie would never leave! Okay Kelso, what are you doing? Ah, I need a sexy memento from Laurie.
 <br>
 I gotta commemorate our forbidden love.
 <br>
 With panties! Fine! Just take your panties and go home.
 <br>
 Man! Those are my moms! Okay Foreman look man, I&#39;m not telling you how to live your life, but if someone touched MY moms panties, pf Hyde, didn&#39;t everyone touch your moms panties? Man, that was a burn! Okay, Foreman, I have a solution to this whole you-being-a-pain-in-my-ass-we-shareing-a-room-thing.
 <br>
 You move out.
 <br>
 - Of my room? - Yea.
 <br>
 Well that&#39;s just not gonna happen.
 <br>
 Hey fine, I move out of it, you big baby.
 <br>
 Still friends? I need time to heal.
 <br>
 Okay, these are Laurie&#39;s right? Kelso, what exactly are you gonna do with those panties? Just.
 <br>
 look at &#39;m Kelso, did you ever notice that Laurie and Eric have the same eyes? So if you&#39;re doing it with Laurie and she&#39;s perhaps wearing a hat it&#39;s kinda like you&#39;re doing it with Eric too! So.
 <br>
 Here we are.
 <br>
 Together.
 <br>
 Again.
 <br>
 Yea, I&#39;m just loving the time we spend together Donna.
 <br>
 In my new book &#39;Our Mothers, Our Selves&#39; it says we&#39;re supposed to be friends.
 <br>
 We should talk to each other, and listen.
 <br>
 You&#39;re stupid father never listens.
 <br>
 Is there anything in your book about not insulting my father? Well I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve only read the first chapter.
 <br>
 Oh, okay, no more talking about your father.
 <br>
 So, how do you like the clogs I bought you? They&#39;re awesome! Good! Cause your father&#39;s an ass ! Kelso took your underwear.
 <br>
 - Uhh that&#39;s like the third pair! -  Urgh.
 <br>
 Gimme the remote control! Gimme a reason why I shouldn&#39;t set you on fire! All right Laurie, take your best shot! Oh Red, we talked about this, let him go! Hello Laurie, I apologize for coming unannounced, but I .
 <br>
 Mum, daddy ! This is professor Stark, he was my art history teacher! Well actually I was your psychology teacher.
 <br>
 Whatever you taught her, she flunked it! Eric! So, you&#39;re from the university of Wisconsin.
 <br>
 Are you here to give me back my money? Well actually I came here because of Laurie Oh yes, he came to see if the university would take me back! Really? Oh please, here, have a seat! I&#39;ll make coffee, and cake, I&#39;ll make coffeecake and coffee! Hahaha! Oh gosh really, can you get her back into the university and out of my house? Hahaha Well, I&#39;m going to try my darndest! Well this is really good news! One of the best things I&#39;ve ever heard.
 <br>
 Yes it is.
 <br>
 I want to get Laurie back in school.
 <br>
 Professor, question, how lame exactly is your student body if you&#39;re trying to get this dumb cow ba.
 <br>

 <br>
 Oh, and I believe these paint chips are yours.
 <br>
 Well, these are, are the colour of our front door, aren&#39;t they? Yeah, you had a paint chip hanging from your front door so I .
 <br>

 <br>
 I started to peel it and I guess I got a little over zealouse Uhmmm psychology huh? Yes yes, human ?? fascinate me Hey dad.
 <br>
 Where have you two been? Mom bought me these clogs aren&#39;t they great? Oh.
 <br>
 She bought you clogs.
 <br>

 <br>
 So officially, I bought you clogs.
 <br>
 No Bob, I bought her the clogs.
 <br>
 Get in the car Donna! I&#39;m gonna buy you something.
 <br>
 Actually Dad, I&#39;ve got homework and.
 <br>
 Do you love your daddy? Yes.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Looks like you&#39;re going shopping with the big ASS.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 Eric I need you to go to the store and get me three pounds of ground beef, lean Mom, look, before you go into twenty cents a gram ground beef, this guy is not going to get Laurie back in college, shes stupid and evil.
 <br>
 Mostly stupid.
 <br>
 Eric she is not stupid.
 <br>
 Shes justshe has.
 <br>
 special.
 <br>
 Just go! Hyde! Oh, honey, just share the room with Eric.
 <br>
 No, thank you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Busted! No way! Yep, Laurie and her professor, tongueing in the garage like hungry dogs.
 <br>
 It was really disgusting.
 <br>
 No! No, you see because Laurie wouldnt just make out with some old guy.
 <br>
 She wouldnt do that.
 <br>
 No, its true man.
 <br>
 I was in the upstairs closet trying out my cot, and I saw them.
 <br>
 It was like live porno.
 <br>
 But not good porno which is like really really old.
 <br>
 It was like, old bad porno.
 <br>
 Michael, why do you care if Laurie kisses the professor? Yea Kelso, why do you care? Well.
 <br>
 because.
 <br>
 You see its wrong for an old person to make out with an innocent young student.
 <br>
 God, youre nobel.
 <br>
 Innocent?! Okay, Eric no offence, but your sister is as slutty as they come.
 <br>
 Eric are you gonna let her say that about your sister? Sure.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman, did you realise that theres a room back here man? And it barely stinks! PERFECT! You can sit right back beneath your bare bulb writing angry letters to the government Oh dont think I wont ! You see whats beautiful here people? I finally have somtehing on Laurie.
 <br>
 I own her, oh yeah! She is so screwed! All right, just be nice.
 <br>
 Look! Did everyone see my hickey? Somebody loves me.
 <br>
 Moron, you gave that to yourself.
 <br>
 Its still wet.
 <br>
 Oh no I did not! Somebody loves me.
 <br>
 There is a lady love.
 <br>
 There is ! So, you like the shirt I bought ya? Its very nice I wasnt sure because you didnt put it on in the store, like you did with the clogs.
 <br>
 I knew it.
 <br>
 You hate the shirt! Nice digs huh! Its perfect.
 <br>
 This is where we put all our old crap we just cant throw away.
 <br>
 Like you.
 <br>
 Forman, is it just me, or do your mum and dad like me a whole lot better then they like you? You see I kid, butyou hurt Boys! Dinner! All right man, you ready to make Laurie sqeal like the family pig? Ohhhhh.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna punk out, aren&#39;t you? Well it is my nature.
 <br>
 Look Forman, you&#39;ve always been the run for the litter.
 <br>
 This is your chance to bite the big dog on the ass.
 <br>
 So my advice to you is, bite the big dog on the ass! Okay, what if I let her of with a warning, you know, just this one time.
 <br>
 Well that would be the mature choice But not EVIL! You gotta think EVIL man! Where would we be without the A-bomb? - Actually the world was all that won but - Shut up! Now listen, lets review.
 <br>
 Daddy, Eric has dirty magazines under his bed.
 <br>
 Daddy, Eric snuck out last night.
 <br>
 Daddy, I saw Eric drinking all your beer.
 <br>
 Daddy, Eric made it hard for me to concentrate so I flunked out of college.
 <br>
 Daddy, Eric used all my handlotion Okay that bitch is dead! So, this news of Laurie leaving is just a little ray of sunshine! Hahaha! Well I just wished that more teachers cared about their students like you do.
 <br>
 I think it all started going downhill when you couldn&#39;t paddle the kids anymore.
 <br>
 Hehehe.
 <br>
 Pansy-ass supreme court.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Hey Forman, he who hesitates is boned.
 <br>
 Laurie is one of the most gifted women in my class.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve always enjoyed having her.
 <br>
 I own you.
 <br>
 Is there something wrong with the bread? No.
 <br>
 Why? O, Laurie.
 <br>
 I know something that you don&#39;t know that I know.
 <br>
 You know.
 <br>
 Yes yes.
 <br>
 Tell us Forman, so that we can all know.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know anything.
 <br>
 And if you do know something, I will make you sorry you were ever born! Well for your information, I&#39;m already sorry I was ever born! Eric! See! So, what does she need to do to get back into school? Well, she&#39;ll have to work with me.
 <br>
 Make a commitment.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 to school.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll really have to buckle down.
 <br>
 Hahahaha! Well what do you think Laurie, are you willing to give it a go? Oh, huhuh, mother she&#39;s very willing.
 <br>
 You know dad, I just saw the most interesting thing today.
 <br>
 In the garage.
 <br>
 Burst into flames, burst into flames, BURST INTO FLAMES! It was justit was so surprising.
 <br>
 Oh Eric, do tell! I saw Laurie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m love with your daughter! Dad! That&#39;s it! Come here!! Did you two have fun? A blast.
 <br>
 Donna, that shirt your father bought you makes you look so fat.
 <br>
 Yeah well, those clogs make you look like a duck.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? Both you guys really need to shut up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sick of hearing you fight.
 <br>
 Do you even know what you are fighting about? Oh, I know she started it! I only got mad cause I knew you were gonna get mad.
 <br>
 Allright okay, you know what WHATEVER, just no more fighting with eachother through me.
 <br>
 Got it? Although I would like you to continue buying me things, I mean, thank you! She likes the shirt better You&#39;re an ass Bob! Oeh, good comeback! Mister Forman, I really wanna get Laurie back in school! Oh for Gods sake Laurie, the man is in love with you and you still couldn&#39;t pass! So ? So I guess I disappointed you Daddy I&#39;m really sorry, I just wish he wouldn&#39;t have taken advantage of me and my love for education.
 <br>
 Huh that is just so ??? Well, I guess you&#39;re not the first student to be taken advantage of by a teacher.
 <br>
 O, wait, where are you going Dad? Just try not to be too hard on yourself.
 <br>
 No! Nooo! NOOOO! And the really sad thing is, Eric saw him kiss me today.
 <br>
 And he didn&#39;t even TRY to stop him! Cause she wanted it! You knew about this and you didn&#39;t do anything?! She&#39;s your sister! Yea Eric, why?! I&#39;ll deal with you later Eric! Come on Laurie, I&#39;ll make you a cup of coffee and explain to you the nature of men.
 <br>
 Something I thought you already knew but apparantly you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, I forgive you.
 <br>
 Well this is unforgivable.
 <br>
 In fact you SUCK! I&#39;ll be in my room Oh, mom.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, mom I had her in my sights! I mean she was right in the cross there! O honey, you know I love you and your sister equally, but if you ever get an opportunity again, for Gods sake pull the trigger! I&#39;m gonna tell you something Laurie.
 <br>
 If you slept with that professor, it&#39;s over between you and me.
 <br>
 Kelso, I slept with him a thousand times.
 <br>
 Why must you hurt me ? Shut up! Hey, hey, get out, get out! I hate you both! Go home, Fez!
