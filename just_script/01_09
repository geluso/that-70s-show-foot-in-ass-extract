 Laurie&#39;s bus isn&#39;t here yet.
 <br>
 Can we get in the car and turn on the heat? I&#39;m freezing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not wasting gas just so you can be comfortable.
 <br>
 Can we at least go wait inside? I&#39;m not going in that bus station with those people.
 <br>
 God, I&#39;m freezing.
 <br>
 I forgot to tell you, your sister&#39;s bringing a friend home so you&#39;ll be sleeping in the basement.
 <br>
 The basement? They should sleep in Laurie&#39;s room.
 <br>
 And Red, I&#39;ve been thinking.
 <br>
 Maybe this Thanksgiving we should skip the big turkey.
 <br>
 Small ones are on sale at Piggly Wiggly.
 <br>
 This family doesn&#39;t scrimp on holidays.
 <br>
 Can you imagine my mother sitting down to a chicken? Red, your mother won&#39;t eat my cooking anyway so that won&#39;t be a problem.
 <br>
 Dad, they should sleep in the basement.
 <br>
 Red, last Thanksgiving she said her jaw wasn&#39;t strong enough to chew the turkey.
 <br>
 And that was a magnificent turkey.
 <br>
 Dad, it&#39;s my room.
 <br>
 - I work myself to the bone for that - All right, that&#39;s it! Hold it.
 <br>
 Now, Kitty, don&#39;t get worked up over my mother.
 <br>
 And you, you&#39;re sleeping in the basement! And we&#39;re all having a happy damn Thanksgiving! Mommy, Daddy.
 <br>
 This is Kate.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Hi, sweetheart.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get in the car, you must be freezing.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re Eric.
 <br>
 Your sister didn&#39;t tell me you were so cute.
 <br>
 We are going to have so much fun this weekend.
 <br>
 You can sleep in my room.
 <br>
 Get Kate settled into your room.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, and don&#39;t forget to show her your GI Joe dolls.
 <br>
 That&#39;s such a good idea.
 <br>
 That&#39;ll give you a chance to tell Dad about that professor you&#39;re dating.
 <br>
 - What? - Dad, he&#39;s joking.
 <br>
 Gosh, I hope it doesn&#39;t get too cold tonight.
 <br>
 I sleep practically naked.
 <br>
 So, Kitty, looking forward to Thanksgiving? Yes.
 <br>
 Red&#39;s mother is coming.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that pet name she has for you? Whore.
 <br>
 You know, she doesn&#39;t bother me as much as she does Red and he&#39;s tense enough, what with Christmas coming up and him only working part-time.
 <br>
 Part-time, that&#39;s rough.
 <br>
 When Bob gets tense, we take a bubble bath together.
 <br>
 Soaking my naked body really relaxes him.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 - Mom, Grandma&#39;s on the phone! - I gotta go.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! So this Kate, is she hot? Of course she&#39;s hot.

 That&#39;s good, because they just opened up that big philosophy factory in Green Bay.
 <br>

 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Now, sweep the garage.
 <br>
 Yes, sir.
 <br>
 I wonder if the Pilgrims were clever enough to put peanut butter on their celery.
 <br>
 Kitty, could you get that? I&#39;m fixing the drawer.
 <br>
 Oh, dear God.
 <br>
 Your mother has already called me five times this morning.
 <br>
 - You answer it.
 <br>
 - Kitty, I don&#39;t want to talk to her.
 <br>
 She gave birth to you.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Hi, Ma.
 <br>
 Really? It&#39;s for you.
 <br>
 Hello, Mother Forman.
 <br>

 <br>
 Yep, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I need to work on my attitude.
 <br>
 Bye then.
 <br>
 You know I could have married Bill Bower.
 <br>
 His mother was dead.
 <br>
 What if he yells at me? He&#39;s not gonna yell at you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re doing him a favor.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 Red, what a surprise to run into you.
 <br>
 I live here, Bob.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m going in.
 <br>
 Actually, Red, I just wanted to ask you a favor.
 <br>
 My appliance store gets real busy over the holidays and I could use a little help down there.
 <br>
 You offering me a job? Now I don&#39;t want you to get the wrong idea.
 <br>
 This is not charity.
 <br>
 - Charity? - No, not charity.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not looking for work anyway, Bob.
 <br>
 But Goodnight, Bob! Midge, he yelled at me! Come in.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 What? I was just coming up here to get something to sleep in.
 <br>
 So I guess I&#39;ll see you later then.

 You can stay and talk a minute, if you want.

 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 And good night.
 <br>
 Good morning, Red.
 <br>
 Happy Thanksgiving.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You&#39;re up awful early.
 <br>
 Luckily I heard the phone ring when your mother called at 5:00 this morning.
 <br>
 Yeah, that is lucky.
 <br>
 Before I forget Laurie told me what she wants for Christmas.
 <br>
 A portable TV for her dorm room.
 <br>
 I&#39;m working part-time, she wants a TV.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Maybe Bob can get you a good deal on one from his store.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need any help from that damn Bob.
 <br>
 You know what he did yesterday? - He offered me a job.
 <br>
 - He did? We have to move away from such an evil man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a lot of fun in the morning.
 <br>
 Hey, turkey boy.
 <br>
 Wanna show me your giblets? So you made out with a college girl? Kind of.
 <br>
 Start talking.
 <br>
 Tell it like a story, like a sexy story.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 She, like, jammed her entire tongue into my mouth.
 <br>
 And you wouldn&#39;t think a girl had, like, that much tongue, you know? That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 What? I don&#39;t know, I feel kind of guilty.
 <br>
 Almost like dirty.
 <br>
 Dirty is good.
 <br>
 I like feeling dirty.
 <br>
 No, I mean, I feel bad.
 <br>
 Look, I think I gotta tell Donna.
 <br>
 Really? On behalf of men everywhere.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, I mean the right thing to do is juggle them both until it all blows up in your face.
 <br>
 Look, you guys don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t hide anything.
 <br>
 The minute she looks at me she&#39;s gonna know.
 <br>
 What are you guys talking about? I kissed a girl.
 <br>
 Shocking! I am appalled! You what? You know that friend my sister brought home from college? - The slutty one.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I kissed her.
 <br>
 - Why are you telling me this? - I feel guilty because it was like really kissing.
 <br>
 So what we do isn&#39;t really kissing? I thought you should know, considering that you and I have a thing.
 <br>
 Right? Obviously we don&#39;t have a thing if you&#39;re running around kissing slutty girls, right? Okay, you&#39;re mad.
 <br>
 Mad? No.
 <br>
 Why should I be mad? I mean, in fact, you can kiss whatever you want.
 <br>
 Start with your own butt! Why are you here? Why are you always here? It&#39;s Thanksgiving.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you have families? Donna, you wanna talk? - I guess Donna didn&#39;t take it very well.
 <br>
 - Take what well? Eric made out with Kate.
 <br>
 Anything else? Your son is a whore.
 <br>
 Eric Donna just came through here looking very upset.
 <br>
 Would you have any idea what that&#39;s about? I have no idea.
 <br>
 She seemed fine when we - You already know, don&#39;t you? - Of course I know.
 <br>
 Donna is such a sweet kid.
 <br>
 How could you do this to her? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 You know, it seems like bad things are always happening to me like I have bad luck or something.
 <br>
 Son, you don&#39;t have bad luck.
 <br>
 The reason that bad things happen to you is because you&#39;re a dumbass.
 <br>
 Now fix it.
 <br>
 Look, Donna can we talk? - I&#39;ll leave you two - No.
 <br>
 You should stay.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t have secrets in our house.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t sneak around on each other like a little horny rat kissing other girls.
 <br>
 Look, Donna please come to my house for Thanksgiving dessert.
 <br>
 Everyone&#39;s gonna be there.
 <br>
 You always come.
 <br>
 Please don&#39;t let some stupid thing that I did wreck that.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t depend on you so why should you be able to depend on me? Look Donna, please, okay? I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 - And I feel really bad.
 <br>
 - Good! - Poor thing.
 <br>
 - Mom! You.
 <br>
 Of course I meant you.
 <br>
 As a food editor, I wanted to find out for myself just what makes the modern turkey so good.
 <br>
 Amen.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s eat.
 <br>
 Now, is everything on the table? I still feel like I forgot something.
 <br>
 My God, I forgot your mother.
 <br>
 No! Hello, Mother Forman.
 <br>
 No, I didn&#39;t forget you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, the kids left a half hour ago to pick you up.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t imagine what&#39;s keeping them.
 <br>
 Put that back.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 The Toyota is blocking the car, I need the keys.
 <br>
 Could you hold on one teeny tiny second? For the love of God, move! Are you sure they&#39;re not there? Look out your window.
 <br>
 Now do you have your glasses on? Where&#39;s your grandma? She&#39;s not coming.
 <br>
 She said she&#39;s going to Cousin Joel&#39;s for Thanksgiving.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not so bad.
 <br>
 Actually, she said it was a shame she couldn&#39;t spend what might be her last Thanksgiving with her family.
 <br>
 But she does hope we all enjoy ourselves.
 <br>
 You know what? That&#39;s just fine.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need to kiss some old lady&#39;s A-S-S on my holiday.
 <br>
 You heard what I spelled.
 <br>
 Forget it.
 <br>
 So you give an employees&#39; discount down there at your store? Twenty percent.
 <br>
 Does that cover, anything like, say portable TVs? Heck, yeah.
 <br>
 Congratulations, Bob, you just hired me.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad to hear it, Red.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;ll have to call me Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti at work.
 <br>
 I got you good that time.
 <br>
 Donna, I am so glad you came.
 <br>
 I only came because my mom made me, okay? Donna, all right, good to see you.
 <br>
 I got you some pie.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want any stupid pie.
 <br>
 What? I didn&#39;t kiss her.
 <br>
 Hey, there, Bob.
 <br>
 You wanna piece of pie? Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t get all tough with me! - Yeah? Yeah! Okay.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Look, we need to talk.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll start.
 <br>
 Get out! What do you want me to say? I already apologized.
 <br>
 You just want to forget about us because I kissed some girl? Why&#39;d you do it? I have it on pretty good authority that I&#39;m a dumbass.
 <br>
 So you liked it? Yeah, I liked it.
 <br>
 &#34;No&#34; would have been a better answer.
 <br>
 Donna look that kiss was great and if I could take it back, I would.
 <br>
 Because it&#39;s not worth ruining what you and I have.
 <br>
 Eric, you are a dumbass.
 <br>
 So is that like &#34;I forgive you, dumb ass&#34; or &#34;Get out of my house, you dumb ass&#34;? Mostly the first one.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Tongue.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s go to dessert.
 <br>
 Just one second? Donna? Just one minute.
 <br>
 Silk sheets.
 <br>
 Joe Namath&#39;s butt.
 <br>
 Strawberries.
 <br>
 Slow dancing.
 <br>
 The washing machine with an unbalanced load.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 You haven&#39;t told anybody else about last night, have you? I mean, it&#39;s kind of embarrassing.
 <br>
 I mean for me.
 <br>
 Not you.
 <br>
 No, Kate, that&#39;s our little secret.
 <br>
 So, Kate, you and Eric? Like The Graduate, older woman, younger man.
 <br>
 You know, if breaking up couples is your thing you can do your thing with me &#39;cause Michael! Hello, Kate.
 <br>
 May I see your giant tongue?
