 ( TV: Crowd Cheering ) Hey, hey.
 <br>
 Do you guys hear that? That was me.
 <br>
 I had hot dogs for lunch.
 <br>
 Not that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m talking about the sweet sound of no women.
 <br>
 - ( Buzzer Sounds ) - I never hear that.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s voice is burned into my brain.
 <br>
 I wish it would stop, but it won&#39;t.
 <br>
 Remember back in the day when it was just us guys? That was good times.
 <br>
 More like desperate, &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t care if she has a mustache I&#39;ll take her anyway&#39;&#39; times.
 <br>
 You know what? I say, who needs women? Come on! Let&#39;s get crazy.
 <br>
 What was that? Did someone say mini golf? I&#39;m still not allowed back in there.
 <br>
 I mean, what&#39;s the point of having a windmill you can&#39;t ride? We could go beer bowling.
 <br>
 That&#39;s always fun.
 <br>
 I am in, because beer makes you a better bowler.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a proven fact.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Do I have to use the pink ladies&#39; ball again? Now, Fez, why do you ask that question when you already know the answer? Pink ball only until I lose my virginity.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Them&#39;s the rules.
 <br>
 All right, fellas.
 <br>
 You know the rules.
 <br>
 You get a strike, you chug.
 <br>
 You get a gutter ball, you chug.
 <br>
 You get a 7-1 0 split seven to 1 0 chugs.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, look.
 <br>
 I got 1 0-pound balls.
 <br>
 Man, that joke never gets old.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, my balls have holes in them.
 <br>
 Now, why isn&#39;t that funny? This is livin&#39;.
 <br>
 A little bowling, a lot of beer, and just us guys.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Man, bowling-alley chicks are easy.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Jill.
 <br>
 Glad you could make it.
 <br>
 Guys, this is Jill, the girl I told you about.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re the one that hasn&#39;t put out yet.
 <br>
 Ay! Nice to meet you.
 <br>
 You too.
 <br>
 So, who&#39;s up first? - Me.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) Can I be next? Hey, buddy? Hyde? Buddy? Can I talk to you for a second, buddy? Hyde, what&#39;s goin&#39; on? I thought this was supposed to be guys&#39; night.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry about it, man.
 <br>
 She&#39;s-She&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 She&#39;s like one of us.
 <br>
 In three beers, she&#39;ll be belchin&#39; like a Kennedy.
 <br>
 This is &#39;&#39;guys&#39; night only,&#39;&#39; man.
 <br>
 Yeah, I say out with the whore.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;ll buy the next round of beer.
 <br>
 The whore stays.
 <br>
 Okay, good night, you two.
 <br>
 Boy, thatJoanne- She&#39;s somethin&#39;, huh? - Yeah, she&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 I like her.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 Not that I&#39;m ready to jump into anything.
 <br>
 I hate jumping.
 <br>
 Makes me jiggle.
 <br>
 But I won&#39;t like her if it bothers you &#39;cause I know you&#39;ve had a tough time since your mom left.
 <br>
 No, Dad, I think it&#39;s nice that you have a friend.
 <br>
 - Really? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I also think it&#39;s nice that you&#39;re bathing and shaving again.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That was a long eight weeks, wasn&#39;t it? So long.
 <br>
 Boy, Kitty, you missed a great game.
 <br>
 The Bucks made a last-second shot and sent those Lakers home with their tails between their California fruitcake asses! Go home, fruitcakes! I&#39;ve never seen old Pastor Dave so excited.
 <br>
 He swore at the referee.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Son of a stitch.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I said, &#39;&#39;Son of a stitch.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, well, I&#39;m sure that fooled God.
 <br>
 Hey, Dave, the Celtics are in town tomorrow.
 <br>
 You up for it? - I&#39;m in! - Oh.
 <br>
 Pastor Dave, tomorrow&#39;s Sunday.
 <br>
 You have church on Sunday.
 <br>
 Right, church.
 <br>
 Church, right.
 <br>
 Well,just get someone to sub for you.
 <br>
 Every Sunday I see six other guys up there in robes who only shake themselves awake when the wine comes out.
 <br>
 Any one of them could do your job.
 <br>
 Well, if God didn&#39;t want me to go to basketball he wouldn&#39;t have made foam fingers so much fun.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 The hand of God is pointing at you.
 <br>
 Okay, see you at church.
 <br>
 Yes! Another strike for Forman.
 <br>
 Man, is there anything better than bowling with the boys? Yeah.
 <br>
 - Making out with a chick.
 <br>
 - Exactly.
 <br>
 But first- Hey, Kelso, there are words on my balls.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 But they&#39;re gonna miss the finest game of Wisconsin&#39;s &#39;&#39;Velvet Thumb.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yes! It&#39;s another strike! You guys, I&#39;m in some kind of beery zone.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Hey,Jill? Hey, thanks for stopping by.
 <br>
 Hyde, wipe your mouth.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 I was gonna go home with Jill.
 <br>
 Well, we came together, Hyde so I kind of think we should leave together.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Steven, call me later.
 <br>
 Forman, what the hell are you doing, man? Me? You spent all night making out with little Miss Can&#39;t-find-a-bra.
 <br>
 - Hey! - Come on.
 <br>
 You made me the third wheel.
 <br>
 Who cares, man? Her parents are out of town, and they got a water bed! But you killed that dream.
 <br>
 I&#39;m out of here.
 <br>
 But-You don&#39;t get to storm out, okay? I storm out! Hiya, princess.
 <br>
 Rhonda? What are you doing here? Waitin&#39; for Fez, chompin&#39; some cheese curls.
 <br>
 You know what? Michael doesn&#39;t tell me where he goes either.
 <br>
 - I hate that.
 <br>
 - Kelso and Fez are on their way back from bowling.
 <br>
 They want to make out.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you know all this? Let&#39;s French, ladies! Michael, she&#39;s in the loop! Why am I not in the loop? All right.
 <br>
 Look,Jackie.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what loop you&#39;re talking about but if she&#39;s already in it I don&#39;t think there&#39;s gonna be room for you too.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re up early.
 <br>
 Surprisingly early.
 <br>
 You slept here? Already? You just met! Listen, Donna, I&#39;m gonna be honest with you.
 <br>
 Your father and I have started an intimate relationship.
 <br>
 And, you know, it&#39;s still a little awkward for us.
 <br>
 Emotionally, not physically.
 <br>
 Well, a little- I think I might be sick.
 <br>
 Look, I know this is a lot for you to take in right now.
 <br>
 But I think it would be better for all of us to just stop the charade and get it all out in the open.
 <br>
 Joanne! When did you get here? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Oh, look at the time.
 <br>
 And on a personal note, I have an announcement to make.
 <br>
 I have always found happiness in serving the good people of Point Place.
 <br>
 But after talking to a dear friend I realized that church is just not where the party is, if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m resigning as your pastor thanks to my friend Red Forman.
 <br>
 Red, give the crowd a wave.
 <br>
 ( Organ ) Well, if you weren&#39;t going to hell before, you&#39;re going first class now.
 <br>
 Go, Bucks! Kelso, you should tellJackie where you go.
 <br>
 That way, when she wants to do it, she can find you and do it.
 <br>
 Boy, do I want to do it.
 <br>
 Fez, the foundation of every good relationship is three words: &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Where are you going?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;What are you thinking about?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Who&#39;s that under you?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; You see, it&#39;s bulletproof.
 <br>
 Why are you friends with him? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 ( Eric ) Hyde, what the hell? What is she doing in my seat? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good one, Kelso.
 <br>
 Just sit on the floor.
 <br>
 The floor? Why don&#39;t I sit on the floor? Visitors get the floor, all right? And that&#39;s you, Terri Tube Top.
 <br>
 Oh, and by the way, it&#39;s winter! ( Scoffs ) You&#39;re a drag.
 <br>
 Okay, well, sayonara, Yoko.
 <br>
 What? We&#39;re kind of the Beatles.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s just supposed to be guys&#39; night out, right? And in walks Hyde&#39;s skank of the week to wreck it all.
 <br>
 Years of friendship trumped by one pair of lopsided boobs.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I noticed, but I didn&#39;t say anything because I&#39;m nice.
 <br>
 I had to talk to my dad&#39;s new girlfriend about the sex they had last night.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay, you win.
 <br>
 You know, at first, I thought it was great my dad had a friend.
 <br>
 But when I found out they were doin&#39; it it took things to, like, a sick place, you know? And it really made me realize that my mom is gone.
 <br>
 - Like, gone.
 <br>
 - Maybe you should say something.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 He&#39;s been through so much.
 <br>
 - I mean, I want him to be happy, you know? - Yeah.
 <br>
 So Bob&#39;s sleeping with Joanne, huh? God, am I, like, the only guy in Point Place who&#39;s not gettin&#39; any? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, you are.
 <br>
 - And you think that&#39;s funny? - Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I do.
 <br>
 Well, Mrs.
 <br>
 Candiotti just told me to shove a very holy book in a very unholy place.
 <br>
 Nice going, Red.
 <br>
 The whole church hates us now.
 <br>
 Kitty, I had nothing to do with Dave leaving the church.
 <br>
 You know, God works in mysterious ways.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;Let he who is without&#39;&#39;- - Oh, can it.
 <br>
 Well, the torch-carrying mob will be here any minute.
 <br>
 Better turn on the light.
 <br>
 They won&#39;t need a light.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve got torches.
 <br>
 Rhonda? How&#39;d you get in here? I used my key.
 <br>
 Michael, why does she have a key and I don&#39;t? Well, it&#39;s not because everyone doesn&#39;t want you to have one.
 <br>
 That&#39;s for sure.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t sweat it, small stuff.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all part of the gang.
 <br>
 - Excuse me? Uh, no.
 <br>
 I had to kiss butt for, like, a year to be part of this gang.
 <br>
 That was you being nice? Good God! She thinks she was being nice? Look, all I know is you are not a part of this gang.
 <br>
 Really? Well Snow White why don&#39;t we wrestle for it? And if I win, I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Street rules.
 <br>
 No tap-outs.
 <br>
 - Okay, okay, you&#39;re in! - Yea! I&#39;m in! That&#39;s nice, but maybe you should wrestle her anyways.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah! All right.
 <br>
 Shirts off!.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get it on! Oh, good.
 <br>
 You&#39;re both here.
 <br>
 Look, I know you two are together and, Dad, I want you to be happy.
 <br>
 But I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready for this.
 <br>
 Joanne! When did you get here? - Dad! - Bob! All right.
 <br>
 Donna, what do you want us to do? - You want us to stop seeing each other? - No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that- Well, could you go back to lying to me? I mean, that seemed to work.
 <br>
 I am always in favor of lying when it comes to children.
 <br>
 Bob, we were honest with Donna and now she&#39;s being honest with us.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll hold off on the overnight visits for a while.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 That&#39;s really-Thanks.
 <br>
 Well, if you&#39;re not staying the night, we&#39;d better get upstairs.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 Is that you? I didn&#39;t recognize you without Skankarilla hanging off your face.
 <br>
 Are you still on this? It&#39;s like having a wife.
 <br>
 Listen, don&#39;t flatter yourself.
 <br>
 I&#39;d only marry someone who&#39;s nice to his friends.
 <br>
 Her friends.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 The-The point is- Yeah, man, I get the point.
 <br>
 And you can drop it, all right? She dumped me.
 <br>
 - What? - Yeah.
 <br>
 She said she didn&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 I told her, &#39;&#39;Too bad.
 <br>
 We&#39;re friends.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And that was it.
 <br>
 Oh, man, I feel terrible.
 <br>
 Is there anything I can do? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 I kind of really liked her.
 <br>
 Hey, how does 1 0 bucks sound? Forman, 1 0 lousy bucks can&#39;t replaceJill.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 How about 20? Jill who? Okay.
 <br>
 - Hey, Red.
 <br>
 - Dave, what&#39;s with you? You don&#39;t just up and leave the church because I invited you to a basketball game on Sunday.
 <br>
 Red, you said it yourself.
 <br>
 There are six guys who would take my place.
 <br>
 No one would notice.
 <br>
 Sit down, Dave.
 <br>
 Let me tell you a little story about three bags of dog crap.
 <br>
 One on my front porch, one in my mailbox and one in the backseat of my car all from people who are so upset about losing you that they are willing to find, handle and bag dog crap.
 <br>
 Really? My congregation has turned to vandalism and petty harassment on account of me? I am truly blessed.
 <br>
 - Then you&#39;re staying? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Now, come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s celebrate by returning those bags to their rightful owner.
 <br>
 Like it says in the Bible, &#39;&#39;As you sow, so shall you reap.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Jesus was talking about love, but it works for doggy doo, I think.
 <br>
 -Jill, what are you doing here? - All right.
 <br>
 I confess.
 <br>
 &#39;Twas me.
 <br>
 I asked Jill to meet us here.
 <br>
 Jill, Hyde&#39;s my friend.
 <br>
 That&#39;s no reason to break up with him.
 <br>
 What? He broke up with me.
 <br>
 He said he had to spend time with you because of some brain inflammation that made you act like a dill-hole.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t have a brain thing.
 <br>
 He forgets he has it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s part of the disease.
 <br>
 Why did you lie to me? Yeah, and me.
 <br>
 Well, the thing is you like the Little River Band.
 <br>
 I mean, I- I can&#39;t be with a girl who likes the Little River Band.
 <br>
 Yeah, take that, missy! And you! You wouldn&#39;t shut up about me making out on guys&#39; night which wouldn&#39;t have bothered you if you had a tongue stuck down your throat.
 <br>
 So for the love of God, man, find a tongue! I do need a tongue.
 <br>
 Hey,Jill, I like the Little River Band.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) You&#39;re both freaks! ( Chuckles ) Nice try.
 <br>
 - What are you guys doing here? -Jackie and Rhonda are all mad at us.
 <br>
 We encourage one little topless girl fight.
 <br>
 And then all the sudden, we&#39;re the jerks.
 <br>
 - So let&#39;s bowl.
 <br>
 - Hey, guys, look.
 <br>
 I got 1 0-pound balls.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, my balls are black and blue.
 <br>
 - Good one.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 - That was good.
 <br>
 My balls are finally funny.
 <br>
 ( Whistle Blowing ) ( All Gasping ) No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 No tap-outs, you girl.
 <br>
 - ( All Gasping ) - ( Whistle Blowing ) Yes! We have a winner!
 <br>
