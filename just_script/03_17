<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Wow, Hyde.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe it.
 <br>
 Your own set of wheels.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 She is the best thing that ever happened to me.
 <br>
 Oh, except for that one time Kelso swallowed that fishhook.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] That was pretty cool too.
 <br>
 Yeah, that was one magic trick I could never get right.
 <br>
 All right, Hyde, this car is fine but, I mean, it&#39;s no Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 How many miles you gettin&#39; to the gallon? - Oh, about 11.
 <br>
 - Damn! Okay, fine.
 <br>
 But, you know, the Vista Cruiser can seat eight- nine if someone sits on the stain.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay, Forman, but do you have any idea how many chicks I can fit in the flatbed? Thirty-two.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s with Big Rhonda.
 <br>
 Damn! [Gasps] Eww! Oh, hello.
 <br>
 What are you doing back there, Fez? L- I was- I was just showing Caroline the back of my new car and my tongue.
 <br>
 Fez, this isn&#39;t your car.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Foreigners can&#39;t drive here unless it&#39;s a cab.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t he cute? Fezzie, I told you.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to try and impress me anymore.
 <br>
 I&#39;m your girlfriend now.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Caroline.
 <br>
 From now on, I will be totally honest.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Now, come on, walk me home.
 <br>
 - Ah, yes.
 <br>
 And on the way, I can tell you about the time I killed a shark with a coconut.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] All right, Kelso, let&#39;s go out cruising for hot chicks with self-esteem problems.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 No, thanks, man.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t do that stuff anymore.
 <br>
 Shut up and come on.
 <br>
 No, man, I mean it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve matured.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, wanna go to the mall? Rerun from What&#39;s HaPPening is opening up the new Dairy Queen.
 <br>
 Actually, Jackie, as fun as that sounds, um, no.
 <br>
 What? &#34;Hey, hey, hey.
 <br>
 &#34; - I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Well, let me get my beret and some Certs with Retsyn.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 You&#39;re too mature to go cruising with me, but you go to the mall with Jackie? Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s this new thing we&#39;re trying, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;re friends.
 <br>
 See, I did some reflecting, and I realized thatJackie is the only girl I want to be with.
 <br>
 Today? No, every day.
 <br>
 See, we were meant to be together.
 <br>
 She just doesn&#39;t know it yet.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I have a plan.
 <br>
 - Oh, no.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 See, she wants to be just friends, right? Okay, so I&#39;ll be her friend.
 <br>
 But what she doesn&#39;t realize is that I&#39;m also a boy.
 <br>
 Yeah, and sooner or later, friend is gonna lead down the path to boy.
 <br>
 And then I&#39;ll be her friend-boy.
 <br>
 That is a great plan.
 <br>
 - Okay, I&#39;m ready.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go, friend.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 That is such a bad plan.
 <br>
 Yeah, but, you know, on the bright side maybe we&#39;ll be there when it all blows up in his face.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Hey, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Happy birthday.
 <br>
 Ohh.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you remembered.
 <br>
 You are the first person to say anything all day.
 <br>
 And how did you know I needed more flashbulbs? Thank you.
 <br>
 - So, do you wanna stay for dinner? - Oh, no, thanks.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m just gonna grab a sandwich.
 <br>
 - A sandwich! Steven, a sandwich is a sandwich, but a Manwich is a meal.
 <br>
 - Oh, well, thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Hey, Mom, what&#39;s for dinner? I&#39;m starving.
 <br>
 - Manwiches.
 <br>
 - Again? Ahh, we just had those.
 <br>
 Kitty, I left my shirt on the bed.
 <br>
 It needs to be ironed for tomorrow.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Oh, and, uh I know you think I forgot, but I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] Oh, Red, I knew you&#39;d remember.
 <br>
 Yep, the check for the plumber is on the dresser.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Um is there anything else to eat? Well, you know what, honey? I don&#39;t give a good gosh darn what you eat! Wow, she&#39;s really upset.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Nice goin&#39;.
 <br>
 See, the boatneck adds dimension to your shoulders.
 <br>
 And the plum color- that really accents your jewel-toned eyes.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Michael, you just described my perfect outfit.
 <br>
 You are so good at this.
 <br>
 Yeah, I have a knack for ensembles.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde, how goes the cruising for chicks? It was going fine till I hit a patch of ice and almost took out a few of&#39;em.
 <br>
 Big Rhonda cracked my brake light.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Hi.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Have you seen Fez? Uh, no.
 <br>
 He went bowling with his host parents.
 <br>
 Damn him! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I was just hoping he&#39;d be here so we could study together.
 <br>
 Now I have to walk home alone in the dark.
 <br>
 It&#39;s scary out there.
 <br>
 Somebody ran over Big Rhonda.
 <br>
 - Um, do you want a- - Okay! Ride? You know, Michael, I&#39;m really enjoying our time together.
 <br>
 Really? Me too.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know, the makeup, shopping, braiding each other&#39;s hair- - you are like the girlfriend I never had.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Well, thanks, Jackie.
 <br>
 L-Wait.
 <br>
 - Girlfriend? - [Giggles] Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, Donna&#39;s nice and everything but she kinda dresses like a trucker.
 <br>
 [TV] The Waltons.
 <br>
 Now, there&#39;s a grateful family.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 And, boy, did they love their mother.
 <br>
 Oh, great.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;ve got athlete&#39;s foot.
 <br>
 I am- l- I am going to bed.
 <br>
 Where&#39;d your mother go? To bed.
 <br>
 Man, what&#39;s wrong with her anyway? Oh, who knows? She&#39;s been moody all day.
 <br>
 Let me see the TVGuide.
 <br>
 Ahh.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 What day is it? Ah, it&#39;s the 13th.
 <br>
 It seems to me I was supposed to do something on the 13th.
 <br>
 Oh, good Lord! You forgot your mother&#39;s birthday! Oh, no.
 <br>
 Dad, this is bad.
 <br>
 This is very, very bad.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t start gettin&#39; all twitchy.
 <br>
 Now, we gotta think.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s watch CHiPs and think.
 <br>
 [Radio: Rock, Faint] So, Fez is really nice, huh? - Yeah, Fez is a good guy.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, sometimes, when I&#39;m trying to sleep at night I think about how much it would hurt if he ever left me.
 <br>
 And then I say, &#34;Fez would never leave me.
 <br>
 &#34; But then I say, &#34;We&#39;ve only been going out for a short time.
 <br>
 Maybe he would leave me.
 <br>
 &#34; So then, I hold my breath until my lungs are about to explode because that&#39;s how much I think it would hurt if he ever did leave me.
 <br>
 And then, when I regain consciousness I start breathing again, and everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Oops.
 <br>
 There&#39;s my house.
 <br>
 Thanks! Bye! - See ya.
 <br>
 - [Door Closes] [Together] Happy birthday! Oh, you remembered? Well, of course we remembered, honey.
 <br>
 We just figured that we&#39;d wait till there was only 15 minutes left in the day and you were good and mad and then we&#39;d sneak up here and surprise the hell out of you.
 <br>
 Wow, what a good plan.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I was awfully mad.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 We really had you going.
 <br>
 Here, Mom.
 <br>
 Open this one first.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s from me.
 <br>
 - Well, thank you, honey.
 <br>
 Oh, a map of Wisconsin.
 <br>
 Oh, well, thank you.
 <br>
 And, Mom, I got you these balloons too.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] &#34;Knock out the knock-knocks at Schiffy&#39;s Gas-N-Go.
 <br>
 &#34; Huh.
 <br>
 Wait, Kitty, there&#39;s more! A funnel.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I know how much you like to pour things.
 <br>
 Well, um, either these gifts are really thoughtful or you bought a bunch of crap at the gas station! - What? - Oh, admit it, Red Forman.
 <br>
 You forgot my birthday.
 <br>
 - [Sighs] - Quick, Dad, give her the lighter.
 <br>
 Look, Kitty, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s just- Well, marking the calendar is your responsibility.
 <br>
 [Eric] Oh.
 <br>
 Dad, no.
 <br>
 Ah, good morning, sunshine.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s for breakfast? A funnel.
 <br>
 Ow.
 <br>
 What the heck makes Jackie think I&#39;m her girlfriend? All I did was pick out a few of her outfits paint her nails and give her a facial.
 <br>
 Gee, I don&#39;t know, Denise.
 <br>
 Um, guys, can we go inside? I&#39;m freezing my choo-choos off.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not going in there.
 <br>
 I forgot my mom&#39;s birthday.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause I remembered your mom&#39;s birthday.
 <br>
 - If you remembered, why didn&#39;t you tell me? - How would that be funny? I don&#39;t ever have to worry about forgetting Caroline&#39;s birthday.
 <br>
 She wrote it on my arm with permanent marker.
 <br>
 - Isn&#39;t she sweet? - More like psycho.
 <br>
 What are you doing calling my girlfriend psycho? I&#39;m sorry, Fez, did I say psycho? I meant nut bag, head case, wackadoo.
 <br>
 She chokes herself, man.
 <br>
 Well, Hyde, maybe- maybe you should- maybe you should choke yourself! Good day.
 <br>
 - Fez- - I said good day! Man, what fun is it being a girlfriend if you don&#39;t even have your own boobs to play with? So what, Kelso? So you&#39;re her girlfriend.
 <br>
 What could possibly be so bad about that? L-I&#39;ll tell you what could be so bad.
 <br>
 Oh, Michael, this is the happiest day of my life.
 <br>
 Thank you so much for being my maid of honor.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what girlfriends do.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just honored you asked me.
 <br>
 Yeah, but you know, on the flip side, try to think about your life withoutJackie at all.
 <br>
 [Water DriPPing] Wow.
 <br>
 That&#39;s even worse.
 <br>
 Hey, girlfriends sometimes make out together, right? Yeah, usually right after long, sweaty pillow fights.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, it happens all the time.
 <br>
 All right! Hey, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Is Eric home? - Eric? Oh, you mean my son, the map giver.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 - Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, are you okay? - Oh, I am just freakin&#39; fine! What happened? Well, you know I love my family.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just sometimes I want to get in the car and run &#39;em all over.
 <br>
 They forgot my birthday.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go kick Eric&#39;s ass right now! No.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s one thing when they don&#39;t notice when I get my hair done differently- which they don&#39;t- but this is my birthday.
 <br>
 Oh, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Maybe I expect too much.
 <br>
 No, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you have every right to be mad.
 <br>
 In fact, you should be madder.
 <br>
 You&#39;re, like, the best mom in the world.
 <br>
 Yeah! Thank you, Donna.
 <br>
 I just wish my own family would say that once in a while.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Oh, sweetie, that&#39;s not your breakfast, is it? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Why don&#39;t you just let me make you some nice waffles instead? Oh, cool.
 <br>
 I love frozen waffles.
 <br>
 Oh, honey.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 I make my waffles from scratch.
 <br>
 Those bastards! Now, would you look at her boobs? I am.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s- it&#39;s disgusting.
 <br>
 I mean, what is she thinking, packing in those sweet melons like that? I can&#39;t even look away.
 <br>
 You know, Michael, I have to say, I&#39;m really enjoying our new friendship together.
 <br>
 - I love spending time with you.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 Do you wanna go to your house and have a nice, sweaty pillow fight? [Gasps] Okay.
 <br>
 - Hello, Caroline.
 <br>
 - Oh, hi, Fez.
 <br>
 So, hey, listen, just, uh-just curious um do you sometimes choke yourself? Yeah.
 <br>
 But I only do it because I love you more than anything in the world.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m good with that.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get you a soda, lover.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t forget to breathe while I&#39;m gone.
 <br>
 Hey, so how&#39;s it going with &#34;Mental Mary&#34;? I owe you an apology, Hyde.
 <br>
 She is crazy.
 <br>
 But she&#39;s crazy for me.
 <br>
 [Gasping] [Sighs] [No Audible Dialogue] Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh! Here she comes.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 She didn&#39;t even look at us.
 <br>
 - [Sighs] - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen Mom so mad.
 <br>
 Have you? - Not since she stopped drinking.
 <br>
 - What? Nothing.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Look, obviously your mother&#39;s very upset about something.
 <br>
 And desperate times call for desperate measures.
 <br>
 For the last 10 years she&#39;s been asking us to do something and every time we say no.
 <br>
 Because what she wants is the most horrible thing in the world.
 <br>
 I won&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 Oh, you will do it.
 <br>
 And you will like it! Need a partner Turn the partner by the right hand round I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re finally square dancing.
 <br>
 Oh, this is so much fun.
 <br>
 It looks like &#34;Hee-Haw&#34; puked in here.
 <br>
 Come on, honey, let&#39;s dance.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 This is awful.
 <br>
 She made me waffles.
 <br>

 <br>
 So, happy birthday.
 <br>
 Ohh.
 <br>
 I thought square dance night was my present.
 <br>
 It is.
 <br>
 But we really messed up this year.
 <br>
 - Well, we&#39;re sorry.
 <br>
 - [Clicks Tongue] Ohh.
 <br>

 Okay.
 <br>
 Well- [Clears Throat] I think I&#39;ve had enough do-si-dos for one night.
 <br>
 So, what do you say we all go home and have hot fudge sundaes? - Oh, yes.
