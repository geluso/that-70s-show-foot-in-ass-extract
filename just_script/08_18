 Fez, guess what I just got The new Village People album ! How many songs can they write about where men go to massage each other ?! The navy These boys never let me down.
 <br>
 Disco sucks, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s painful to listen to.
 <br>
 It makes me wanna shoot myself.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the musical equivalent of Jackie.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Look at these guys, their music is so bad they need to wear disguises just so people don&#39;t beat the crap out of them.
 <br>
 Oh I heard how in Chicago they made a huge bonfire of disco records.
 <br>
 Also they cover their hotdogs in pastrami.
 <br>
 It&#39;s freakin&#39; awesome.
 <br>
 Man, we should have our own bonfire.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sick of corporations selling crap to kids that dumbs them down and makes them act stupid.
 <br>
 Hey, I can sell beer at the bonfire ! I have tons of old disco records we can burn.
 <br>
 What ?! I was young and what did you expect ? See the hair ? You guys are aweful.
 <br>
 Disco has been great to me.
 <br>
 Without disco, if I rub my crotch on a girl it&#39;s illegal.
 <br>
 With disco, it&#39;s a bar mitsva ! See, disco has given Fez and I some of our best times together.
 <br>
 Oh, like remember the night when we beat Johnny and Melina at that dance-off ? Ah, we kicked their gold-lamÃ© asses ! Oh you know what, I heard that Johnny is working at a carwash.
 <br>
 Yeah, uhuh, we did that to him ! Jackie be nice Car wash he&#39;s poor ! You see that, see, we got a trophy and and the satisfaction of learning that we ruined two peoples lives.
 <br>
 So you can have your little bonfire, but we&#39;re not going.
 <br>
 Yeah I&#39;m going to Weight Watchers to pick up women.
 <br>
 The thin ones are great but they have low self-esteem.
 <br>
 That way, you get a hot chick for fat girls prices ! Wait, wait, Fez.
 <br>
 Hey, maybe we should go.
 <br>
 You know, and defend the music that we love.
 <br>
 As a team.
 <br>
 Sure, what the hell.
 <br>
 Weight Watcher meetings will always be there.
 <br>
 God bless the dairy state.
 <br>
 We never run out of fat girls.
 <br>
 Pretty clever there, Jackie.
 <br>
 Using a disco bonfire as a way to cozy up next to the guy you secretly love.
 <br>
 You know it kinda reminds me of a song Jackie loves the foreign boy, ola, taco ! Look, I am not gonna sit back and let Fez try to pick up other women.
 <br>
 Much less fat chicks.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean maybe if we go together, he&#39;ll see that we&#39;re perfect for each other.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;m coming.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But if you get in the way of me setting things on fire, you&#39;re getting set on fire.
 <br>
 That &#39;70s Show - 8x18 - We will rock you Red, I invited the new neighbours over for coffee and cookies.
 <br>
 That way I can bad-mouth the rest of the block before they do it to me.
 <br>
 Kitty, I don&#39;t wanna meet new neighbours.
 <br>
 I had to wait twelve years for the old ones to croak.
 <br>
 Always wanted to talk and say &#34;Helloooo&#34;.
 <br>
 Dumbasses.
 <br>
 Oh, okay they&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Now, be nice.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t met the wife yet, but the husband Josh was very sweet.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a car salesman and he told me he could give me a great deal on a ?? just because he likes me.
 <br>
 Although he has to go and ask his supervisor first.
 <br>
 Hello Josh ! Hi Kitty.
 <br>
 Good to see you again ! This is Jeff.
 <br>
 - Hi Jeff ! Where&#39;s your wife ? - You&#39;re looking at her ! The only lady in my life is my little palmorini, Tina Louise.
 <br>
 Who is going to the pound if she doesn&#39;t stop humping my cowboy boots.
 <br>
 We are not having this conversation here Okay, well I&#39;m confused.
 <br>
 So, you two live together but I only saw the movers bringing in one bed.
 <br>
 Ohhhh Well Congratulations ! Look Red, the new neighbours are here and they&#39;re a couple of fellas Wait a second.
 <br>
 - You guys live together ? - Yep.
 <br>
 - Without any wives of girlfriends ? - Yep.
 <br>
 - You know what I call guys like you ?! - Oh dear Lucky bastards ! Well, the bonfire looks pretty sturdy.
 <br>
 But remember, when the flames get too high, you saw the foreign kid play with the matches.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Who was that girl you were talking to ? Oh, Lisa Conner.
 <br>
 A girl I dated a couple of years ago when I was a camp counselor.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I never knew you were a camp counselor.
 <br>
 It didn&#39;t last too long.
 <br>
 Apparently, going out on a canoe trip with six kids and coming back with five is a big no-no.
 <br>
 Hey man.
 <br>
 How much for a beer ? One dollar.
 <br>
 Awesome.
 <br>
 There you go.
 <br>
 Now, if you want it in a cup, that&#39;s an extra three bucks.
 <br>
 Oh, and there&#39;s a two dollar pouring charge.
 <br>
 You want six bucks for a beer ?! You can always go to the other place.
 <br>
 There is no other place.
 <br>
 Whadayaknow Looks like I got what you call a monopoly.
 <br>
 You have change for a ten ? Nope.
 <br>
 There he is officer ! Here&#39;s the guy who is responsible for this illegal gathering of dirty and ugly people.
 <br>
 These two tell me you organised an illegal bonfire ? You two narked on me ? What ? You stand there and accuse me of narking ?! No sir, no, I did not nark.
 <br>
 What&#39;s nark ? Calling the cops.
 <br>
 Oh yes we narked.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right Steven.
 <br>
 Because Fez and I both feel that burning disco records is wrong.
 <br>
 Just like burning books but worse, because disco tells a story.
 <br>
 This is a disco burning bonfire ? That&#39;s fantastic ! Disco sucks ! Ah.
 <br>
 What do you know Degenerate, cop, having a beer together.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a disco-sucking miracle.
 <br>
 You know I&#39;m taking an astronomy class in college right now.
 <br>
 You see those three stars in a row right there ? Uhuh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s Virgo.
 <br>
 That&#39;s an airplane.
 <br>
 I do not go to a good school.
 <br>
 - Oh my God, Randy ?! - Linda ? - Oh my god ! Missy is here too ! - Is she ? Oh my god ! I&#39;ll go get her ! Who was that ? Uh Linda.
 <br>
 I dated her.
 <br>
 And her sister, Missy.
 <br>
 Not together, there was a summer in between them.
 <br>
 Summer was their cousin Wow.
 <br>
 I&#39;m dating a man-slut.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m sure you dated a lot of people too.
 <br>
 I mean, if we took all the people I&#39;ve dated and all the people you&#39;ve dated - and put them in a room together - We&#39;d have a room full of girls, and Eric ! What do you guys have against disco ?! It&#39;s the only thing white people can dance to ! Hey uh, Jackie.
 <br>
 I was thinking of a way to get back at you, calling the cops and all that.
 <br>
 And then it hit me.
 <br>
 You&#39;re only here to get with Fez.
 <br>
 So I figured, why not find the skankiest, sluttiest, drunkest chick here give her three more beers and then introduce her to Fez.
 <br>
 - Oh you wouldn&#39;t ! - Oh I already did.
 <br>
 - You didn&#39;t ! - I just said I did.
 <br>
 - You wouldn&#39;t dare ! - I did ! Turn around and look ! Enjoy your evening Fez ! Uh, what are you doing ? It&#39;s fantastic ! Every time I say disco sucks, Kelly sticks her tongue down my throat ! Watch : disco sucks ! It&#39;s like a magic trick ! But uhm Fez, you&#39;re supposed to be here with me ! Beside, don&#39;t you know about rocker chicks ? They all have syfilis.
 <br>
 - Do you have syfilis ? - Uhm, I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good enough for me baby ! What a game ! That quarterback&#39;s eleven for twelve with no interception.
 <br>
 - He is hot ! - Ridiculously hot Oh, another cookie ? - What ? - Nothing.
 <br>
 I just thought we were trying to slim down for the Bahamas.
 <br>
 Well excuse me Mr.
 <br>
 Two-Scoopes-Of-Sugar You guys don&#39;t need wives, you bicker like an old married couple ! Red, I need to talk to you in the kitchen.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;m watching the game Ohh fine.
 <br>
 You know I wish there was a bar we could go to where there&#39;d be no women, just guys.
 <br>
 I know a few I am having it ! Okay Kitty, what is it ? It&#39;s about the neighbours, there is something you should know.
 <br>
 TOUCHDOWN ! Dammit see what you made me miss ?! Kitty, I think those guys are gay ! Red, you can&#39;t hide from Jeff and Josh all night ! Not all night.
 <br>
 Just till they eat all the cookies and decide to skip home.
 <br>
 Red Forman ! Our neighbours are gay, so what ? At least they&#39;ll keep the place nice and our property values will go up.
 <br>
 What am I supposed to say to them now ?! You&#39;ve been talking to them the whole game, you knew what to say then.
 <br>
 Well that was before I saw them kissing in my living room ! Didn&#39;t bother you last night, when you saw Abbott kiss Costello.
 <br>
 Well that was different.
 <br>
 They had to do that to fool the landlord.
 <br>
 - Hey Red, can I borrow some socks ? - No.
 <br>
 Bob, we&#39;re having a crisis here.
 <br>
 Our new neighbours are gay ! They&#39;re gay ? Aw great, now they&#39;re gonna be all over me.
 <br>
 What the hell are you talking about ? I can&#39;t explain it.
 <br>
 Men find me attractive.
 <br>
 YeahÂeverybody wants a piece of the Pinci.
 <br>
 Well Red, you can&#39;t let them sit in there all night ! What if they rearrange my furniture ?! Fine ! I&#39;llÂI&#39;ll Âtalk to them.
 <br>
 Okay, but handle it gracefully ! Well of course I will ! Give me a little credit.
 <br>
 Good night guys ! I have to go throw up again ! Okay Hurry back Hey Fez ! Village People, what are you doing here ? We came to put a stop to your disco-bonfire.
 <br>
 Plus my Mom was in Kenosha, so you knowÂ two birds with one stone.
 <br>
 Can you keep a secret ? I love disco.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m just pretending to hate it so I can get with girls.
 <br>
 You guys know how that is, right guys ? So, let&#39;s talk about Jackie.
 <br>
 You two came here together to defend disco and you abandoned her to make out with some skank you&#39;re never gonna see again.
 <br>
 - AaaandÂ? - And ? It&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 What do we have to do, spell it out for you ? Because we can, with carefully choreographed arm movementsÂ You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I totally let Jackie down.
 <br>
 You are one wise Indian.
 <br>
 Actually I&#39;m Puertorican.
 <br>
 This is just a gig.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m done vomiting.
 <br>
 Wanna finish making out ? I would love to.
 <br>
 But I can&#39;t for two reasons.
 <br>
 One : I have somewhere to be.
 <br>
 And two : you have some spagetthi right hereÂ So it turns out, Randy had dated every girl here.
 <br>
 I can literally throw a rock and hit a girl he&#39;s dated.
 <br>
 In fact, earlier I did.
 <br>
 She&#39;s gonna need stitches.
 <br>
 Oh, I remember that girl.
 <br>
 I sold her a bandaid for 8 bucks.
 <br>
 Where did you find a bandaid ? I pulled it off some guy who&#39;s passed out.
 <br>
 Donna ! Donna look what I found.
 <br>
 This is Sarah.
 <br>
 A girl I&#39;ve never dated, who I don&#39;t wanna date and who doesn&#39;t want to date me.
 <br>
 - Right Sarah ? - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Although you are kinda cute.
 <br>
 Goodbye Sarah.
 <br>
 Would you like to go out sometime ? - Go away Sarah.
 <br>
 - Call me ! Man, the keg&#39;s tapped.
 <br>
 Looks like everyone took a turn.
 <br>
 Just like with Randy.
 <br>
 Alright.
 <br>
 It&#39;s time to light this bonfire Rockers of Point Place ! It is time for fire !!! No, Steven no, you can&#39;t burn these records ! You&#39;re right Jackie, I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Because I&#39;m too drunk.
 <br>
 Randy ! Come burn these records ! - Stop ! - Fez ? You came back ! Jackie, I need to tell you something, something about you and me.
 <br>
 Really ? Yes, this whole time I was off making out with that girl and all of a sudden it felt wrong.
 <br>
 - It did ? - Yes.
 <br>
 I shouldn&#39;t have been with her.
 <br>
 I should have been with you.
 <br>
 Oh my God.
 <br>
 Fez, I wanted to hear that for so long.
 <br>
 Loo- I feel the same way.
 <br>
 I realised something and I want everyone to know it ! Jackie Burkhart and I are in love ! With disco ! Wait.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 what ? Yeah, and I will not stand by and let you set fire to this muscial, booty-shakin&#39; masterpieces ! That&#39;s unfortunateÂ So you did pretty well tonight.
 <br>
 Yup.
 <br>
 And I learned a valuable lesson about art versus commerce.
 <br>
 The lesson is : I&#39;m rich.
 <br>
 Good for you man.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m gonna have to write you a little ticket for disturbing the peace and that&#39;s gonna cost you aboutÂ How much you got there ? - 208 bucks.
 <br>
 - 208 bucks ! Fine.
 <br>
 Uhh, officer Ron ? You don&#39;t wanna buy your badge back ? Oh, uh, and your car ? Oh, this whole night has been a nightmare.
 <br>
 You know I thought Fez was gonna tell me he loved me, but no, he was just trying to be a good friend.
 <br>
 Ugh, what a jerk.
 <br>
 Jackie, everybody could use another friend.
 <br>
 Well except Randy.
 <br>
 What are you looking at bitch ?! Avon calling ! Josh ! Jeff ! You&#39;re back ! Look Red, Josh and Jeff are back ! HeyyyÂ men Red, we just wanted to come by and thank you.
 <br>
 - Thank me ? - Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not that easy for two guys like us to just move in to a new neighbourhood and make friends.
 <br>
 But you welcomed us into your home with open arms.
 <br>
 WellÂ sureÂ You&#39;re a couple of decent guys.
 <br>
 Not before he had his coffeeÂ Like you&#39;re a ray of sunshine ! Anyway, you&#39;ve been great.
 <br>
 The last place we lived, we had to tell people we were brothers.
 <br>
 Who would ever believe that the two of us could be brothers ?! Anyway, we wanted to give you this, you know, to say thanks.
 <br>
 What is it ? Fruit-cake.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s clever ! It&#39;s a dessert and an ice-breaker ! Well, what do you say we all sit down and watch the Packers kick the crap out of the Vikings, huh ? Well, we like the VikingsÂ What did you sayÂ ? You&#39;re Viking-fans ?! What the hell is wrong with you ?! Get out of my house ! Red come on, it&#39;s not our fault.
 <br>
 We&#39;re from Minnesota.
 <br>
 We were born this way ! Out ! Out ! Sicko&#39;s ! Well thanks a lot Red.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;ll never know what rug ties this room together.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Next please.
 <br>
 Pokpokpok, hi guys ! I love it, that&#39;s exactly what we need ! Leather guy, you&#39;re out, Chicken you&#39;re in.
 <br>
 Halleluja !
