<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Wow! Donna, you look great.
 <br>
 What could it be? ( Gasps ) Oh, I know.
 <br>
 You lost ( Laughs ) Burn, Eric, burn! Okay, first of all I weigh a 1 30- 49 pounds.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You look good too, Eric.
 <br>
 You lost your one true love, so- Looking good.
 <br>
 Eric, I found these records of yours, and I thought you might want them back.
 <br>
 Ah, the unpleasant exchange of possessions after the horrific breakup.
 <br>
 Awkward for them, entertaining for us.
 <br>
 Whoa, whoa.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Don Kirshner&#39;s starting.
 <br>
 Oh, right.
 <br>
 Paul McCartney and Wings are on tonight.
 <br>
 ( TV: Man Singing Pop Rock ) Okay, so- Okay, we&#39;re all here now.
 <br>
 So- So, Donna, you&#39;re staying? Okay.
 <br>
 What I meant to say was- Look, Donna, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cool if you hang out here.
 <br>
 ( Continues ) So, what, you&#39;re, like, kicking me out? Wow.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Okay then.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Well, if you&#39;re kicking her out, then you&#39;re kicking me out.
 <br>
 No,Jackie, no.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 I mean, bye! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! So, it&#39;s just not fair.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t, like, get my friends &#39;cause he has some stupid, crappy basement.
 <br>
 Right! You helped make that basement what it is today.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 No one would even go over there before me.
 <br>
 It smelled like feet.
 <br>
 Donna, you have to fight back.
 <br>
 Okay, when a couple splits up the woman deserves her fair share of the life she helped build.
 <br>
 - How much is that? - All of it! Donna, it&#39;s the law.
 <br>
 You know, normally, that statement would really offend me.
 <br>
 But now that I&#39;m single and pissed, you&#39;re making a lot of sense.
 <br>
 And then shejust comes down in the basement like it&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 After what happened? And she&#39;s just gonna act like everything&#39;s cool and everything&#39;s fine? You don&#39;t love me, you don&#39;t get my couch or my friends.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a package deal, baby.
 <br>
 ! So, I just told her, &#39;&#39;Fire up those walking sticks, Big Red, because this ain&#39;t happening.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not having it.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Sighs ) Hey, Forman, we were all there, and that ain&#39;t how it happened.
 <br>
 You wanna talk about it some more? Mmm, no.
 <br>
 ( Doorbell Rings ) - Hello, Kitty.
 <br>
 - Oh, Pastor Dave! What a nice surprise.
 <br>
 How&#39;s God? Fine, thank you.
 <br>
 So, I was wondering if, uh, Red was home.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 What did he do? No.
 <br>
 No, no, nothing.
 <br>
 I just thought he might like to, uh- I don&#39;t know- goof off? You want to spend time with Red.
 <br>
 - Unless it&#39;s a bad time.
 <br>
 - Oh, no, no, no.
 <br>
 This is a great time.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! Red has a visitor! Red, Pastor Dave&#39;s here! For you! Hurry! Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I ran into him in the hardware store.
 <br>
 You know, he was gonna try to paint his garage without priming.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) That crazy bastard.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Oh, my.
 <br>
 Red has a friend.
 <br>
 Psst! ( Whispering ) What are you guys doing today? ( Whispering ) We&#39;re going to the basement.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Sounds fun.
 <br>
 But you know what sounds like even more fun? Oh! Playing with a bunch of monkeys? Well, yeah.
 <br>
 But we got cable TV at my house which we all know has the potential for flashes of brief nudity.
 <br>
 Nudity! Cable? Oh, you are so gonna win this breakup! Now, wait just a minute.
 <br>
 Eric is our friend, our brother.
 <br>
 We cannot just abandon him for nude boobs.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Good point, Fez.
 <br>
 This nudity you speak of, are we talking full frontal? - Does it matter? - No.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 ( TV: Indistinct ) So, you have no idea where everyone is? Everyone who? Hey, you got any Popsicles? Donna&#39;s all out.
 <br>
 Oh, so that&#39;s how it is? Everyone&#39;s over at Donna&#39;s? Eric, man, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 And I know that we&#39;ve been friends for, like, a really long time but, uh, we were watching Barbarella on cable.
 <br>
 Man, and I not only saw boobs, but I saw boobs in space! Yeah, space boobs, Eric! There&#39;s no gravity! She got cable? That sneaky little wench.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 And corn dogs.
 <br>
 - ( Door Closes ) - Oh, dogs wrapped in corn.
 <br>
 Oh, sweet meat on a stick.
 <br>
 -Just go.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;At Dave&#39;s.
 <br>
 Back around 5:00.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh! I hadn&#39;t realized before, but the primer is like your emotions.
 <br>
 It&#39;s what&#39;s underneath the surface.
 <br>
 And the rust is like your anger.
 <br>
 Boy having a male companion to talk to is changing my life.
 <br>
 I wish I could tell Kitty exactly how I feel about her but I just can&#39;t find the words.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll help you.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll find the words together.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Oh, sure sometimes I feel like crying, but I just can&#39;t.
 <br>
 You can with me.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Oh, hello.
 <br>
 So, how was your day? What did you and your new friend do? Well- ( Sighs ) ( TV: Crowd Cheering ) - ( Grunts ) - ( Grunts ) - So, that&#39;s all you did? - Yep.
 <br>
 Well, you didn&#39;t talk about anything? Nope.
 <br>
 - Do you hate him? - Kitty, don&#39;t start.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m saying is, people with friends live longer.
 <br>
 And you are not good at keeping friends.
 <br>
 Bob&#39;s scared of you, and Earl isn&#39;t speaking to you.
 <br>
 - What about Frank? - Frank&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 It is time to replace your dead friend Frank.
 <br>
 I win.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) ( TV: Instrumental ) Oh, look, there&#39;s a boob! There&#39;s two.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 Four.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the mother lode.
 <br>
 - Oh, man.
 <br>
 Guy butt.
 <br>
 Look away.
 <br>
 - ( Groans ) I feel kinda bad.
 <br>
 Hon, it&#39;s just guy butt.
 <br>
 It won&#39;t hurt you.
 <br>
 No! About Eric.
 <br>
 I mean, he was totally in the right to kick Donna out.
 <br>
 Oh, he was not right.
 <br>
 Now, you agree with me! No.
 <br>
 - ( Groans ) - Agree with me.
 <br>
 No! Donna broke his heart, and now she should have to pay.
 <br>
 - Chex Mix? - Oh, thank you, Donna.
 <br>
 Oh, we are so not talking.
 <br>
 - All right,Jack- - I said, not talking! - Well done.
 <br>
 - All right, Fez.
 <br>
 The- I said, well done! Oh, there are all my friends.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, I found these socks of yours so I thought I&#39;d just, you know, run &#39;em right over.
 <br>
 Eric, you can&#39;t hang out here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really uncomfortable, so- Uncomfortable? ( Chuckles ) Who&#39;s uncomfortable? Oh, fine.
 <br>
 Look, man, I&#39;d go with you, but, you know, it&#39;s cable.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Hey, want me to come by later and tell you about the boobs? No! Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Dave for you.
 <br>
 ( Squeals ) ( Clears Throat ) Yeah? Fine.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) You do not grunt to a friend.
 <br>
 - Friends don&#39;t grunt.
 <br>
 - ( Grunts ) Okay, so I was over at the Pinciottis&#39; crouched behind the hedge next to the house, and I distinctly heard laughter.
 <br>
 Laughter! Well, I will tell you what.
 <br>
 I am not going down without a fight.
 <br>
 No, sirree, Bob.
 <br>
 Bob! The kids really like my jokes? Oh.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, if you only knew the number of times Donna&#39;s shared one of your doozies with the gang.
 <br>
 Lordy, how we laugh and laugh.
 <br>
 - And laugh.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) Right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m goin&#39;.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 But the tennis pro says &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t serve those kind of balls.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Singing Lounge Pop ) ( Fez Mouthing Lyrics ) ( Ends ) Welcome home, friends.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Who wants Popsicles? Hey, I don&#39;t feel good about this.
 <br>
 Well, would you rather be at Donna&#39;s singing backup to &#39;&#39;Cha Cha Di Amore&#39;&#39;? -Oh.
 <br>
 Well, will you look who&#39;s here.
 <br>
 -That was a dirty trick, Forman.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;d love to stay and talk about it, but we&#39;re on our way to the movies.
 <br>
 ( All ) Yeah.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;m taking them bowling Saturday.
 <br>
 Yeah! Fine.
 <br>
 Ooh, what a fun weekend.
 <br>
 Hey, look, you guys can&#39;t buy our loyalty with these little field trips.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna have to start buying us some stuff we can take home.
 <br>
 Well, look, I think it&#39;s stupid to have to go day by day.
 <br>
 Why doesn&#39;t Donna just get us on the weekends? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not fair because then Eric gets all the weekday headaches and Donna gets all the fun time.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Then we&#39;ll make a schedule.
 <br>
 Eric? Fine.
 <br>
 Have a seat.
 <br>
 Make sure to schedule time with Bob.
 <br>
 He takes me to Chuckle Town.
 <br>
 So, um, what are you and Dave gonna do today? Go out to the garage and talk friend to friend? That would be nice.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna turn on the fight and watch two nice men beat the living hell out of each other.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - ( Doorbell Rings ) - Oh.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Oh, come on in, Pastor Dave.
 <br>
 Red and I are just so happy that you are here.
 <br>
 - Especially Red.
 <br>
 - Kitty.
 <br>
 I want you to know that it is so nice for Red to finally have a boyfriend.
 <br>
 For God sakes, Kitty! Oh, lighten up, silly.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Man friend.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Whatever.
 <br>
 Someone to talk to, share their feelings with.
 <br>
 Anyway, you are an important part of Red&#39;s life.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 - Well- - Wait.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t listen to her.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t really want to share my feelings with you.
 <br>
 Hell, I don&#39;t even think I have feelings.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s just watch these two guys beat the crap out of each other.
 <br>
 Sold! Well, I don&#39;t care what you say.
 <br>
 You&#39;re boyfriends, and that&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 You know, Red, I am so glad that I have someone to share with because I woke up this morning feeling upset.
 <br>
 Ha-ha! I gotcha! Good one, Dave.
 <br>
 Good one! Don&#39;t ever do that again.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just saying, Forman you really didn&#39;t deliver on the afternoon like I was hoping.
 <br>
 Dude, I took you everywhere.
 <br>
 I bought everything.
 <br>
 It was a great day.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 I mean, I asked you for a six-pack.
 <br>
 You brought me out a tall boy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just saying.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 They&#39;re all yours.
 <br>
 Twenty minutes late.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 We had to stop so Fez could pee.
 <br>
 Yes, it was my fault.
 <br>
 Please do not fight.
 <br>
 Eric, listen, travel time should come out of your time, not mine.
 <br>
 What&#39;s on Fez&#39;s face? Nothing.
 <br>
 Nothing.
 <br>
 Is that ice cream? Now he won&#39;t want dinner! I am sorry I ate ice cream, Donna.
 <br>
 - Do not be mad.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Fez, I&#39;m mad at Eric, not at you.
 <br>
 This is not about you.
 <br>
 Listen, I&#39;m not about to limit our good time to help with yours.
 <br>
 - Why would you do anything to help me? - Oh, you listen, missy.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not gonna- - Stop it! Stop it! You are tearing us apart! I hope you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;ve upset Fez.
 <br>
 Yeah, and your fighting is making me and Jackie fight and that interferes with us doing it.
 <br>
 And that ain&#39;t good.
 <br>
 So, until you guys fix this, we&#39;re not hanging out with either one of you.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Hyde, I&#39;m sticky.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get you cleaned up.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sleepy.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 You had a big day! This is your fault.
 <br>
 None of this would have happened if you hadn&#39;t been such a jerk and kicked me out of the basement.
 <br>
 Well, you came in and you were just so &#39;&#39;Oh, we broke up, and I don&#39;t care, and, hey, let&#39;s just watch TV.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Tra la la la la Eric, I was faking it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m miserable and uncomfortable, and this whole thing sucks.
 <br>
 You&#39;re miserable? Well, that&#39;s great! I mean, I&#39;m miserable too.
 <br>
 Okay, so, how about this? We just hang out together and pretend everything&#39;s fine for, you know- for the sake of our friends.
 <br>
 I can do that.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 But, you know, ( Sighs ) you have to stop trying to look so hot when you come over.
 <br>
 I have not been doing that.
 <br>
 Red lipstick, no bra? Okay, yeah, I did that.
 <br>
 And, Fez, you sit on the dryer.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 This new seating arrangement should really work.
 <br>
 There you kids are.
 <br>
 I think I finally remembered the punch line to the Italian midget joke.
 <br>
 - My mom made fish.
 <br>
 - I gotta register for the draft.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 - I gotta go count my G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joes.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in the oven.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Tough room.
