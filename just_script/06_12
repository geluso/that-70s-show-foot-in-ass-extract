<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, guys, this is my co-cadet at the police academy, Suzy Simpson.
 <br>
 Simpson, these are my friends.
 <br>
 Take a good look, &#39;cause you&#39;ll probably be arresting some of them in the future.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 This one looks like the guy in the &#34;What drugs can do to you&#34; filmstrip.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a cop, huh? You don&#39;t look like a cop.
 <br>
 You look kind of giggly.
 <br>
 All right, Simpson needed to give me a ride home, &#39;cause I sprayed myself with mace to see what it&#39;d feel like.
 <br>
 Hey, so, Suzy, which &#34;Charlie&#39;s Angels&#34; is your favorite The brainy one, the sporty one or the one that just can&#39;t find a bra? Mine&#39;s the one that just can&#39;t find a bra.
 <br>
 &#34;Charlie&#39;s Angels&#34; are an embarrassment to the badge.
 <br>
 No real cop would last a day dressed like those sluts.
 <br>
 Hey, those sluts are my heroes.
 <br>
 Hey, thanks for giving me a ride, Simpson.
 <br>
 We back up our own.
 <br>
 Point place police, crime free, safe streets! What&#39;s her problem with &#34;charlie&#39;s angels&#34;? Ugh, I bet she watches pbs.
 <br>
 So you and Simpson have been friends for almost two days now, huh? Isn&#39;t it about time you got her pregnant? No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s different with me and Simpson.
 <br>
 For the first time ever, I have a girl that&#39;s just a friend.
 <br>
 Like, when Simpson talks, I actually listen instead of watching her boobs go up and down.
 <br>
 Kelso, you&#39;ve finally gotten past the stage where you have to look at every woman&#39;s chest.
 <br>
 Congratulations.
 <br>
 Not exactly.
 <br>
 I&#39;m lookin&#39; at yours right now.
 <br>
 May I say, congratulations to you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re such a perv.
 <br>
 And thank you.
 <br>
 Oh, hey.
 <br>
 What took you guys so long at the heart doctor&#39;s? Oh, let me guess.
 <br>
 You had to call in a specialist just to find dad&#39;s tiny heart.
 <br>
 You know, we could call in a specialist to find my foot in your ass.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna need an ass-footologist, stat.
 <br>
 Your father&#39;s blood pressure is still high, and the doctor can&#39;t figure out why.
 <br>
 So he wants to send some moron over to find the source of my stress.
 <br>
 And I said, &#34;the source of my stress &#34;is when you quacks try to pad my medical bill.
 <br>
 &#34; And then the machine went &#34;beep&#34; and the appointment was over.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re so worried about.
 <br>
 They&#39;re just gonna blame me.
 <br>
 Shrinks love to blame the wife.
 <br>
 What do they know? They&#39;re barely doctors.
 <br>
 A stuffed animal and a box of tissues could do their job.
 <br>
 Why is Red so stressed? Huh, it&#39;s a mystery, just like when Nancy Drew had to figure out why the man in the clock tower was so mean to his cat.
 <br>
 And what did you found out? Oh, I don&#39;t know, books are too long.
 <br>
 Hello, Wisconsin! Hi, I&#39;m the stress management specialist, Stuart Sutcliffe.
 <br>
 You played tight end for the packers.
 <br>
 Yeah, till I bent my knee sideways.
 <br>
 Actually, that happened to me in the school musical.
 <br>
 Yeah, I was a dancing mushroom.
 <br>
 Anyway, long story short I finished the number.
 <br>
 This is my son Eric.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, and I am his loving, relaxing wife, kitty.
 <br>
 How about that? A real live packer in the house.
 <br>
 Ha ha ha ha.
 <br>
 Well, I hope the fact that you both love sports doesn&#39;t mean that anyone like, say, his wife would be judged unfairly.
 <br>
 I mean, I love sports.
 <br>
 So don&#39;t start me off with four strikes in the last quarter of the super series.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Today I&#39;m just a neutral observer with a degree in family therapy and alcohol awareness.
 <br>
 Oh, so, dad, you can talk to him about sports, and, mom, you can talk to him about drinking.
 <br>
 Ha ha ha ha ha.
 <br>
 Oh, pooh.
 <br>
 I was instructed by the doctor to have the occasional medicinal cocktail.
 <br>
 I have a note.
 <br>
 Red, how do you feel about kitty&#39;s drinking? Makes things easier.
 <br>
 But drinking often adds a lot of stress to a household.
 <br>
 If you will excuse me, I&#39;d rather not stay here and listen to you blame me.
 <br>
 Mother hater.
 <br>
 Well, I hope nobody minds if I record today&#39;s session.
 <br>
 Hey, this is your lucky day, son.
 <br>
 They say the camera adds 15 pounds.
 <br>
 Really? I heard it also adds a full head of hair.
 <br>
 Hey, kitty.
 <br>
 You busy? No.
 <br>
 Red and I are just having our marriage dissected by a teetotaling know-it-all.
 <br>
 Oh, then is now a good time to tell red I broke his chain saw? No.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll be furious with you.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 He will be furious with you.
 <br>
 Come with me.
 <br>
 So then all the mushrooms jitterbugged Stuart.
 <br>
 Stuart.
 <br>
 This is Bob, the stress causer, Bob broke red&#39;s chain saw.
 <br>
 Bob, meet Stuart.
 <br>
 Stuart, blame Bob.
 <br>
 Red, how do you feel about Bob? Does he cause you stress? Not really.
 <br>
 Bob&#39;s just kind of goofy, like a cartoon.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like living next to Elmer Fudd.
 <br>
 That might be the nicest thing you&#39;ve ever said about me.
 <br>
 You wascal.
 <br>
 Heh heh heh heh.
 <br>
 Oh, so fine.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re best friends.
 <br>
 Now everyone&#39;s all happy, and I look like the crazy one just yelling and screaming in the middle of the living room.
 <br>
 Well, I am not the crazy one, even though I am yelling and screaming in the middle of the living room.
 <br>
 Is that a camera? Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m recording today&#39;s session.
 <br>
 Well, isn&#39;t that just something I didn&#39;t know.
 <br>
 ? Michael, we got issued our cop sunglasses.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been using &#39;em to scare the crap out of civilians all day.
 <br>
 Drop the records, punk! I wasn&#39;t stealing them.
 <br>
 Yes, I was.
 <br>
 Fez, this is Suzy Simpson.
 <br>
 She and I are training to be cops.
 <br>
 Oh, if there&#39;s more like you at the police academy, that academy deserves an award.
 <br>
 Academy award that&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Yeah, Simpson&#39;s wanted to be a cop for, like, forever.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s because of the weapons mostly.
 <br>
 I love things that make a lot of noise Guns and boys.
 <br>
 Well, then load me up, baby, cause I&#39;m ready to go bang.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;d better go.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve gotta stop at the candy store.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 You like candy? Yeah, I&#39;m out of good &amp; plenty.
 <br>
 It says on the box that there&#39;s plenty But it&#39;s never enough.
 <br>
 Jinx.
 <br>
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
 <br>
 You owe me a coke! That is the woman I&#39;ve been searching for my whole life! Hey, do you want me to see if she likes you? Kelso, we&#39;ve been down that road.
 <br>
 Just give me her address, some binoculars, and I&#39;ll handle the rest myself.
 <br>
 Now while we&#39;re filming, let&#39;s just pretend the camera&#39;s not even here.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re going to interact.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna write down my observations.
 <br>
 While you&#39;re writing down stuff, would you mind autographing this football? It&#39;s brand-new.
 <br>
 Kid never touched it.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s going on? Dude, we&#39;re on tv.
 <br>
 How does this thing work? Hey, Steven, point it at me.
 <br>
 Good morning, Dallas.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Jackie sunshine with your morning weather.
 <br>
 It is going to be sunny today.
 <br>
 So you ladies who let yourself go this winter, stay inside and leave the fellas to us pretty girls.
 <br>
 Please stop touching my camera.
 <br>
 Well, what a lovy day here in the household of the Formans.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t say there&#39;s a place I&#39;d rather be than with these kinds of people in this kind of place.
 <br>
 What are you, Scarlett O&#39;Hara now? I am being soft and gracious.
 <br>
 Now clam it! Mom, you know, they have talkies now.
 <br>
 Oh, forget it.
 <br>
 I give up.
 <br>
 Where is the &#34;off&#34; button on this thing? Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I need to see things as they happen! All right, you clocked this lady doin&#39; 38 in a 35 zone.
 <br>
 Recite it and write it.
 <br>
 License and registration, ma&#39;am.
 <br>
 Use the glasses.
 <br>
 They&#39;re powerful.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like a gun you wear on your face.
 <br>
 License and registration, ma&#39;am.
 <br>
 Ooh, that felt good.
 <br>
 Hey, guess what.
 <br>
 I know someone who likes you and thinks that you&#39;re cute and smart and funny.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 Well, I think I know who you&#39;re talking about, and I like him, too.
 <br>
 Huh? What do you like about him? I like how hot he looks sitting across from me I n a blue t-shirt eating a hot dog.
 <br>
 You just described me.
 <br>
 Oh, crap.
 <br>
 Man, I thought Simpson was different.
 <br>
 She&#39;s supposed to just be my buddy.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m gonna have to sleep with her.
 <br>
 No, Michael, no.
 <br>
 Set her up with fez.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the one who likes her.
 <br>
 Fez needs something, man.
 <br>
 Guy&#39;s so desperate, he&#39;s been rubbing himself around on the couch like a cat.
 <br>
 What you need to do is put &#39;em together in a romantic situation.
 <br>
 Suzy might not like fez at first, but he won&#39;t take &#34;no&#34; for an answer.
 <br>
 He&#39;s like one freaky, horny little dude.
 <br>
 Just ask the couch.
 <br>
 Hey, I was thinking maybe tomorrow you could help me brush up on my target practice.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a date.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ll be there.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll be there.
 <br>
 On a date.
 <br>
 So I&#39;ll see you at the shooting range.
 <br>
 For our date.
 <br>
 Your first date with Suzy&#39;s all set up, and she told me that she&#39;s crazy about you.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m surprised, but I&#39;m a little crazy about me, too.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s all set.
 <br>
 Fez is going on a date with Suzy, who&#39;s going on a date with me and doesn&#39;t know she&#39;s going on a date with fez.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ready for our date, Michael.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ready for our date, Suzy.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah! ? it&#39;s such a shame you won&#39;t be able to film anymore.
 <br>
 Look, there&#39;s one last exercise I want to try Role-playing.
 <br>
 All right, come on.
 <br>
 All right, now you&#39;re going to be Eric.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re going to be your father.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, you can start.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m just a skinny Smart-mouthed kid who always has something to say about everything.
 <br>
 And I wish I was an octopus.
 <br>
 So I could put eight feet in eight different asses.
 <br>
 &#34;Star wars.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Star wars.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Star wars&#34;! Dead commies! Dead commies! Dead commies! All right, hold it.
 <br>
 Time out.
 <br>
 Time out.
 <br>
 I think I know what the problem is.
 <br>
 All right, fine.
 <br>
 I drink a little.
 <br>
 What? I have a very difficult job, and I come home at night, and, well Drinks are her nightly reward.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I believe the source of your husband&#39;s stress is Oh, here it comes.
 <br>
 Your son! Him? Me? It&#39;s not me? Oh, boy! You think my problem is my own son? My son is a fine young man.
 <br>
 Oh, dad, you don&#39;t have Shut up, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 You know less about my family than you do about football, which isn&#39;t saying much since you dropped every pass that came near you.
 <br>
 And let me tell you something else When a real packer hurts his leg, he stuffs his kneecap back in and keeps on running! That&#39;s what this little mushroom would have done.
 <br>
 ? I love this place The sweet smell of gunpowder, the deafening boom of shotgun blasts.
 <br>
 Oops, that kind of talk is more appropriate for the bedroom.
 <br>
 I apologize.
 <br>
 Knock.
 <br>
 Knock.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s there? Ivan.
 <br>
 Ivan who? I&#39;ve an awful lot of candy for the both of us.
 <br>
 Fez? Well, if it&#39;s not me, then there&#39;s some lucky bastard who looks just like me.
 <br>
 Michael, I thought it was just gonna be you, me, and a box of hot lead.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s even better.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you, me, and a box of hot fez.
 <br>
 Kelso, this wasn&#39;t part of the deal.
 <br>
 What wasn&#39;t part of the deal? You! So beat it.
 <br>
 I want her to smell nothing but me.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? I&#39;m kind of in the way.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go next door, and maybe you can show fez how to shoot.
 <br>
 Try to close the deal before she realizes you&#39;re a foreigner.
 <br>
 So where do we start? I could rifle through the manual, but why don&#39;t you just give me the bullet points? Fez, I never joke about guns.
 <br>
 OhShoot.
 <br>
 I have no discipline.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna just take aim and squeeze gently.
 <br>
 Squeebee-geegee.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Put these on and take a few shots.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just gonna go check on Michael.
 <br>
 So he&#39;s not alone.
 <br>
 Cologne? Oh, yeah, I mixed a bunch of different ones, and, you know, I make my own scent.
 <br>
 Hey, Michael.
 <br>
 Do you want me to hold your shoulders while you shoot or maybe square off your thighs? You know whose thighs need squaring off? Fez&#39;s.
 <br>
 Yeah, bad.
 <br>
 Oh, and by the way, he also told me that he thinks you&#39;re really nice.
 <br>
 Oh, well, he&#39;s nice, too.
 <br>
 And now that I can understand some of what he&#39;s saying, he&#39;s kind of charming.
 <br>
 Oh, look, a rabbit.
 <br>
 I love animals.
 <br>
 You know who really loves animals? Fez.
 <br>
 He does? Yeah.
 <br>
 The bunny! I got dinner! ? and then my dad actually gave me a compliment &#34;My son&#39;s a fine young man.
 <br>
 &#34; That&#39;s like the most loving thing he said to me since he told me that I could be worse.
 <br>
 Are you sure red was talking about you? I mean, I love you, but you are a little high-maintenance.
 <br>
 And not in a good way like me.
 <br>
 Remember when it took red all summer to teach you how to catch a ball &#39;cause you were too scared of it? First, red had him look at a picture of a ball.
 <br>
 Then he put him in a room with a ball.
 <br>
 And then he moves him closer until he wasn&#39;t screaming being right next to the ball.
 <br>
 What is so scary about a ball? People throw it right at you, okay? I&#39;m sorry about what I did to that poor bunny.
 <br>
 I guess my gun really had a hare trigger, huh? Too soon? Yes, too soon.
 <br>
 Well, I apologize for ruining our first date.
 <br>
 Our first date? No, I was there on a date with Michael.
 <br>
 What? No, no, he told me we were on a date.
 <br>
 He told me we were on a date.
 <br>
 You and me &#34;we&#34; or he and you &#34;we&#34;? I think one of us has been lied to and the other one, too.
 <br>
 Well, then you should be very angry, which means I am, too! Hey, why don&#39;t you two kiss and make up? Michael, what kind of game are you playing, inviting me on a date that wasn&#39;t with you? Yeah, I second that, but about her.
 <br>
 And add, &#34;you son of bitch.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay, look, I have a really good explanation for this, but I left it at home.
 <br>
 Oh, dad.
 <br>
 Uh, about what you said to the stress management guy I just wanted to say thanks.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You said it.
 <br>
 We&#39;re both embarrassed.
 <br>
 Now move along.
 <br>
 No, I mean Look, I could be a little less of a smart-ass.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re my father.
 <br>
 Your life matters to me.
 <br>
 So anyway, dad, I Eric, if you say, &#34;I love you,&#34; my heart is going to explode.
 <br>
 Ah, kitty, uh, what&#39;s for dinner? Well, the camera&#39;s off, so I&#39;m having a Margarita with salt.
 <br>
 You two are on your own.
 <br>
 Kelso So this is where you go after a hard day of screwing me over! All right, look, fez, I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 Zip it, fool! You stole my girl, and I really need a girl.
 <br>
 Here, fez.
 <br>
 You&#39;re probably gonna want some personal time with the couch.
 <br>
 I even plumped up the pillows for you.
 <br>
 No, I cannot be in the same room with him.
 <br>
 You and I are through.
 <br>
 Now good day.
 <br>
 But, fez Fez, he said, &#34;but, fez&#34; Oh, I heard him.
 <br>
 Well, now you&#39;re supposed to say &#34;I say good day.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah, and then we all know that you&#39;re really mad, but eventually, you&#39;ll get over it.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;d like that.
 <br>
 Dance, monkey, dance.
 <br>
 Oh, kelso, this monkey don&#39;t dance no more.
 <br>
 But, fez I said good day! Arrrh! Oh, fez, it was so nice of you to make dinner for us.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is amazing.
 <br>
 Well, food always tastes better when it&#39;s fresh.
 <br>
 So what is this anyway? Well, let&#39;s just say that the Easter bunny came early this year, so I shot him.
 <br>
