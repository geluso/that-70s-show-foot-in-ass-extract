<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 hey, sarah, when you and donna are alone at the radio station, do you ever pretend that instead of being just a regular intern, that you&#39;re, like, a super naughty intern ? Oh, and that donna has to teach you a very naked lesson ? I&#39;ll give you 10 bucks and what&#39;s left of my hot dog to say yes.
 <br>
 No, sillies.
 <br>
 There&#39;s way too much work to do at the station to daydream.
 <br>
 I mean, I have to take my top off and sort records, and then donna and i have to french-kiss.
 <br>
 It&#39;s exhausting.
 <br>
 This is why there should be more women in the workforce.
 <br>
 Um, please don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but I want to have sex with you.
 <br>
 Sarah&#39;s only been interning for a week, but the deejays have already let her talk on the air, and they gave her a really cool nickname &#34;sizzling sarah.
 <br>
 &#34; - Oh, that&#39;s terrific ! That&#39;s onomatopoeia.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 It rhymes.
 <br>
 It is so fun.
 <br>
 Everyone at the station&#39;s been super nice, especially the older men.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 This girl is great.
 <br>
 This girl is great ! That girl is a bitch.
 <br>
 She&#39;s sizzling sarah in one week ? It took me six months of sorting records to become &#34;hot donna&#34; six months.
 <br>
 Uh, no, actually, you&#39;ve been hot donna since the fifth grade when you started cultivating that melon patch.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t tell her about the melon patch ! Now she knows our secret code ! Sizzling sarah.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even know why they hired her.
 <br>
 She&#39;s music-illiterate.
 <br>
 When I asked her if she liked the police, she was like,&#34;no, I prefer firemen.
 <br>
 &#34; Donna, who cares if she knows about music ? The girl is freakin&#39; hot ! Yeah, donna, what you&#39;ve yet to realize is that life is a beauty contest.
 <br>
 I mean, you got your job because you&#39;re hot, and now a new hot girl is coming and taking your place.
 <br>
 It&#39;s survival of the juggiest.
 <br>
 No, I got my job because I know music.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s why your on-air nickname is &#34;music-knowing donna.
 <br>
 &#34; Look, donna, your problem is you&#39;ve got too much going on.
 <br>
 I mean, the less you have going on, the less you have to worry about.
 <br>
 Look at me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got nothing going on, and I&#39;ve got nothing to worry about.
 <br>
 Except your future.
 <br>
 Eh.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going ? Horrible ! I want you back ! Thank god ! I want you back ! In fact, marry me ! Oh, yes, steven ! Do you, jackie ? - I do ! - Me too ! Whoo-hoo ! Yeah, baby ! jackie, I said, &#34;how&#39;s it going ?&#34; Fine.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 You guys, while I was in the bathroom, I realized I totally forgot to wear a bra today.
 <br>
 I love you.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 15 &#34;It&#39;s All Over&#34; Steven, I&#39;ve noticed that every day you come home from the record store tired and irritable, and I just want to say, welcome to life.
 <br>
 So what&#39;s new in the world of rock and roll ? &#39;Cause this cool cat wants the skinny on the be-bop, maestro.
 <br>
 Uh, well, tomorrow we have tom jones coming in for a record signing at the store.
 <br>
 Tom jones ? I love him ! Oh, and the way he shakes his hips ! It just makes me feel all nervous and embarrassed.
 <br>
 Boy, that sounds like fun.
 <br>
 Fun for you, maybe.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a middle-aged woman.
 <br>
 What ? Don&#39;t &#34;what&#34; me.
 <br>
 The average lifespan is 72, so if you&#39;re older than 36, which you are, then by definition, you&#39;re middle-aged.
 <br>
 Discussion over.
 <br>
 Okay, when you&#39;re right, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I win an argument every six years or so.
 <br>
 Is, um, steven here ? I&#39;m only asking to make sure he&#39;s not in case he still has feelings for me.
 <br>
 Well, he&#39;s not here.
 <br>
 He went to a bar to forget how much he loves you.
 <br>
 Really ? Uh, no, he&#39;s at the car wash.
 <br>
 You guys want to hear something sick ? Ooh, yes.
 <br>
 Please, hurry.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Randall down at the radio station wants me to host a live remote from hyde&#39;s record store when tom jones is there.
 <br>
 And to promote it, they want to put me on a billboard wearing this.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just good radio.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not wearing it.
 <br>
 I should be valued for my voice and music knowledge, not my body, no matter how smokin&#39; it is.
 <br>
 There you go again with your &#34;women should be valued for their minds&#34; gobbledygook.
 <br>
 Donna, women should be valued for their looks.
 <br>
 Men should be valued for their cars, and foreigners should be valued for their ability to sweep.
 <br>
 Hey, hey ! We also drive a mean taxi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not caving to their smutty demands.
 <br>
 I am an on-air personality.
 <br>
 I am not a sex kitten.
 <br>
 I agree, donna.
 <br>
 Making you wear that outfit is demeaning to women.
 <br>
 Well, thank you, fez.
 <br>
 But just to be sure, put it on and shake your ass.
 <br>
 would you please quit giggling ? Sorry, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m listening to george carlin&#39;s &#34;seven dirty words you can&#39;t say on radio and television.
 <br>
 &#34; Man, he just keeps saying &#39;em over and over again.
 <br>
 potty mouth.
 <br>
 Okay, tom jones is booked, and everything is set.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything more exciting than a promotional event gone right.
 <br>
 Then you need to get drunk and ride a mechanical bull.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;re being more of a tool than usual.
 <br>
 Have you talked to jackie ? No, angie.
 <br>
 What do I have to say to jackie ? That you love her and miss her.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t love people.
 <br>
 I love camaros, zeppelin and french fries, in that order.
 <br>
 you guys, I just had this brilliant idea.
 <br>
 You know how every dirty word has a number ? Instead of cursing, you could just say that number.
 <br>
 Like, I could say,&#34;hi, go three yourself.
 <br>
 &#34; Hey, angie.
 <br>
 When tom jones gets here, you&#39;re not gonna throw your underpants at him, are you ? Michael, you know I don&#39;t wear underwear.
 <br>
 Come on, man, you&#39;re my sister.
 <br>
 I just told her to say that to gross you out.
 <br>
 Burn ! Yeah, you got me.
 <br>
 Besides, I happen to know that she does wear underwear.
 <br>
 Sometimes she lets me take &#39;em off for her.
 <br>
 Boomerang burn ! Oh, I feel terrible.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s the flu.
 <br>
 Okay, now is this the real flu or the martini &amp; rossiasti spumante ? Now I&#39;m gonna miss tom jones this afternoon, and I wanted his autograph so badly.
 <br>
 - Red, I was thinking maybe - no.
 <br>
 You know, if you were sick, and joe dimaggio was signing footballs, I&#39;d get an autograph for you.
 <br>
 Mom, joe dimaggio played baseball.
 <br>
 that&#39;d be like me saying G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe has a karate grip.
 <br>
 What a nerd I&#39;d be.
 <br>
 Hey, fez, I need your advice.
 <br>
 You should show more leg.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 Look, I still love steven, and I want him back.
 <br>
 Everything reminds me of him.
 <br>
 Every time I walk past a pile of dirty laundry, I start crying.
 <br>
 Well, then you should go to him and tell him how you feel.
 <br>
 I cannot go up to steven and pour my heart out to him if I&#39;m not sure he feels the same way.
 <br>
 I couldn&#39;t take the rejection.
 <br>
 Oh, please, I&#39;ve been rejected a million times.
 <br>
 And trust me, after the first hundred or so, they don&#39;t sting no more, baby.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t even know what to say.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s role-play.
 <br>
 Pretend I&#39;m hyde, and then say everything you want to say to him to me.
 <br>
 Really ? Okay.
 <br>
 Steven, I love you, and I want you back.
 <br>
 I never thought I would hear those words, my darling.
 <br>
 Ew ! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I got a little carried away.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be serious this time, I promise.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I love you, and all I want is for us to be together.
 <br>
 Oh, get off me, weirdo ! I&#39;m the weirdo ? You&#39;re the one saying,&#34;I love you,&#34; smack ! &#34;I love you,&#34; smack ! You little tease ! So you see, mr.
 <br>
 Randall, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for me to wear a bikini.
 <br>
 I mean, what is sexier than a little bit of mystery ? Well, according to my research, naked boobies.
 <br>
 All right, look, ratings are down, and I think this could really help.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not gonna strip for a radio advertisement.
 <br>
 It&#39;s demeaning.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 You will ? Yeah, of course she&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 This whole billboard was her idea.
 <br>
 What ? Unlike some people, I care about this radio station.
 <br>
 Plus, I just love wearing a bikini.
 <br>
 When I put one on, I jiggle just like jelly.
 <br>
 Well, she jiggles just like two perfectly filled water balloons, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll never get to see them or touch them or make a motorboat sound with your mouth between them, because she is a lady ! Sarah, you knew that I would never do this.
 <br>
 You were just trying to make me look bad.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s working.
 <br>
 You&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 Wait, you&#39;re firing me because I won&#39;t strip ? No, no, you know what ? I&#39;m a gentleman, and I normally don&#39;t use this kind of language.
 <br>
 But, mr.
 <br>
 Randall, you are one sixing, sevening monkey-fiver.
 <br>
 You think your one don&#39;t stink ? Well, three off, you threeing three ! ladies, ladies, I realize tom jones is late, and I have an announcement to make.
 <br>
 Shut up ! Holy crap ! It&#39;s like a water buffalo convention.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not waiting two hours for a lousy autograph.
 <br>
 Excuse me, excuse me.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Sorry, watch your feet.
 <br>
 Excuse me, excuse me.
 <br>
 Excuse me there, buddy.
 <br>
 Hey, no cutsies.
 <br>
 Oh, hell, I don&#39;t need Tom Jones.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll sign the damn album myself.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Who pinched my behind ? Bonnie ! Your husband hasn&#39;t even been dead two months ! I am freakin&#39; pissed.
 <br>
 Sarah puts on a bikini and whammo, she gets me fired ? That little bimbo set this whole thing up, and I am freakin&#39; pissed ! See what happens when you try to skate through life using your brain ? For the millionth time, people, it&#39;s all about the looks ! Well, I refuse to trade on my good looks to achieve success.
 <br>
 Eric forman don&#39;t play that game.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not gonna let her get away with this.
 <br>
 I need to think of a way to get even.
 <br>
 All right, you need to do something brilliant that&#39;s subtle but clever.
 <br>
 Hit her in the face with a wiffle ball bat.
 <br>
 Um, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m looking for.
 <br>
 Okay, then, well, you&#39;ve obviously never been hit in the face with a wiffle ball bat.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 Sarah&#39;s gonna be broadcasting live from the record store, right ? Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, then I got an awesome idea.
 <br>
 Well, if it&#39;s hitting her in the face with a wiffle ball bat, you stole that from me.
 <br>
 Here it is, kitty a signed tom jones album.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, thank you ! Oh, I hope he wasn&#39;t upsetI couldn&#39;t be there myself.
 <br>
 Did you tell him I had the flu ? Didn&#39;t come up.
 <br>
 Well, what did you talk about ? Fishing.
 <br>
 Tom jones fishes ? yeah, it&#39;s surprising, I know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so surprised that I&#39;m gonna go upstairs and take a nap.
 <br>
 this is sizzling sarah at grooves record store, coming at you live without a bra.
 <br>
 And up next, some music from a band.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - Okay ! I was thinking now would be a good time to put a bikini on.
 <br>
 Fortunately, I keep a box of &#39;em in my car.
 <br>
 Tom is two hours late.
 <br>
 These women are gonna rip this place apart.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve gotta think of some way to distract them.
 <br>
 What do you want me to do, throw a ham at them ? All right, all right, you should throw me at&#39;em.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give these ladies what they&#39;re not getting at home.
 <br>
 Okay, there&#39;s hyde.
 <br>
 Go and tell him you want him back.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I mean, if I knew he loved me, I&#39;d be happy to put myself out there.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t, and if he doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ll just feel so stupid.
 <br>
 Okay, just go to him and say, &#34;steven, I want to talk about us.
 <br>
 &#34; And if he wants to talk, then he wants you back.
 <br>
 But if he blows you off, then you tested the water, and the water, well, the water doesn&#39;t love you.
 <br>
 All right, here I go.
 <br>
 Hey, um, steven, can we talk about us ? Us ? Who has time to talk about us ? Oh, lady, you&#39;re not at home ! Put your shoes back on ! He didn&#39;t even want to talk to me.
 <br>
 Am I so disgusting ? Apparently to him.
 <br>
 Eric, are you sure this is gonna work ? Donna, let&#39;s just say when we&#39;re done with sizzling sarah, her new nickname&#39;s gonna be crying, no-job, street prostitute sarah.
 <br>
 Hi, sarah.
 <br>
 Hi, um, I just wanted to thank you for getting me fired.
 <br>
 I realize now that my feminist ideals are just a bunch of hooey, and I should use my brains less and my body more.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t know why women are given brains in the first place.
 <br>
 Anyway, um, mr.
 <br>
 Randall felt bad for me, so he hired me back as an intern, and he wants you to play this after the commercial, track six.
 <br>
 You know, donna, you and I are a lot alike, well, except I&#39;m on the radio, and you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Steven, tom jones is stuck in a snowstorm.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not coming.
 <br>
 These women will riot ! Yeah, when middle-aged women get mad, they get super pissed.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause they got nothing to lose.
 <br>
 They&#39;re almost dead.
 <br>
 Which is why we should have somebody else break the news.
 <br>
 Hey, fez, you want to meet some ladies ? Yeah ! Okay, I&#39;ve just been handed a hot new record, so here&#39;s george carlin with &#34;the seven dirty words you can&#39;t say on television or radio.
 <br>
 &#34; Huh, it seems like I almost shouldn&#39;t play it.
 <br>
 Oh, well ! Eric, thank you so much.
 <br>
 That was a great idea.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s go home and five all night.
 <br>
 So, steven, how was tom jones ? Who knows ? He never even wanted to leave.
 <br>
 Yeah, tom loves his fans.
 <br>
 I was just telling kitty how I had to chase down his limo to get her an autograph.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, it was fantastic.
 <br>
 You should have seen red running after tom&#39;s limo, screaming like a little girl.
 <br>
 &#34;tom, tom !&#34; All right, all right ! That&#39;s enough bragging.
 <br>
 Well, and that is why I am making this meatball hero for my meaty hero of a husband.
 <br>
 Hiya, red.
 <br>
 You were smart not to stick around.
 <br>
 I waited five hours.
 <br>
 Tom jones never showed up.
 <br>
 Never showed up ? If tom jones never showed up, who signed this autograph ? I can&#39;t lie to you.
 <br>
 It was julio iglesias.
 <br>
 Those women at the record store flipped when they heard the seven dirty words, especially word number four.
 <br>
 They do not like word number four.
 <br>
 it was awesome, man.
 <br>
 Sarah got fired.
 <br>
 The station manager got in trouble, and donna got her job back.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, if I weren&#39;t unemployed and living with my mommy, I&#39;d be wickedly cool.
 <br>
 Well, if you&#39;d have hit somebody in the face with a wiffle ball bat, this would have been over hours ago.
 <br>
 Okay, not only did I get my job back, but I had conditions.
 <br>
 I told mr.
 <br>
 Randall I&#39;d be fully clothed at all times, and he said okay.
 <br>
 I told him to stop demeaning women, and he said okay.
 <br>
 And I told him to respect me for my mind and my ideas and not my looks, and he said okay.
 <br>
 So do you want people to stop calling you &#34;hot donna&#34; ? No, that makes me feel pretty.
 <br>
 donna, you whore ! You got me fired ! Wait, you&#39;re the one who got me fired first.
 <br>
 Well, I am so mad, I&#39;m gonna make out with fez ! Well, if you&#39;re gonna make out with fez, then so am I ! No, sleep, damn you, sleep !
 <br>
