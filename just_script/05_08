<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 ( Stereo:Soft Rock ) I love this ring.
 <br>
 I wish we could tell people that we&#39;re engaged.
 <br>
 You know, without Red killing you.
 <br>
 Red kills happy things.
 <br>
 It&#39;s what he does.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just enjoy the fact that someday you are going to be Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman? ( Laughs ) You want me to go by Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman? Well, yeah, I just assumed.
 <br>
 I mean, come on.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Pinciotti? - Which is nice.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Which is really nice.
 <br>
 - ( Kitty ) Eric? Eric? Honey could you get the Thanksgiving turkey out of the freezer? Oh, wait.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a 20-pounder.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 Could you get the Thanksgiving turkey out of the freezer? Sure, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 See? There&#39;s your Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know- ( Clears Throat ) you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s gonna be a little creepy.
 <br>
 Well, now I kinda like it.
 <br>
 Call me Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s feeling dirty.
 <br>
 - Okay, Donna- - Come on.
 <br>
 Give Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman a big French kiss! No! Donna, no! ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) Okay.
 <br>
 Perfect.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all set for turkey day.
 <br>
 And there&#39;ll be plenty of room, especially without Laurie.
 <br>
 Has anyone heard from her? Of course not! I guess respect and courtesy aren&#39;t genetic like my slim hips.
 <br>
 Hey, Schotzie, stay away from my witch sister.
 <br>
 Her and her witch friends have been known to sacrifice small animals.
 <br>
 Oh, and possibly that one asthmatic neighbor boy.
 <br>
 Eric, little Wally moved away.
 <br>
 A six-year-old moved away? His parents still live in that house.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, if it helps, I can inviteJackie to Thanksgiving.
 <br>
 She&#39;s bitchy like Laurie.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I would love to come to your Thanksgiving dinner and I&#39;ll bring a date and a Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Red is gonna flip when he sees this failing notice.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;To the parent or guardian of Eric Forman.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Your son is a complete idiot.
 <br>
 Please kick him out and raise the foreign boy as your own.
 <br>
 Man, all I did was mess up on two math quizzes but Ms.
 <br>
 McGee has to be all- ( Whining ) I&#39;m Ms.
 <br>
 McGee.
 <br>
 I wear high heels and fail everybody.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that? That&#39;s Ms.
 <br>
 McGee.
 <br>
 You hardly changed your voice.
 <br>
 Well, sure, I did.
 <br>
 ( Whining ) I&#39;m Ms.
 <br>
 McGee.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just your voice.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m doing an impression.
 <br>
 - Well, you suck at impressions.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Forget it.
 <br>
 - Are you still doing her? Oh, hey, Red.
 <br>
 Do me a favor.
 <br>
 Sign this, huh? My gym teacher&#39;s failing me &#39;cause I won&#39;t wear shorts.
 <br>
 - Why won&#39;t you wear shorts? - Would you wear shorts? Fine.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 - So, Eric.
 <br>
 How&#39;s school treating you? You managing to, uh, keep from embarrassing yourself? Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, sure.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been buckling down just like you said and thinking a little bit more about my future which I believe you also recommended.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s good to know that 1 7 years of kicking your ass has finally paid off.
 <br>
 Eric, you didn&#39;t have him sign your failing notice.
 <br>
 Oh, I don&#39;t wanna trouble him with this old thing.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just sign his name myself, because that&#39;s how good a son I am.
 <br>
 ( Man Singing Blues Rock ) ( Gobbling ) Okay, careful.
 <br>
 Careful.
 <br>
 Watch the TV.
 <br>
 Okay, this is good.
 <br>
 Perfect.
 <br>
 Perfect.
 <br>
 You.
 <br>
 Why are you here? You don&#39;t even know what Thanksgiving is.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here because my host parents are feeding bums at church.
 <br>
 Charity begins at home, my ass.
 <br>
 ( Doorbell Rings ) - Laurie.
 <br>
 - Hey, little brother.
 <br>
 You&#39;re back.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re not even eight months pregnant.
 <br>
 - Mommy! - Laurie.
 <br>
 ! ( Laughs ) Oh, my goodness! I knew you&#39;d come.
 <br>
 - Hi, Daddy! - All the phones broken in Chicago? No.
 <br>
 Well, see, I had other plans but my date- I mean, business associate- had to go be with his wife.
 <br>
 I mean, other business associate.
 <br>
 I&#39;m doin&#39; good! Okay, well, you know what? I&#39;m gonna set you a place right next to me at the big table.
 <br>
 No, Kitty.
 <br>
 I think that seat belongs to Eric.
 <br>
 Me? At the adults&#39; table? Are you sure I&#39;m ready? - But, Daddy- - Maybe before you leave you&#39;ll be acting a little more like him.
 <br>
 Yeah! ( Laughing ) I&#39;m the favorite now.
 <br>
 Ooh! Taste that.
 <br>
 Pimp gave ya the holiday off, huh? Yeah.
 <br>
 He replaced me with your mom.
 <br>
 Now it&#39;s Thanksgiving.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 You know how my dad&#39;s proud of me - for doing so well in school? - Even though it&#39;s a lie, and you&#39;re failing math - &#39;cause you spend all your time with me? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s- That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Well,just now, right now, right in there, right now Red asked me to sit at the grown-ups&#39; table.
 <br>
 Wow! I hear each person over there gets their own biscuit.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Donna, it&#39;s glorious.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 Donna, I want to tell everyone we&#39;re engaged.
 <br>
 Tonight.
 <br>
 Tonight? Are you sure? Yeah, I just- I just want everyone to know, you know? So when the moment&#39;s right we&#39;ll just-we&#39;ll tell &#39;em all.
 <br>
 This is so awesome! And then,just in case, we&#39;ll run like hell.
 <br>
 - I probably won&#39;t wait for you.
 <br>
 - Oh, okay.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a beautiful table, Kitty.
 <br>
 Well, thank you, Daddy.
 <br>
 So glad that you and Mom could be here.
 <br>
 Well, we have to eat somewhere.
 <br>
 And, Mom, I know that we have had our ups and downs but in honor of this special day I would like to tell you that I am thankful that you are my mother, and I love you.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t there something you would like to tell me? Actually, I would like some more tea.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll try and slip some booze in there in the interest of a happy holiday.
 <br>
 So, Thanksgiving.
 <br>
 We celebrate the subjugation of an indigenous people with yams and Underdog floats.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m mostly celebrating my pretty new dress.
 <br>
 And so much for talking.
 <br>
 May I wet your whistle, grandpa? Gonna have to say yes to that.
 <br>
 Well, cannot let this go to waste.
 <br>
 When did they get a houseboy? ( Pounding ) Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 This is my date Carol.
 <br>
 Ms.
 <br>
 McGee? Kelso you&#39;re dating my math teacher? No.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not dating.
 <br>
 We just have a relationship that I thought we agreed to keep a secret? Well, um, welcome.
 <br>
 Michael, she is 1 0 years older than you.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 Nine and five-twelfths.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) She taught me that.
 <br>
 - Ooh! - Very good, Michael.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Kelso, how could you bring her? Oh, relax, man.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not going to quiz you or anything.
 <br>
 But if she does, the square root of zero is zero.
 <br>
 She got me with that last night, earned herself a free massage.
 <br>
 Um, Ms.
 <br>
 McGee, being that it&#39;s a holiday and all there are certain math-related failing-type things I&#39;d rather not talk about.
 <br>
 I hear you.
 <br>
 There are certain things I&#39;d like to keep quiet too.
 <br>
 So if anyone from the school board should ask I came alone, and I left before dessert.
 <br>
 Eric, maybe we should wait on the big announcement now that your math teacher is here.
 <br>
 Oh, no, Donna.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t have to worry &#39;cause she&#39;s not my math teacher today.
 <br>
 Today she&#39;s a cradle-robbing slut.
 <br>
 - Yea, student-teacher relationships! - Yea! Hey, Laurie.
 <br>
 Long time no doin&#39; it.
 <br>
 Maybe for you.
 <br>
 So, what time is your date gonna let you out for recess? Nice try, Laurie.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no recess today.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Thanksgiving! Wow, Laurie.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Yeah, me and her really had something, huh? Yeah.
 <br>
 Ointment took care of that, though, right? Yeah.
 <br>
 ( Chattering ) This looks great.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 One for Burt and one for Ernie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m calling you Ernie now because you look like the Muppet.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t ask for a drink.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t ask to be born in a field.
 <br>
 But you fought back against adversity just like your Indian brothers.
 <br>
 What is he, Cherokee? ( Singsongy ) Gobble, gobble, gobble.
 <br>
 It&#39;s time to carve the turkey.
 <br>
 ( Giggling ) Red.
 <br>
 Actually, Kitty, I think this is Eric&#39;s year.
 <br>
 Seems like he&#39;s growing up and finally buckling down.
 <br>
 Here you go, Son.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, in that case, I would like to make a kind of announcement.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 ! I&#39;m bread man.
 <br>
 Shut up! Eric&#39;s talking.
 <br>
 Go ahead, honey.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m really glad that my family&#39;s here and my friends and, well, even my math teacher.
 <br>
 Because, uh, something happened a few days ago that I&#39;d like to share with everyone.
 <br>
 Eric, we agreed this isn&#39;t the time.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No, I meant- - Not the time for what? To talk about how he&#39;s failing math.
 <br>
 - What? - Fez, what the hell? I&#39;ve been drinking.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, you did sign the failing notice.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t sign- You forged my name? Wow.
 <br>
 I really picked the right day to come home, huh? Okay, um who likes dark meat? Hey, who doesn&#39;t? Am I right, ladies? Oh, Lord.
 <br>
 So you lied to me about school.
 <br>
 Now, it wasn&#39;t a lie so much as a misdirection, really.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll talk about this later.
 <br>
 Well, Laurie, looks like a seat just opened up for you.
 <br>
 Come on over and grab a biscuit.
 <br>
 Forty-two minutes and I&#39;m back on top.
 <br>
 So, that was kind of a mess.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I wanted to happen.
 <br>
 Burt, honey, pass me your plate.
 <br>
 Burtikins.
 <br>
 - Burt! - I&#39;m up.
 <br>
 Bob, you know what Eric&#39;s problem is? All that time he&#39;s spending with your daughter.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna ain&#39;t the problem.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s the one who corrupted her up so dirty, I had to send her to Catholic school.
 <br>
 How could he be failing math? Kitty, I&#39;m sure he did the best he could.
 <br>
 For someone who was held too long as a baby.
 <br>
 I bet that explains why he hit puberty so late too.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 That was because of your mother&#39;s smoking.
 <br>
 Fez, I know you&#39;ve only spoken English for a couple weeks now, but could you have learned the words, &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t tell my dad&#39;&#39;? &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t,&#39;&#39; a contraction meaning &#39;&#39;do not&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;tell my dad,&#39;&#39; meaning shut up? Okay, right there, you just told me not to shut up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a wonder you&#39;re not failing English too.
 <br>
 Crack a book, you lazy son of a bitch.
 <br>
 So, guys Ms.
 <br>
 McGee.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Pretty nice, huh? If they put one of her in every classroom I&#39;d never skip school again, if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m doin&#39; it with my teacher! Oh, shh! It&#39;s a secret.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never been with a teacher.
 <br>
 But I was with the post-office lady.
 <br>
 That was cool.
 <br>
 I got a hundred free stamps and a monster roll of tape.
 <br>
 I like older women.
 <br>
 They always got something smart to say.
 <br>
 ( Stereo:Soft Rock ) I think I could probably fit inside of a record player.
 <br>
 That&#39;s gotta sound good in there.
 <br>
 Inside of a record player? I miss dating Kelso.
 <br>
 The guys I&#39;m with now, they&#39;re so- I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the word? Married.
 <br>
 Hey, you and Kelso didn&#39;t date.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just a tramp he cheated with.
 <br>
 And you contaminated him so much, I ended up with Steven who I love being with.
 <br>
 So thank you.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the only one here who&#39;s never been with Kelso.
 <br>
 Which makes me wanna say, &#39;&#39;Ew!&#39;&#39; And also, &#39;&#39;Thank God.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; But you, I mean, you&#39;re a teacher.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t you get in trouble for dating a student? Hey, let &#39;em come and get me.
 <br>
 He&#39;s 1 8.
 <br>
 I make $1 1 ,000 a year.
 <br>
 I deserve a little something.
 <br>
 So, that was one rootin&#39;-tootin&#39; big, old crap of a day, huh? Yep.
 <br>
 Pretty much.
 <br>
 I just really wanted to tell people that we were engaged.
 <br>
 Know what? Maybe it&#39;d be easier if we just showed up next Thanksgiving with a kid.
 <br>
 Hey, thanks for dinner, Kitty.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll remember to wear my stretch pants next time.
 <br>
 Oh, let me know if you find that button.
 <br>
 Good night.
 <br>
 I apologize if my being here upset you.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 I- I just feel you being seen out with a student is- it&#39;s just awfully bad principle.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t care.
 <br>
 He&#39;s dating a cheerleader.
 <br>
 Burt.
 <br>
 Burtie Bear.
 <br>
 - Burt! - Grandma, let me.
 <br>
 - Grandpa! - I&#39;m up! My goodness, you are going to make some lucky man a wonderful wife! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where Laurie gets her mean streak.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not from delightful me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s from my evil mother! So evil skips a generation.
 <br>
 So that means that my granddaughter is gonna be the devil.
 <br>
 Well, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 Because no woman&#39;s gonna wanna bear your idiot kids if you can&#39;t even pass math.
 <br>
 How could you forge my signature? - Here comes yelling.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna hear this.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll help with the dishes.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll take these half-empty glasses.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve had enough.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 What the hell is wrong with you? He doesn&#39;t understand consequences, Daddy.
 <br>
 Well, maybe he&#39;ll understand this.
 <br>
 From now on, every time you disobey me or lie to me or do anything that pisses me off you&#39;re gonna pay me money.
 <br>
 Pay you? Wait, you&#39;re fining me? It&#39;s like giving him tickets for being dumb.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 I think we&#39;re forgetting about a time-tested punishment.
 <br>
 There&#39;s your foot.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s my ass.
 <br>
 Swing away.
 <br>
 Well, it obviously doesn&#39;t work.
 <br>
 So, for forging my name you owe me 30 bucks.
 <br>
 Daddy, can I borrow $30? - Sure, kitten.
 <br>
 - Wha- Laurie, your grandparents are sleeping in your room.
 <br>
 So you take Eric&#39;s room, and the math whiz can ride the couch.
 <br>
 Well, another Thanksgiving come and gone.
 <br>
 Certainly an eventful day, hmm? Yeah.
 <br>
 But with our ungrateful daughter that dumb-ass son and a drunk foreign kid, I&#39;d say actually, it was a little better than last year.
 <br>
 - I know we&#39;re young.
 <br>
 - But we&#39;re totally in love.
 <br>
 And we just want you to know - we&#39;re engaged! - We&#39;re engaged! - Feels good to tell someone.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I think they&#39;re happy for us.
 <br>
 Look, Schotzie&#39;s celebrating.
