<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 You know, we never had waffles at my house.
 <br>
 My mom always said a waffle iron was a luxury.
 <br>
 Like pillow cases or not getting hit.
 <br>
 Man, this is so cool.
 <br>
 You are welcome, Steven.
 <br>
 See, Eric, I told you I was cool.
 <br>
 Eric, did you tell your mother that she&#39;s not cool? - What? Well - Stop telling your mother she&#39;s not cool.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Mom, you&#39;re super fly.
 <br>
 Thanks, honey.
 <br>
 Steven, would you like maple syrup or blueberry syrup? You have syrup? - Man, I love it here.
 <br>
 - And we love having you here, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like the brother I never had.
 <br>
 I mean, I have a sister, but I hate her.
 <br>
 So, this is great.
 <br>
 Eric, after breakfast I want you to rake the yard.
 <br>
 - Rake? But, Dad, I was gonna - I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven.
 <br>
 My God I love my new brother! Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Kitty, look who&#39;s back in town.
 <br>
 My God Bull MacCrakin.
 <br>
 I thought you were in Chicago.
 <br>
 Nope.
 <br>
 I came back to Point Place to steal you away from this old S-O-B.
 <br>
 Bull, you still with Wendy? No.
 <br>
 I got married.
 <br>
 Wendy was a couple dozen ladies ago.
 <br>
 Now, boy, that is a lot of ladies.
 <br>
 You remember when our destroyer got strafed and you got four chunks of hot shrapnel right in the knee? Five.
 <br>
 I still limp when it rains.
 <br>
 - Yeah, great times.
 <br>
 - The greatest.
 <br>
 It is popping.
 <br>
 Help me.
 <br>
 It is popping in my mouth.
 <br>
 Fez, they&#39;re Pop Rocks, okay? That&#39;s what they do.
 <br>
 They pop.
 <br>
 Jackie, you know what would be cool to do with these in your mouth? Donna, look, everyone&#39;s here.
 <br>
 And I thought we&#39;d be all alone.
 <br>
 Phew.
 <br>
 I get it.
 <br>
 They want to make out.
 <br>
 For her pleasure.
 <br>
 If I cannot watch them make out, can I watch you two make out? - Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 - Michael! I mean, no, Fez.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know about you but McHale&#39;s Navy makes me feel extra sexy.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Take it outside.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got to do my homework, Frenchie.
 <br>
 Good one.
 <br>
 Now get out.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 Your mom just found out I failed a test.
 <br>
 - Did she yell at you? - No.
 <br>
 She said she was really disappointed.
 <br>
 And then, before I knew what I was doing, I told her I&#39;d try harder.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Now, here I brought you a sandwich to help you study.
 <br>
 - Thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Eric, Steven is studying.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t bother him.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you and Donna go up to your bedroom? Okay.
 <br>
 I mean, no.
 <br>
 Bad idea.
 <br>
 Just go outside to a well-lit supervised area and talk politely like decent young adults.
 <br>
 That sounds super, Mom.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a crazy idea.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you do the dishes, Bob? Why don&#39;t I do the dishes? I work all day.
 <br>
 I meditate all day.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you meditate over the sink and wash the dishes? Donna, will you tell your father he&#39;s a jackass? Donna, your mother was fine until she met those feminists and started thinking.
 <br>
 Excuse me, Bob.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not happy! Really? Well, I&#39;m ecstatic! You better watch out, Eric.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause it&#39;s all fun when you&#39;re making out on the couch but then they get bigger and bitchier! No offense, honey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna get bitchier, are you? Shut up.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Bull, I can&#39;t believe you finally settled down with a nice girl.
 <br>
 He may have settled down all right, but I&#39;m not that nice.
 <br>
 Red, I noticed in the paper that your plant&#39;s closing down.
 <br>
 Yeah, you can&#39;t compete with those damn foreign cars.
 <br>
 I tell you, if I&#39;d seen this coming I&#39;d have shot a little straighter during the war.
 <br>
 You know I&#39;m opening another hot tub store right here in Point Place.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, you&#39;ve always got a job with me if you want it.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, though, Bull.
 <br>
 You know this thing&#39;s pretty hot.
 <br>
 That jet just hit me right in the keister.
 <br>
 Yeah, believe it or not, some people like that.
 <br>
 Wanna ease back on the hooch there? You&#39;re getting a little loose.
 <br>
 I am just happy.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like a bath.
 <br>
 Only it&#39;s outside.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun! You got a real nice setup here.
 <br>
 - I sure do like that Corvette of yours.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I baby that thing.
 <br>
 Remember when we got back from Korea, we were both gonna buy them? Yeah.
 <br>
 I never did get that Corvette.
 <br>
 Got two kids instead.
 <br>
 - Kids.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I sure did want that Corvette.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re done cleaning the garage.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s play some ball.
 <br>
 Hang on, man.
 <br>
 I gotta take out the trash.
 <br>
 You know, Hyde, seeing you work hard and take pride in what you do I lost a lot of respect for you, man.
 <br>
 You used to be my hero.
 <br>
 My lazy American hero.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t listen to them, Hyde.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s great you&#39;re doing all my chores.
 <br>
 Eric, great job on the garage.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Hyde did it.
 <br>
 Yeah, I should have known.
 <br>
 It&#39;s actually clean.
 <br>
 - Nice going.
 <br>
 - Thanks, Red.
 <br>
 - What did you do? - I love you.
 <br>
 Well, I love you, too.
 <br>
 Dinner, kids.
 <br>
 Okay, now, that was Bull on the phone and he has invited us to a party on Saturday night.
 <br>
 Yeah? What&#39;s wrong? It&#39;s just that I look at what Bull has, and I look at what I have and I wonder if I made a few wrong turns, Kitty.
 <br>
 Maybe you&#39;ll get a fresh start working for Bull.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, I fought for my country.
 <br>
 I deserve a Corvette.
 <br>
 Okay, here we all are.
 <br>
 So, honey, how did you do on your history paper? History not being I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I was talking to Steven.
 <br>
 I must say, all that studying really paid off.
 <br>
 Yeah? What did you get? A &#34;D&#34;? No.
 <br>
 A &#34;C&#34; minus.
 <br>
 Way to go.
 <br>
 I got a &#34;B.
 <br>
 &#34; You couldn&#39;t get an &#34;A&#34;? Honey, don&#39;t listen to your father.
 <br>
 You did super.
 <br>
 And, Steven, you did super-duper.
 <br>
 Why does he get a &#34;duper&#34;? Because we expect more from you.
 <br>
 Give me a break, Forman.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have a mommy.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t sweat it, Eric.
 <br>
 You can only be as smart as God made you.
 <br>
 Or didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 All right, didn&#39;t you just flunk out of college? - Get bent, twerp.
 <br>
 - Wear a bra! Can we please not fight? &#34;Can we please not fight?&#34; Can you please not suck? - Good one, Eric.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 All right, everybody shut up.
 <br>
 Now, we&#39;re gonna have a nice dinner.
 <br>
 Eric, you try to be more like Steven.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Hyde? - Mom and Dad are giving him a bath.
 <br>
 - Bath? No, really.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, who cares.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m watching TV.
 <br>
 I hate you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just jealous, right? Because you&#39;re not number one anymore.
 <br>
 If I&#39;m not number one, guess who&#39;s number three? So your parents have brought a new bundle of joy into your home.
 <br>
 And you might feel like your parents don&#39;t love you anymore.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 They simply love you less.
 <br>
 You see, your parents only have so much love to go around.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s how your parents&#39;love was distributed before the new arrival.
 <br>
 And here it is after.
 <br>
 But what can you do about it? Well, you could run away.
 <br>
 As if they&#39;d come and look for you.
 <br>
 Say, here&#39;s something you can do.
 <br>
 Think of all the good times you&#39;ve had with your family.
 <br>
 Because they&#39;re all over now.
 <br>
 Okay, here we go.
 <br>
 Scotch rocks.
 <br>
 Scotch rocks.
 <br>
 And a mango margarita.
 <br>
 He was in the National Guard.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 You know, I almost forgot.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna need your car keys.
 <br>
 - How drunk do you think I&#39;m gonna get? - Hopefully, drunk enough.
 <br>
 My wife&#39;s got my keys.
 <br>
 You know, Bull, if you were serious, I&#39;ll take that job.
 <br>
 You got it.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be just like old times.
 <br>
 I mean, except for the killing.
 <br>
 Midge, I need my keys.
 <br>
 Sharon, hi.
 <br>
 - Honey, you remember Sharon.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Sharon, is it? You are so funny.
 <br>
 How do you keep your hands off him? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I just do.
 <br>
 So my parents are fighting all the time and they want me to choose sides.
 <br>
 But I can&#39;t because they&#39;re both idiots.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I mean, I really think they&#39;re gonna get a divorce.
 <br>
 My God, Donna, I am so sorry.
 <br>
 But you know what? That very thing happened to a good friend of mine and now she has twice as much stuff and twice as much clothes.
 <br>
 And her parents even fought over who got to buy her a car.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re right, Jackie.
 <br>
 This divorce thing could actually work to my advantage.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 Yeah, I just have to make it very clear that my love is contingent on how much they buy me.
 <br>
 Why am I even talking to you about this? You have a great handle on it.
 <br>
 Excuse me Jackie, when exactly did you lose your soul? Cheerleading camp.
 <br>
 You almost done there, Hazel? See, that&#39;s funny &#39;cause Hazel is a maid.
 <br>
 - Or you could have called him Alice, too.
 <br>
 - Shut up, Fez.
 <br>
 So, pretty tough with that scrubber in your hand? Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 Hyde, Red and Kitty aren&#39;t even here.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re kissing phantom butt.
 <br>
 You know what, Forman? I used to think Red was a real hard-ass.
 <br>
 But after doing your chores for the last five days I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that you&#39;re just a lazy, spoiled brat.
 <br>
 Hazel never talked like that.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not fair.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve been doing them for five days.
 <br>
 Try 16 years, man.
 <br>
 - You know, I guess I&#39;m just grateful.
 <br>
 - Stop it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re making me look bad.
 <br>
 Plus you&#39;ve become, like, a total drag to hang out with.
 <br>
 What ever happened to the psychotic troublemaker we all know and love? Look, put down the dishes and start doing something stupid and senseless right now.
 <br>
 Forman, I&#39;m a guest here.
 <br>
 Then fine.
 <br>
 I guess I will have to do something stupid.
 <br>
 I know something stupid we can do.
 <br>
 You got a bowling ball? What? And they&#39;re arguing and arguing and arguing.
 <br>
 Okay, no offense, Donna but all this talk about your mom and dad fighting it&#39;s boring me.
 <br>
 Really? Talking about your hair was fascinating.
 <br>
 Hold it by the thumbhole.
 <br>
 Okay, what are those idiots doing? Something idiotic.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go find out.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be such a baby.
 <br>
 We just want to see how high it&#39;ll bounce.
 <br>
 - Nothing bad can happen.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Forman, man, think.
 <br>
 You are listening to Kelso.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 - Now you&#39;re telling me what to do? - Enough talk.
 <br>
 Do it.
 <br>
 See, I never even thought of that.
 <br>
 Later.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 See you.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Maybe they won&#39;t notice.
 <br>
 Okay, Kitty, it&#39;s your turn.
 <br>
 Pick a key.
 <br>
 My gosh, there are so many, I can&#39;t tell which ones are ours.
 <br>
 Kitty, you don&#39;t pick your key because then you&#39;d go home with your own husband.
 <br>
 And who wants that? I Me? But the whole point of a key party is to meet new and interesting people and have sex with them.
 <br>
 My God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re swingers.
 <br>
 Red, honey, it&#39;s time to leave.
 <br>
 - Now? I&#39;m having a good time.
 <br>
 - I left the iron on.
 <br>
 And the stove.
 <br>
 I left the iron on, on the stove which is also on.
 <br>
 And that It can&#39;t be safe.
 <br>
 - Kitty, what&#39;s wrong with you? - Red, look whose keys I&#39;ve got.
 <br>
 Dear Lord.
 <br>
 You lucky bastard.
 <br>
 Bite her earlobes, she loves that.
 <br>
 What the hell are you talking about? Red, you do know that this is a wife-swapping party, right? What? Are you telling me you want to sleep with my wife? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take a run at any one of these ladies.
 <br>
 What the hell&#39;s wrong with my wife? Nothing, Red, it&#39;s just done random so that it&#39;s fair.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all.
 <br>
 Bull I thought I knew you.
 <br>
 You do.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the same guy who&#39;s got shrapnel in my No.
 <br>
 Good night.
 <br>
 Come on, Bob.
 <br>
 They&#39;re swingers.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 It took a really weird hop.
 <br>
 Why would you drop a bowling ball on the couch? What good could come of it? - Okay.
 <br>
 Hindsight being - Eric.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to hear any more of your dumbass excuses.
 <br>
 This is the most irresponsible, idiotic thing you have ever done.
 <br>
 Actually, Red, I did it.
 <br>
 You? No, Dad, Hyde&#39;s just covering for me.
 <br>
 I did it.
 <br>
 - Forman, stop.
 <br>
 Red, it was me.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 It was me.
 <br>
 Guess what? I don&#39;t care! You&#39;re both idiots.
 <br>
 And if you have to get a job digging ditches you are gonna buy me a new TV.
 <br>
 Now get out of my sight.
 <br>
 - Yes, sir.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Sir.
 <br>
 I could&#39;ve had a Corvette! Oh, Red.
 <br>
 No, Kitty, damn it, I&#39;m pissed.
 <br>
 I mean, Bull&#39;s a freako pervert and he gets everything he wants.
 <br>
 I work hard, I raise a family, and what do I get? A bowling ball in my TV.
 <br>
 You know what I&#39;ve got? Your keys.
 <br>
 I want a big TV.
 <br>
 - A big one.
 <br>
 - This one&#39;s on sale.
 <br>
 That&#39;s last year&#39;s model.
 <br>
 And my TV&#39;s gonna be new.
 <br>
 - What about that one? - No remote.
 <br>
 My TV&#39;s gotta have a remote.
 <br>
 Look at this.
 <br>
 Twenty-six-inch screen.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t even know they made them that big.
 <br>
 Dad, your old TV wasn&#39;t that big.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 But my new TV&#39;s gonna be that big.
 <br>
