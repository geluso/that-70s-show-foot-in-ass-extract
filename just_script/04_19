<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Jackie, you clocked out half an hour ago.
 <br>
 Did you come back to tell me something? Because I feel the same way.
 <br>
 I was waiting outside for Michael to pick me up, but the idiot never showed.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the third time this week.
 <br>
 Three strikes and he&#39;s out, according to the rules of baseball and love.
 <br>
 Actually, it&#39;s four strikes, if you count the time he showed up late &#39;cause he had to see how TheJetsons ended.
 <br>
 Man, first he goes behind your back and takes that modeling job and now this whole Jetsons thing? No futuristic cartoon could ever keep me from you.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to us.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Jackie, you need to cheer up.
 <br>
 And the first step to cheering up is giving Todd a hug.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I am so glad I went shopping today! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! - What do I do? - Run like the wind! Eric! Did you get a haircut? &#39;Cause I love it.
 <br>
 You look just like Parker Stevenson.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause I told the guy that he should- No, no, no! That&#39;s not gonna work, tramp-face.
 <br>
 I saw tongue.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, I know you and I don&#39;t have the best relationship.
 <br>
 - You mean, I hate you, and you hate me.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 So, let&#39;s turn over a new leaf by you never telling Michael what you think you just saw.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Or I could just torture you with this information until I&#39;m bored.
 <br>
 - Eric! - Okay, you know what? I&#39;ll make you a deal.
 <br>
 You can buy two guaranteed hours of silence by carving this wheel of cheddar into a handsome likeness of me.
 <br>
 And go.
 <br>
 - Red, dinner&#39;s ready.
 <br>
 - Five more minutes, Kitty.
 <br>
 A bunch of birds threw a &#39;&#39;crap on my Corvette&#39;&#39; party.
 <br>
 If I don&#39;t get it off, the paint will oxidize.
 <br>
 Oxidize! Why don&#39;t you just put the car in the garage? Because if I put the car in the garage, I can&#39;t see it from the dinner table! Kitty, don&#39;t give advice about things you don&#39;t understand! Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the crazy one.
 <br>
 Well, um, let&#39;s just go ahead and eat.
 <br>
 Oh, we&#39;re not doing that yet? You know, ever since Red got his new car, he can barely tear himself away from it.
 <br>
 You better watch out, Kitty, or you&#39;re gonna end up a Corvette widow.
 <br>
 Oh, no, he loves that car.
 <br>
 He deserves it.
 <br>
 The last treat he bought himself was a pellet gun to shoot the chipmunks that were stealing our tomatoes.
 <br>
 And I had to throw that away, because it was giving him war nightmares.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad you threw it out.
 <br>
 That thing hurt.
 <br>
 Kitty, I know what I&#39;m talking about.
 <br>
 As soon as my ex-husband got a boat, it was like he forgot I even existed.
 <br>
 So I divorced him, took the boat and spent a vigorous three-day weekend on it with the harbormaster.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t think that&#39;s kitchen talk.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 I saw Jackie making out with the guy from the cheese shop! The little dude! No way! Yup.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re the only one I told, so don&#39;t say a word to anyone.
 <br>
 Okay, my little Secret Squirrel? My lips are sealed.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I knew I could count on you.
 <br>
 You always can.
 <br>
 Think about it.
 <br>
 We hold information that could crush the very heart and soul of one of our best friends.
 <br>
 I live for days like this! Oh, but just remember, you&#39;re the only one I told.
 <br>
 ( All ) Your secret&#39;s safe with me.
 <br>
 ( Whistling Through Teeth ) Well, you missed a nice dinner.
 <br>
 Joanne said the funniest thing.
 <br>
 She said I was gonna end up a Corvette widow.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) - ( Laughs ) Isn&#39;t that a kick? Oh, Kitty, I wouldn&#39;t leave you for the car.
 <br>
 Who&#39;d make dinner? Oh, no.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) I think it&#39;s the time to proveJoanne wrong.
 <br>
 How are you gonna proveJoanne wrong? What surprising and thoughtful deed are you gonna do to proveJoanne wrong? I&#39;m gonna prove Joanne wrong by taking you out on a special date soon.
 <br>
 - Tomorrow.
 <br>
 - Good answer! ( Chuckles ) Oh, hey, guys.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Kelso&#39;s loyal girlfriend,Jackie.
 <br>
 ( All ) Hi,Jackie! Okay, I&#39;m not here to stay.
 <br>
 I just came to get Michael.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Oh, no, stay.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just gonna hang out and fool around.
 <br>
 We all know how much you like to fool around.
 <br>
 Okay, Michael, come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go to The Hub.
 <br>
 No, I want to stay here and fool around! So, hey,Jackie, how&#39;s it going down at the cheese shop? You must be so tired from giving it away at the mall.
 <br>
 - What are you laughing at? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 What are you laughing at? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - ( Together) What are you laughing at? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) - ( All ) What are you laughing at? I really don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - Come on, Michael.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go! - No, let&#39;s stay.
 <br>
 We could play Monopoly! Oh, but that wouldn&#39;t be much fun, since we all know thatJackie cheats.
 <br>
 I do not! Oh, you do cheat.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve all caught you.
 <br>
 Red, this is supposed to be our special date.
 <br>
 There is nothing special about an auto show! Oh, no? How &#39;bout it&#39;s special &#39;cause you&#39;re the only woman here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the queen of the auto show! - Lord, grant me the serenity to accept- - Oh, come on, Kitty.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be fun.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always saying how we should share each other&#39;s interests.
 <br>
 I only said that to get you to go to the Figurine Festival.
 <br>
 Okay, I do.
 <br>
 I want us to share our interests, so I&#39;ll start.
 <br>
 Teach me about cars.
 <br>
 I&#39;m excited! That&#39;s my girl.
 <br>
 Holy crap! Look at the paint job on that T-bird.
 <br>
 Wait here.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Wait here? Well, someone&#39;s gotta guard the car.
 <br>
 Who better than the queen? ( Red ) Not on the bumper.
 <br>
 ! Oh,Jackie, great.
 <br>
 Just the person I was looking for.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ve got this itch right above my shoulder.
 <br>
 Be a good girl.
 <br>
 Give- Give a little scratch.
 <br>
 Eric, I came here to talk to you about what happened yesterday.
 <br>
 Okay, but I can&#39;t hear you if you&#39;re not scratchin&#39;.
 <br>
 Yeah! Things between me and Michael have been weird lately and when Todd kissed me, I guess I just gave in &#39;cause I felt vulnerable.
 <br>
 But I made a terrible mistake.
 <br>
 And I was hoping you&#39;d show me some compassion.
 <br>
 Compassion.
 <br>
 Wait, is that the feeling you get when someone just shined your shoes? Because if so, you are in luck.
 <br>
 And go.
 <br>
 You know what? I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 See, I may have kissed Todd but you knew about it all along and didn&#39;t tell Michael.
 <br>
 And that is way worse than what I did.
 <br>
 Wait, what? Yeah.
 <br>
 See, girlfriends are supposed to lie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what we do.
 <br>
 But best friends are supposed to be loyal, and you weren&#39;t.
 <br>
 So guess what? You&#39;re screwed, &#39;cause I&#39;m telling Michael everything! - You wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Oh, I so would! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Well-Well, this certainly blew up in my face! When I tell Michael what you did, he&#39;s gonna forget all about what I did.
 <br>
 Unless I get to him first.
 <br>
 You wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Well, to quote a certain manager-kissing cheese maiden I know &#39;&#39;I so would!&#39;&#39; And go! - ( Grunts ) Not here! - Damn it! Okay, Todd, like, I know we kissed and it was probably, like, the best kiss you&#39;ll ever have.
 <br>
 But it didn&#39;t mean anything, and nothing&#39;s gonna come of it.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re gonna have to get over me.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what? Please don&#39;t fire me, because I really need this job.
 <br>
 Okay? Great.
 <br>
 See you tomorrow! Look, Kelso, I am so sorry! - Get out of my way.
 <br>
 - Wait, Michael! ( Door Slams ) Great.
 <br>
 He hates me, right? No.
 <br>
 He hates me.
 <br>
 We didn&#39;t even talk about you.
 <br>
 I mean, I told him about the kiss, and he just stormed off.
 <br>
 I couldn&#39;t even tell him I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Okay, well- I&#39;m not going to feel sorry for you, so- Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, y-you can&#39;t make me.
 <br>
 I just love him so much.
 <br>
 ( Groaning ) Oh, God.
 <br>
 Okay, look.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 I-It&#39;s just one kiss, right? That&#39;s not so bad.
 <br>
 Just tell Kelso what you told me about, you know, how you felt vulnerable and stuff.
 <br>
 Now he doesn&#39;t even want to see me.
 <br>
 So, you know what? We&#39;ll go hang out in my basement and wait for him to come by.
 <br>
 He left his bouncy ball there, so, you know, he&#39;s bound to be by sometime.
 <br>
 You&#39;d do that for me? As long as you promise not to rat me out.
 <br>
 Deal.
 <br>
 So, friends? ( Giggles ) As long as you promise not to tell people we&#39;re friends.
 <br>
 You guys are never gonna believe this.
 <br>
 Jackie cheated on me.
 <br>
 With the cheese guy! ( Gasps ) No! Yeah.
 <br>
 I was just as shocked as you are.
 <br>
 Well, thank God all she did was kiss him.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 How do you know all she did was kiss him? ( Scoffs ) Kiss? Gee, I- I didn&#39;t say &#39;&#39;kiss.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Don&#39;t make fun of my accent.
 <br>
 That cheese guy&#39;s lucky he&#39;s a little fella, or I&#39;d kick his ass.
 <br>
 Just, boom! Right in the ass! Hey, man, you gotta kick his ass.
 <br>
 Like, on Fantasy Island ifTattoo took one of Mr.
 <br>
 Roarke&#39;s women up to his little tower and put it to her Roarke would slap that little dude like a drunk Southern widow! Then he&#39;d hit him off with some vicious voodoo.
 <br>
 Voodoo on Tattoo.
 <br>
 Voodoo.
 <br>
 Tattoo.
 <br>
 Peekaboo.
 <br>
 Honeydew.
 <br>
 Kung fu.
 <br>
 Koo-koo-ka-choo.
 <br>
 I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 Well, look who&#39;s finally back.
 <br>
 While you were gone, some guy came by to compliment me on my headlights.
 <br>
 Pretty sure he wasn&#39;t talkin&#39; about the car! I got us funnel cakes! It&#39;s like a second honeymoon.
 <br>
 Kitty, not in the car.
 <br>
 Hey, nice Vette.
 <br>
 You should come see the custom job I did on mine.
 <br>
 Cost me three grand and a marriage.
 <br>
 - Three grand? - And a marriage! I&#39;ll only be a minute, Kitty.
 <br>
 What are you lookin&#39; at, gearhead? Your ass is mine, cheese puff!.
 <br>
 How did you know my nickname? Wait, your nickname&#39;s cheese puff? Stay focused.
 <br>
 Kick his ass! Yeah, right.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 What do you think you&#39;re doing kissing my girlfriend huh? Huh? Well, maybe if you paid more attention to that gorgeous creature than your little modeling gig, it wouldn&#39;t have happened.
 <br>
 Little? That picture sold hundreds of young men&#39;s briefs all over the greater Kenosha area! It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 I bought three pairs.
 <br>
 Very supportive.
 <br>
 Yeah, so look.
 <br>
 I know you&#39;re a little fella, but I can&#39;t let you go around kissin&#39; my girlfriend.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re gonna have to take a punch.
 <br>
 I understand.
 <br>
 That didn&#39;t look like it hurt him at all.
 <br>
 Well, I guess it&#39;s my turn.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t mean to scare you, little guy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a black belt.
 <br>
 All right! Didn&#39;t see that coming! Thanks to your funnel-cake accident I&#39;ll have to spend half the night cleaning out the car.
 <br>
 Well, I hope you two will be very happy together.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I have a black eye, and I need ice! I&#39;m not doing anything else for men today.
 <br>
 -Just go away.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna go away.
 <br>
 I&#39;m having a really bad day.
 <br>
 I got decked by a guy who kissed Jackie.
 <br>
 He was huge.
 <br>
 And she thinks that it was okay to kiss him, because I&#39;ve been ignorin&#39; her for work.
 <br>
 Which I barely did! And I got a black eye, and I need someone to care about me! Well, well, well.
 <br>
 Michael ignored Jackie, and she kissed another boy.
 <br>
 That is completely different! He ignored her for a stupid job.
 <br>
 I ignored you for a car! - Crap.
 <br>
 - Oh, burn! How many times you want to get hit today? - Kitty, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - ( Door Opens, Closes ) Next time, I&#39;ll be happy to forget about the car and go to whatever figurine quilting, macramé, man-killing thing you want to do.
 <br>
 Actually, there&#39;s a knitting bee at the community center right now.
 <br>
 You&#39;re kidding.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) And you know what they say about those knitters: They spin quite a yarn! ( Snorts, Laughs ) You know what would really teach me a lesson? Leaving me at home to, you know, think about what I&#39;ve done.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re not in that car in two seconds, I&#39;ll make you carry my knitting basket.
 <br>
 Coming, dear.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 So Kelso got beat up? Yeah, by the little dude at the cheese shop.
 <br>
 It was awesome, man.
 <br>
 Like a hurricane of tiny fists.
 <br>
 All right, look.
 <br>
 Jackie, here&#39;s the deal.
 <br>
 You cheated on me.
 <br>
 - You used to cheat on me all the time! - Yeah? Well, yeah.
 <br>
 But you cheated out of hate, and I cheated out of joy.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t cheat out of hate, Michael.
 <br>
 I cheated because lately, you&#39;ve been acting like I don&#39;t exist.
 <br>
 Well, I sure know you exist now that you Frenched the whole mall! Look, I know that I need to pay more attention to you and I want to forgive you but I have all this anger built up inside of me and nowhere to put it.
 <br>
 Eric knew about the kiss all along and didn&#39;t tell you.
 <br>
 - You knew? -Jackie.
 <br>
 What&#39;d you expect? You&#39;re a dead man, Forman! Get him, Michael! Well, guys, uh, just so you&#39;re up to speed ( Smacks Lips ) I knew about the kiss all along.
 <br>
 Eric told me.
 <br>
 He made me his Secret Squirrel.
 <br>
 What? That dill-hole said I was the only one he told.
 <br>
 - Me too! - Me too! ( Laughing ) It was hilarious.
 <br>
 You guys should&#39;ve seen it.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s foot got stuck in a gopher hole, and- and- Hey, w-w-why are you guys all looking at me like that? I was your Secret Squirrel? You son of a bitch! Get him.
 <br>
 ! ( Red ) The &#39;58&#39;s the only one with the chrome detail.
 <br>
 ( All ) Mmm.
 <br>
 Men and cars.
 <br>
 Never got it, never will.
 <br>
