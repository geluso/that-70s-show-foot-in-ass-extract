 Oh my God! Did you hear that? It sounds like a bloody hook scraping against the backdoor.
 <br>
 Whats wrong, youre like a millions miles away? I dont know.
 <br>
 Its just like my parents are fighting like all the time.
 <br>
 It just makes me so mad.
 <br>
 Like I wanna kick their asses but I cant.
 <br>
 I wanna do something! Okay Take me Donna! What?! Go ahead, take me! Punish your parents by using me for sex! Do your business and be done with it! Go ahead! Dont be shy! I can take it! ButGoddo be gentle! You didnt actually think that was gonna work did you? No, but Im a virgin and its driving me crazy.
 <br>
 But thats not your fault.
 <br>
 No wait, YES it is! How do you do that? Do what? You always make me feel better.
 <br>
 Uhm, well thank you.
 <br>
 I love you Eric.
 <br>
 I lovecake! Morning Bob! Mornin Red! Probably wondering why Im in your car eh? No.
 <br>
 Just get out and have a nice day.
 <br>
 Midgy and I got into a fight Red, and I walked out! Guess thatll teach her right? Well, youre the one sleeping in the car, Bob.
 <br>
 Right, well, thats cause when I stormed out, I sort of forgot some stuff.
 <br>
 You know, keys, wallet, blowdryer.
 <br>
 All I need now is a place to stay maybe with some friends? Well uhhhwe dont uhh have a blowdryer Bob.
 <br>
 Lauries got a blowdryer, I know! Cause shes had that Farrah Fawcett hairdo.
 <br>
 Thats not natural! You know, I wouldnt even need my own room, just a little corner to sleep in! Bob I really I mean, would youahh cripes.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Ah thanks Red! Your my best friend.
 <br>
 No, Im not! Do you think when girls have sleepovers, sometimes they play games and giggle and then every once in a while they start out to make out altogether in a big naked heap? - I sure hope so! - Me too! Ahummm.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 may I have your attention please?! I would like to introduce to you all the new Michael Kelso ! Sooo, what do you think?! Yeah, Jackie says it makes me look like Marlon Brando in the Wild Ones.
 <br>
 Yeah, Im so Brando! Yeah, if Brando had a buddy named Potsie! What are you even saying? I think you know what Im saying.
 <br>
 EYYYY! Jackie, did you dress me up like the Fonz? No Michael, I did not dress you up like the Fonz! Although I mean I like the Fonz you know hes kinda Fez?! Fonz, yes or no? Well you know me Kelso, I just want you to be happy.
 <br>
 Thank you Fez! Now, if I could just have a moment of your time? Sure! Good, yes.
 <br>
 Okay a gang of tugs has taken over our town! Help us Fonzie, you are our only hope! I cant believe you guys! Here I am, as Brando as can be, and you guys cant even see that! Well you can both just Sit on it?! Why is Bob in my bathtub? You told me you sent him home, thats what you said, he went home! He did go home.
 <br>
 And then Midge kicked him out.
 <br>
 But he went home! Well, now hes back! Red, he is IN my bathtub! I cant have him in my bathtub! His afro-gel is gonna leave a ring! This isnt easy on me either Kitty! He tried to talk to me about his feelings! He almost started to cry! I really wanted to punch him! Bob cant stay here Red.
 <br>
 I know that makes me a bad person, I dont care.
 <br>
 Im bad so just lets get him out of here! Well then, go talk to Midge and fix it up.
 <br>
 Ahahahahhh! NO! You let the stray in, you find him a home! Its not that simple Kitty.
 <br>
 Do you want me to go to my unhappy place Red? Ill talk to Midge first thing in the morning Thank you Red, you wonderful husband.
 <br>
 Now, when youre done with the paper you get upstairs and scrub my tub! Okay, youre done! I wont do it! Well I wont either.
 <br>
 Well I dont know what the hell were gonna do! Kelso, it was brave of you to come back.
 <br>
 We gave you quite a ribbing.
 <br>
 Yeah, except for this time, I brought a hot fresh pizza! But its only for my friends who dont make fun of me! Mmmm pizza! Kelso man, I got a thousand insults and no pizza is gonna make me .
 <br>
 Is that sausage? Brilliant bastard! Guys, let me ask you something, Donna told me she loves me, and then I told her I love cake Thats not bad is it? Im still cool right? Okay, I dont know what happened, I just panicked and it popped out, I mean, I dont remember ever wanting to talk about cake.
 <br>
 I wasnt really that hungry.
 <br>
 Cake is good.
 <br>
 But you cannot have sex with cake! Ofcourse you cannot have sex with Donna either, so Yeah man, you shouldve just lied and told her that you loved her, I love you baby, see and I dont love you isnt that great? He DOES love her you dope.
 <br>
 Right? Okay, well, if I admit it, are you guys gonna make fun of me? Oh Eric, love is not a joke.
 <br>
 This is a joke: knock knock Whos there? Look if you really do love her, there is only one thing to do man! Youve got to dump her and live free! Dont listen to him man, hes stupid.
 <br>
 Heres what you gotta do: she said it, now youve got to say it! Then shell say it back and everything will be okay.
 <br>
 Oh and get her pizza, cause right now I kinda love Kelso! Yeah I can do that.
 <br>
 Ill just say it and then Ill be back on top again.
 <br>
 Allright! So now where was I when Fonzie here moved to town? Hey! Give that backtomundo! Eric! Eric, are you okay? What, yeah You look like youve got a stomach-ache or something.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 There is nothing wrong with my stomach.
 <br>
 Its just that Ilove you Man! Haha! And then he punched me in the arm and said: &#34;Man!&#34; Oh my God.
 <br>
 What a horrible disaster! Well go on! I guess I like totally screwed things up.
 <br>
 Cause ever since I said I love you hes been acting SO weird.
 <br>
 Okay wait a second, Im a little confused, why did YOU say I love you? Because Ilove him! Uh Donna! Thats got nothing to do with it! YOU are way too young to be saying I love you.
 <br>
 Shut up Jackie, you say it to Kelso all the time and you are like younger than me.
 <br>
 Not in love-years.
 <br>
 Alright look.
 <br>
 Eric doesnt know how to handle that kind of thing.
 <br>
 You probably just scared him off.
 <br>
 All you could do right now is play it cool for a while, turn down the emotional heat and Donna, God willing, hell forget you threw yourself at him.
 <br>
 I know it sounds impossible, but what you just said actually makes sense.
 <br>
 Look the sooner you realise Im a genius, the better off well both be! Oh, hi Red! Sorry I cant open the door, but I dont want Bob sneaking back into the house again.
 <br>
 Thats okay, I just came by to see how youre doing.
 <br>
 Oh Im working through some things.
 <br>
 Gotten past denial and Im well on my way to acceptance Yeah well couldnt agree with you more, well anyway Take Bob back! Red I cant do that right now.
 <br>
 Midge, Ive talked to Bob, and hes really sorry.
 <br>
 Now be a sport and take him back! I cant.
 <br>
 - TAKE HIM BACK MIDGE! - NO! TAKE HIM! NO! THIS ISNT OVER PINCIOTTI! Donna, check it out.
 <br>
 Hey Kelso! Popsicle! Where did it go? Perhaps it went under the couch? Jackie, lets get out of here, this is kinda lame Yeah sure.
 <br>
 Wait Donna! So Ill see you later? NO! Youre never gonna see me again! Ha! Shes a little pistol huh What did you do?! Nothing! I did what you said! I told her I loved her! Youre LYING! No its true! Exceptexcept, I might have.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you know popped her one on the shoulder and called her man.
 <br>
 You idiot! Wait! This isnt my fault! Its YOUR fault! You said if I told her I loved her shed say it back, but she didnt man! She just stared at me! Well did you give her a chance to answer?! How long did you wait before you completely muffed out? Forever man! Likefive minutes! Youre LYING! No its true, it was like well maybe just a couple of seconds, but I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Time ceased to exist okay! I was just hangin out there, really far out there, justhangin ! Eric contributes in class but does not follow directions! MAN, where the heck is that fudgesicle?! Hey, is that my fudgesicle? No, this ones mine.
 <br>
 Damn, where is my fudgesicle?! Just tell me how am I supposed to fix this?! Well, first of all, you need to learn how to handle a little woman troubles without getting all freaked out.
 <br>
 Its pretty unmanly man.
 <br>
 Laurie! Hahahahahahaha! EYYYYYYY! Thats IT, I hate this stupid thing! Laurie laughing at me But Kelso, I thought we were supposed to handle our woman troubles like a man? You shut up! You just SHUT UP! And if anybody else here laughs at me, I swear, Im gonna kick SO MUCH ass! And thats MY fudgesicle! Im telling you man, that jacket is the best thing that ever happened to us! I cant do it now Kitty, hes sleeping! BOOOOOBB! Oh, Bob, youre awake! Hi! Lets see it was ehm it was no go with Midge.
 <br>
 She doesnt wanna see you.
 <br>
 Boy thats a shame Red.
 <br>
 Guess its you and me buddy.
 <br>
 Well thats a problem.
 <br>
 I like you Bob, you dont borrow my things, you keep your lawn mowed, but the fact of the matter is, youre a little bit youre kind of a Youre an ass.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well its not your fault.
 <br>
 Weve gotta stop pussyfootin around here and somehow get you back in that house! How?! Oh, its you.
 <br>
 Im NOT taking him back Red! No no no no, Im just gonna trim a few of these branches for you.
 <br>
 Oh okay.
 <br>
 HELP! Midge! Im trapped under this very heavy branch! HELP! OH MY GOD! RED! Are you hurt?! GO BOB! GOOOO! Im IN!! NOOO! Red, that was NOT nice! Im not sorry Midge! Great shot! And I love you.
 <br>
 Well the basket doesnt really count because I travelled.
 <br>
 You could never travel.
 <br>
 Because I love you.
 <br>
 Eric, youre acting like a huge dork.
 <br>
 A huge dork who loves you.
 <br>
 God stop it! Alright, look the only reason I said it is because I felt it.
 <br>
 And not just so youd say it back.
 <br>
 And if I knew you would get in such a twist about it, I wouldnt have said it at all! Im NOT in a twist! Its just cake okay that was pretty stupid.
 <br>
 Yes! Thank you! So, I mean, why did you say it? I dont know, I just now, once IT is out there, if we broke up, I mean, what would I tell myself then? I guess you could tell yourself you still have cake, we both know how much it means to you! Thats nice, there is a sweet girl Okay, look, I have an idea.
 <br>
 Why dont we pretend it just never happened? - I like that - Now.
 <br>
 - never happened! - Okay.
 <br>
 Thenyou DID travel soMy ball! Hi you two! Thought you might wanna know, Midge and I worked things out.
 <br>
 Well thats just great Bob! Yeah, were separating.
 <br>
 You cant stay with us! No, Ill be staying at home, were gonna live together, were just gonna see other people.
 <br>
 Okay Bob, how much did you think about this? Youre living in the same house, but youre dating other people.
 <br>
 Im not saying for sure therell be problems, but I want you to think about it.
 <br>
 Think hard Bob! I think its gonna be sexy! Oh Hyde! What a fabulous look for you! Seriously, you look like Marlon Brando or something! O my God! Hyde, when did you get so hot?! What?! Ive always been hot.

 Wow.
 <br>
 Are you okay? Yeah, but I mean thats just the dumbest thing Ive ever heard! I mean, how is that supposed to work?
