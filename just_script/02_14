<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So! Lets get to the lovin, huh? So, how bout a little mood music, huh? Zepplin or Foghat? Whatever.
 <br>
 Laurie, are you ok? Im sorry, I guess Im just not into it today.
 <br>
 Actually, I feel like talking.
 <br>
 Oh! Yeah, ok, yeah, Ill try anything once.
 <br>
 Well, its justlately, I feel like all my friends are away at school and Im the only one here, and I just feel like this huge failure! Laurie! Dont be silly.
 <br>
 Failures are ugly and youre hot! Thats true! Yeah! Thanks, Kelso! Yeah.
 <br>
 I guess it all started in Jr.
 <br>
 High.
 <br>
 Thats when a girl really defines who she is.
 <br>
 You know what I mean? Sowere talking some more? I really wanna talk.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Guess Ill put my shirt back on so we can talk some more.
 <br>
 Great! Yeah, super.
 <br>
 Look at this ad, Red.
 <br>
 Theyre opening a Price Mart right in our own town.
 <br>
 Fourteen ninety-five for a toaster.
 <br>
 Can ya believe it? No, I cant.
 <br>
 I bought that very same toaster in your store for twice that.
 <br>
 Yeah, thats my point.
 <br>
 That you screwed me? Red, fourteen ninety-five is below my cost.
 <br>
 This Price Mart could put me out of business.
 <br>
 Hey, theyre hiring! Red, you cant.
 <br>
 These giant corporations come into town, they destroy little businesses like mine.
 <br>
 Theyre evil.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess thats true Where is the food? Eric, you should give your refrigerator to people who have food.
 <br>
 Look at this.
 <br>
 Hamburger Helper.
 <br>
 Tuna Helper.
 <br>
 A can of beets? Oh, gross, I will not eat a darn beet.
 <br>
 You know what, Forman, your dad better get a job, and soon.
 <br>
 Because Im starving here.
 <br>
 Ill tell him you said that.
 <br>
 Michael, its not polite to remind poor people that theyre po- less fortunate.
 <br>
 Were not less fortunate.
 <br>
 Were just on a budget.
 <br>
 Well, it is a hell of a tiny budget! Oh, thats not funny, thats sad.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, eat that.
 <br>
 All right, green Jell-O.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie, try some.
 <br>
 I heard green stuff makes you horny.
 <br>
 Michael, that only works with green M + Ms, duh! Nuh-uh! Its everything green! Right, Donna? Actually, Kelso.
 <br>
 You know what really makes you horny? Beets.
 <br>
 Yeah, right.
 <br>
 Nah, its true, I saw it on Sixty Minutes, man.
 <br>
 Beet farmers with like, ten, fifteen kids.
 <br>
 Man, hows come everything thats good for you always tastes so bad? Im trying it! Michael, honey, dont eat our beets! You know, Michael, Mrs.
 <br>
 Formans right.
 <br>
 Youre horny enough as it is.
 <br>
 Sometimes, I wish you had two girlfriends.
 <br>
 Oh my god, are you serious? - What? - Nothing! I get it, Bob! Kitty, Im getting a job at Price Mart! And I guess, Ive just been too concerned with the needs of others and I havent thought enough about myself.
 <br>
 Kelso? Yeah, yeah! Listening.
 <br>
 So, what do you think? Well, uhI agree? Really? Yeah! I mean, everything you said makes so much sense! So, who wants sex, I know I do! Kelso, Im feeling really close to you.
 <br>
 Um I think I want a relationship! Yes.
 <br>
 Thats what I want! A sexual relationship.
 <br>
 NO, no, I mean, I want more from you than just sex.
 <br>
 Dont be silly, Laurie, sex is enough for any woman.
 <br>
 Kelso, I want an emotional relationship.
 <br>
 Exactly! We both want a sexually emotional relationship! This Price Mart looks like a heck of an outfit, Kitty! Yeah, maybe I should go down there and get a job, too.
 <br>
 Eric, when your fathers in a good mood, what do I say? - No talking? - Thank you! Eric, Ive told you.
 <br>
 Your job is to study hard, get good grades, get a scholarship, go to college and move away! End of discussion! Thenhow come Hyde gets to have a job? Because, Forman.
 <br>
 You have potential.
 <br>
 - Whereas Ill be a success if I stay out of jail.
 <br>
 - Exactly! Oh, no, Steven, that is not true! Its just, its a little different because he doesnt have any parents! Oh my god, I dont have any parents? Ok, ok! Wish me luck.
 <br>
 - Ok, good luck, honey! Knock em dead! - Good Luck Man, whats his problem? I justI just wanna help out.
 <br>
 Well, I am sorry, Eric, but I agree with your father.
 <br>
 School is your job.
 <br>
 Oh, andalso to be my precious little baby boy! Mom! We talked about this.
 <br>
 Im not a boy any more.
 <br>
 Im a man.
 <br>
 Shut up, Hyde! I am a man! Fine.
 <br>
 My precious little baby man! Oh, man.
 <br>
 You are so lucky your moms a run away alcoholic.
 <br>
 Ted: I must say, Red, I am very impressed with your experience.
 <br>
 Well, thank you, Mr.
 <br>
 Herbeson! Ted: Oh, call me Ted, Red.
 <br>
 Hey, Ted, Red, thats funny.
 <br>
 Yeah, it is, uh, I didnt catch it there at first, but then, woop! Thats funny! Ted: I see youre applying for our supervisor position, what would you say if I offered you a job right now? Id say lets break out the champale! Ted: Great, cause were hiring cashiers.
 <br>
 You get your own smock.
 <br>
 But Im not a cashier, Ted.
 <br>
 Im management.
 <br>
 Ted: Ok! Then well let you know.
 <br>
 So, uhRed, Ted, thats pretty funny though! Ted: On second thought, its not that funny.
 <br>
 - Red, come and eat your dinner! - Shh! Not hungry.
 <br>
 Hey, whats going on? Shh! Reds waiting for a phone call.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Shh! Sorry! You know, that phone hasnt rung all damn day! Maybe its broken.
 <br>
 No, its not broken! No, its not broken.
 <br>
 Oh! Damn! They could have called right then, got a busy signal, moved on to the next guy on the list, oh, man! I just screwed myself out of a job! Wait, Red, wait! Let it ring.
 <br>
 You dont wanna seem desperate.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Eric, if this is one of your dumbass friends, you better start running! Please dont be Kelso, please dont be Kelso.
 <br>
 Hello? Its Price Mart! Yes! This is the Forman residence! You have good news! Yeah-huh!Uh-huh! Ok, then.
 <br>
 Thanks for calling.
 <br>
 So whats the good news? Well.
 <br>
 The good news is Eric got a job at Price Mart.
 <br>
 Run, honey, run! Man, Red went ballistic on me! I mean, I wanna keep the job, but I really dont wanna wear my ass for a hat.
 <br>
 Causeyou know, he said he could do that and I believe him.
 <br>
 Come on, Forman.
 <br>
 Fight the power, man! That way I can have your room after Red kills you.
 <br>
 Although Im not sure an ass hat is fatal.
 <br>
 You know what would be a good job for me? Gigolo.
 <br>
 The loving is over.
 <br>
 Now, pay me! So, Lauries been talking a lot lately, right? Shes saying she wants a relationship.
 <br>
 You know, and I kept waiting for the dirty part But the dirty part never came.
 <br>
 Kelso, I have a real problem here, ok? Id like to talk about that.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 You know, dating two girls wasnt supposed to be like this! It was supposed to be like So, do you wanna talk? No way! I just wanna fool around! Yes! Talking is stupid! You know, Ill just wait quietly til you and Laurie are done.
 <br>
 Have fun! Well, thanks, babe.
 <br>
 You know, feel free to jump in.
 <br>
 Kelso, you mind if I join in your sexy circle too? Why not? All Eric ever wants to do is talk.
 <br>
 I told you he was a loser.
 <br>
 I know! I mean, how am I supposed to talk when I dont have a thought in my pretty little red head? See, Michael? Donnas just as empty headed as we are! Oh, Donna, you make a great addition to our sexy circle.
 <br>
 All right, ladies, theres just one rule here.
 <br>
 There are no bras allowed.
 <br>
 The girls: YAY! See, thats pretty sweet, huh? What do you think? I think it makes your ass look big.
 <br>
 You know, I just dont know why my dad doesnt want me to work.
 <br>
 I mean, yeah, Im a real bad boy, Donna.
 <br>
 My big teenage rebellion is toget a job.
 <br>
 Oooh, you never know what Im gonna do next.
 <br>
 Oh my god, look out! Hes got insurance! You know, I think itll be great when you get a job.
 <br>
 Maybe on our dates we wont just have to sit in the car, maybe we can actually drive some where and maybe, I dont know, eat? Or maybe I can get my own popcorn at the movies! Youre a dreamer.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know what? Im gonna keep the job.
 <br>
 Well, youre like a rebel without a cause.
 <br>
 But with a cause.
 <br>
 - And a smock.
 <br>
 - Right! You gotta hide me! Kelso! Are you down there? Crap! Im not here! Have you seen Kelso? - Why, yes I have! Hes hiding from you in the shower! - Ah! Hi! Guess what? I just found my eighth grade diary! Come on, Ill read it to you! Great! Hey, Forman! Good news, Red.
 <br>
 I just took Cosmos ten ways to please your man in bed test, and I got nine out of ten! But I didnt get number three because Im a nurse and number three is icky.
 <br>
 I cant believe that Eric.
 <br>
 Oh, I think working is important to Erics self-esteem, and I really dont think its a big deal.
 <br>
 But he only got a job, Kitty, because I dont have one! And no son of mine is gonna work and screw up his chances to go to college because I cant carry the load.
 <br>
 I should have taken that crummy cashiers job.
 <br>
 Oh, now, what kind of talk is that? You deserve to be supervisor.
 <br>
 In fact, the Red Forman I know would march right down there and fight for it.
 <br>
 Ive been out of work for six months, I cant afford to fight right now, Kitty! I gotta take their crappy offer, and smile like a jackass while I do it.
 <br>
 Red, I dont think your smile is gonna- Oh, Im going for a walk.
 <br>
 Well, wait a minute, honey! You know what, we can split a bottle of wine and Ill, Ill give number three a shot! That was a close one! Did you quit that job? Dad, I wanna keep that job.
 <br>
 Well, its a tough world, Eric, and people dont always get what they want.
 <br>
 Especially you.
 <br>
 Dad, Im pretty sure Im not backing down on this one.
 <br>
 Youre not? Oh, no.
 <br>
 Well, I guess you win, then.
 <br>
 Dad, you always tell me never to back down.
 <br>
 Dont back down.
 <br>
 Formans never back down.
 <br>
 And now youre telling me to back down? Well, Dad, I can only conclude that youre insane! You think thats funny? Well, you know, maybe not in the traditional ha ha sense, but Look, I gotta go.
 <br>
 You know, youre gonna look real funny when youre wearing- Your ass for a hat.
 <br>
 Even though I doubt thats physically possible.
 <br>
 Lets find out together.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Laurie.
 <br>
 I want you to know that I really, really, really enjoy fooling around with you.
 <br>
 Yeah, I get that a lot.
 <br>
 And you should! Cause youre talented! See, but I dont want one of those relationships because I already have one of those with Jackie.
 <br>
 Yeah, but that cant last! No.
 <br>
 See, what Im saying is, is that we have to break this thing off.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Thats a pretty big decision to make all on your own.
 <br>
 Maybe you and me and Jackie should all get together and discuss it! No.
 <br>
 You wouldnt.
 <br>
 Really? Look at me, Kelso.
 <br>
 Look into my  eyes.
 <br>
 Laurie? Will you go out with me? Oh, Kelso, I thought youd never ask! Ted: A smart move taking cashier.
 <br>
 Know you were gunning for supervisor, but, hey.
 <br>
 Theres no shame in backing down.
 <br>
 Well, that is a mighty nice smock.
 <br>
 You know, you think that your kids dont listen to you.
 <br>
 But they do.
 <br>
 Ted: Not sure I follow.
 <br>
 I changed my mind, Ted.
 <br>
 Im here for the supervisors job.
 <br>
 Know what I mean? Ted? Ok, well, now.
 <br>
 Your father should be back from his interview any minute now.
 <br>
 Mom, how come we have to be here? I could be using this time to not be here.
 <br>
 No, this is a very difficult day for your father and he needs to be with his family.
 <br>
 - Ill be in the basement.
 <br>
 - No, you sit! Oh, sure, when things get ugly, suddenly Im family! Not to me, freak.
 <br>
 You are so going to end up in porno! Hi honey! Right to the bar.
 <br>
 Not a good sign.
 <br>
 What are you all looking at? Dont you think that Price Marts new supervisor deserves a drink? Yay! Yeah, I got it! Hey, congratulations, Dad.
 <br>
 Thanks, Eric.
 <br>
 Oh! And youre fired.
 <br>
 What, you cant do that! Yes I can! Youre fired! Hey, you know what? Im not fired.
 <br>
 Ok, if its so important to you, youre not fired.
 <br>
 But if your grades start to slip, you are fired! I love saying that! God help the poor bastards who work for you, huh? Wait, uh, I work for you.
 <br>
 I know! So Dad! You and me going to work together.
 <br>
 What a nightmare, huh? Oh, would you look at that.
 <br>
 They spelled your name wrong! Just doesnt get old, does it? Well, if it isnt Benedict and Arnold.
 <br>
 Bob, I needed that job.
 <br>
 And if you cant get that, well Im sorry, youre a dumbass.
 <br>
 - Look, they misspelled Price Mart! - You wanna keep that finger? Uh-huh.
 <br>
 You gotta stop goofing around, Kelso.
 <br>
 Am I right, Jackie? Laurie is so right, Michael.
 <br>
 We are very disappointed in you.
 <br>
 Even Eric got a job.
 <br>
 Yeah, even my stupid brother got a job.
 <br>
 Yeah, her brothers stupid and he got a job.
 <br>
 - Sexy circle? - Ow!
 <br>
