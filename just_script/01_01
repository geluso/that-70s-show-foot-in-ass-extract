 Eric.
 <br>
 It is time.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you do it? - It&#39;s your house.
 <br>
 - Your house.
 <br>
 Listen to them up there.
 <br>
 The party has reached critical mass.
 <br>
 In 10 minutes, there will be no more beer opportunities.
 <br>
 If my dad catches me copping beers, he&#39;ll kill me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m willing to take that risk.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry about it.
 <br>
 Just remain calm, keep moving.
 <br>
 And above all, don&#39;t get sucked into my dad&#39;s hair.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s wrong with your dad&#39;s hair? - Just don&#39;t look at it.
 <br>
 And, Eric, cold.
 <br>
 Definitely cold.
 <br>
 Young and beautiful Someday your looks will be gone Watch it, Eric! Hot pizza rolls.
 <br>
 Coming through.
 <br>
 Hot, hot.
 <br>
 Kitty, where are you? Okay, take two.
 <br>
 There&#39;s plenty.
 <br>
 There&#39;s plenty coming.
 <br>
 Is everybody good? I know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Vienna sausages are so versatile.
 <br>
 Hi, there, Eric.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 So, Eric, how do you like Bob&#39;s new hair? Isn&#39;t it groovy? It&#39;s incredibly groovy, Mrs.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 - Yeah, it was Midge&#39;s idea.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s a perm.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Hi, Dad.
 <br>
 What the hell happened to Bob&#39;s hair? Beats me.
 <br>
 His head looks like a poodle&#39;s ass.
 <br>
 Boy, just when you think you&#39;ve seen everything.
 <br>
 - A poodle&#39;s ass walks into your party.
 <br>
 - Eric, don&#39;t use the &#34;ass&#34; word.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still in high school.
 <br>
 Yes, sir.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Pigs in a blanket.
 <br>
 Hot.
 <br>
 Hot.
 <br>
 Kitty, is that your Toyota in the drive? Red, a Toyota? Yeah, it&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 I tell you, the last time I was that close to a Japanese machine it was shooting at me.
 <br>
 Honey, it is the gas crisis.
 <br>
 What can you do? And you know, Bob, those SOBs at the dealership offered me a lousy $400 trade-in on the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 Yeah, what you gonna do? It&#39;ll rust in the driveway before I trade it in.
 <br>
 Honey, it is rusting in the driveway.
 <br>
 Pop, I&#39;ll take the cruiser off your hands.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a pump-sucker.
 <br>
 - What you got there, Eric? - Beer.
 <br>
 I found it.
 <br>
 Just sitting you know around.
 <br>
 Put them away, son.
 <br>
 I intend to, sir.
 <br>
 Honey.
 <br>
 On your way to the basement, could you pop these in the fridge? They&#39;re warm.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 I see that every day.
 <br>
 He&#39;s alive! Good news.
 <br>
 My dad is thinking of giving me the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 You&#39;re getting a car? Have I told you how incredibly attractive you are, Eric? No.
 <br>
 You told me he was cute.
 <br>
 No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 I remember, &#39;cause you said not to say anything in front of Eric.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s focus on what&#39;s important here, people.
 <br>
 Forman stole something.
 <br>
 To Forman.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s sad? This is the proudest day of my life.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Marcia, a football in the face.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s gotta hurt.
 <br>
 - Ouch, my nose! - That&#39;s gonna be huge in the morning.
 <br>
 - Huger than my boobs? Bigger than the left one.
 <br>
 Why are we watching this without the sound? I am totally confused.
 <br>
 Here, use the earphone.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s the deal with the Vista Cruiser? The deal is, there is no deal yet.
 <br>
 - How we gonna get to the concert? - Shut up! What concert? Todd Rundgren.
 <br>
 When? - This weekend.
 <br>
 - Who&#39;s going? Eric, and Donna, and me, and Hyde, and the foreign kid Fez.
 <br>
 Pretty much everybody.
 <br>
 - And you.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Thank you for telling me, Michael.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m getting a soda.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Yep, me, too.
 <br>
 Sit down! You don&#39;t want me to go to the concert.
 <br>
 Is that it? I didn&#39;t know if you liked music.
 <br>
 Michael.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t invite you to the concert because I know you really don&#39;t like my friends.
 <br>
 - Did you tell them that? - No.
 <br>
 Michael.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t tell our private conversations to other people.
 <br>
 We have to have our own private conversations.
 <br>
 Also, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be interested in Todd Rundgren.
 <br>
 I mean, like you said, he&#39;s no Frampton.
 <br>
 I love Todd Runddamen.
 <br>
 I have the 45 of Hello, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Remember the night we listened to it? We can have fun at the concert, too.
 <br>
 Especially in the car on the way back.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 You can go.
 <br>
 - Only if you want me to.
 <br>
 I want you to.
 <br>
 Jackie, I guess you&#39;re going to the concert with us.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait.
 <br>
 So, Michael, you wanna go back to my house and listen to Todd Grunion records? Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 Okay, bye.
 <br>
 You kids have fun.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 - Bye, bye, now.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 They&#39;re so darn cute.
 <br>
 Minute you turn your back, they go at it like dogs.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re frisky.
 <br>
 - You can&#39;t leave them alone.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You know my sister thinks that we shouldn&#39;t be left alone.
 <br>
 Us? Yeah.
 <br>
 We&#39;re alone now.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Eric, relax.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve lived next door to each other forever.
 <br>
 You could&#39;ve had me when I was four.
 <br>
 Really? And there I was all day long on the hippity hop.
 <br>
 Stupid.
 <br>
 Stupid.
 <br>
 Stupid.
 <br>
 Ever since yesterday, I can&#39;t stop thinking about you.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;ve known you practically my whole life.
 <br>
 I want you.
 <br>
 I want you so bad.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s a car.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just leave these two kids alone.
 <br>
 Say, hey there, Donna.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 You kids.
 <br>
 Standing around the driveway.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so darn cute.
 <br>
 You know, you may not realize it but this is the most fun you&#39;re ever gonna have.
 <br>
 - So it&#39;s all downhill from here, sir? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - What happened to your dad&#39;s hair? - He got a permanent.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s permanent? Baby! I may not say this right because I am new to English.
 <br>
 But she has tremendous breasts, yes? Michael, who is this guy? That&#39;s Fez.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a foreign exchange student.
 <br>
 Who did we exchange for him? Donna, I have to go to the ladies&#39; room.
 <br>
 Donna? I, too, must go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 Eric? No, it doesn&#39;t work that way with guys.
 <br>
 Kelso, how much longer are we gonna have to deal with the whole Jackie experience? Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m breaking up with her.
 <br>
 - Never gonna happen.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s over.
 <br>
 She&#39;s cutting into my free time.
 <br>
 I I&#39;m hooked on a feeling I&#39;m high on believing So is Red still thinking about giving you the car maybe? Even if we do get it, we&#39;re gonna need some serious gas money &#39;cause the cruiser&#39;s a boat.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s a boat.
 <br>
 This whole gas shortage bites.
 <br>
 Who is getting a boat? There is no gas shortage, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all fake.
 <br>
 The oil companies control everything.
 <br>
 Like, there&#39;s this guy who invented this car that runs on water, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got a fiberglass air-cooled engine, and it runs on water.
 <br>
 So it is a boat.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s a car.
 <br>
 Only, you put water in the gas tank instead of gas.
 <br>
 And it runs on water, man.
 <br>
 I never heard of this car.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s good for gas money.
 <br>
 You are such a whore.
 <br>
 When does the boat get here, whore? Eric! Yeah, dad.
 <br>
 I need to talk to you.
 <br>
 Eric your mother and I have been talking.
 <br>
 Since I&#39;ve been cut back to part-time at the plant and the hospital is so close I can take the Toyota to work, and your mom can take the bus.
 <br>
 Honey.
 <br>
 Honey, really, I&#39;d rather walk.
 <br>
 When I ride the bus in my nurse&#39;s uniform, people always show me their scars.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll drop you off on my way to the plant.
 <br>
 - No, I don&#39;t wanna be any trouble.
 <br>
 - Then Eric can take you.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a teenager.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t wanna drop If he can&#39;t drop his own mother off at work, then I&#39;ll be damned if he&#39;s getting a car! Okay.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 - Am I getting the car? - We didn&#39;t say that.
 <br>
 Things don&#39;t just drop into your lap, Eric.
 <br>
 Not in this life.
 <br>
 A car is a responsibility.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll need insurance.
 <br>
 Do you have any idea how much insurance is? A car is a privilege.
 <br>
 Oil changes, road flares, fluids, that&#39;s your job.
 <br>
 A car is not a bedroom on wheels.
 <br>
 Always yield.
 <br>
 Always! Laurie&#39;s friend got pregnant in a car.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t let that happen.
 <br>
 If I find one beer can in that car, it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 And no doughnuts, either.
 <br>
 Ants.
 <br>
 So do I get the car? - Bitching! - Eric, not in front of your mother.
 <br>
 Thank you, Pop.
 <br>
 Sir.
 <br>
 Yeah clean the attic.
 <br>
 - Kelso, that&#39;s sweet.
 <br>
 - Actually, I&#39;m riding shotgun.
 <br>
 - No, you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not riding in the back.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t we let Eric decide? - Eric? - Kelso.
 <br>
 Get in the back.
 <br>
 - Taking her for a spin? - Yes, sir.
 <br>
 Have a good time.
 <br>
 One more thing.
 <br>
 Very important.
 <br>
 About the car.
 <br>
 She&#39;s old, so no trips out of town.
 <br>
 Ever.
 <br>
 Understood? Have fun.
 <br>
 I guess that&#39;s that.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not going.
 <br>
 - Eric, do you wanna go? - He said no trips out of town.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s your car.
 <br>
 Do you wanna go? - But he&#39;s God.
 <br>
 I think God would want us to go to Milwaukee.
 <br>
 Eric, you are a 17-year-old man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go with whatever you say.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your decision.
 <br>
 It is my decision.
 <br>
 And my decision is: - We&#39;re going to a concert.
 <br>
 - Yeah! The kids are off.
 <br>
 I wonder where they&#39;re going.
 <br>
 Out of town.
 <br>
 Are you sure? Of course.
 <br>
 I told them not to.
 <br>
 So I guess they&#39;ll be gone for a while.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, we&#39;re out of gas.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re not out of gas.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s the battery.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s six years old and shot to hell.
 <br>
 - I know what.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just call my dad.
 <br>
 Kelso, tell her.
 <br>
 - He can&#39;t take the car out of town.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not calling his dad.
 <br>
 Jackie, parents talk to each other about how we screw up.
 <br>
 - Why would they talk about that? - They can&#39;t help it.
 <br>
 Look, say there&#39;s a party, see.
 <br>
 And all of our parents are there.
 <br>
 Together.
 <br>
 Hi, Red.
 <br>
 Say, isn&#39;t it great all our kids are such good friends? Yes, Jackie&#39;s dad, they&#39;re quite the gang of young people.
 <br>
 Kitty, I love what you&#39;ve done with the kitchen.
 <br>
 Yes, aqua and yellow blah, blah, blah, yak, yak, yak.
 <br>
 Speaking of kids wasn&#39;t it lucky Triple-A pulled Eric&#39;s butt out of the fire when he took the car to Milwaukee without your permission? What? Why, that twisted little monkey! I&#39;m grounding him for 10 years.
 <br>
 Kids.
 <br>
 What are you gonna do? I say we torture them with plenty of pointless rules and advice.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody! Let&#39;s hustle! Guys.
 <br>
 We are in the middle of nowhere and I have to go to the ladies&#39; room.
 <br>
 Donna? So where you going? - Rundgren concert.
 <br>
 - Cool.
 <br>
 So what, you want a battery? &#39;Cause I can get you a battery.
 <br>
 Are they cheap? Or possibly free? $32, minimum.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll trade you our battery, plus $5 for one of your batteries.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a really sweet deal, my friend, but how about this? How about one battery for two concert tickets? We can&#39;t give up two tickets.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s either that or none of us go.
 <br>
 - So who&#39;s out? - There&#39;s always Jackie.
 <br>
 Of course, Jackie.
 <br>
 I mean, Jackie&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 But who else? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s date? Come on! You know I&#39;m breaking up with her.
 <br>
 - You guys are chumping me out.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve had to listen to her for a good hour.
 <br>
 A really long hour.
 <br>
 God hates me.
 <br>
 How can you say God hates you? At least you have a woman&#39;s love.
 <br>
 Be happy, whore.
 <br>
 This suit is for leisure.
 <br>
 But many times I wear it to get down to business.
 <br>
 Guys.
 <br>
 Randy&#39;s date is a man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m okay with it.
 <br>
 We are so cool to be okay with it.
 <br>
 I have to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 Kevin? I&#39;ll explain later.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t working.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s a Boy Scout belt.
 <br>
 The buckle&#39;s got a thing you No.
 <br>
 Michael, before you speak, please hear my words.
 <br>
 I think we should break up.
 <br>
 - Now? - You&#39;re not having a good time.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m having a good time.
 <br>
 - Really? Yeah.
 <br>
 Michael, I am so glad you don&#39;t wanna break up.
 <br>
 You were so nice to give your ticket away, so you could be with me.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That says you don&#39;t need music concerts friends.
 <br>
 You know what you need, Michael? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - Me.
 <br>
 M-E, Michael.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I guess.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just too shy to say that, lover.
 <br>
 So when were you a Boy Scout? What a great night.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s amazing what one act of civil disobedience can do for you.
 <br>
 I mean, there&#39;s a whole world that&#39;s waiting to be driven to.
 <br>
 We could go to Canada.
 <br>
 We got a new battery, what&#39;s stopping us? You know, I think Canada closes at 9:30.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, I never would have done this if you hadn&#39;t talked me into it.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t talk you into anything.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna call it a day.
 <br>
 Good night.
 <br>
 Night.
 <br>
 By the way, thanks for the ride.
 <br>
 What was that for? I just wanted to see what it was like.
 <br>
 What was it like? You were there.
 <br>
 Yeah, I wasn&#39;t ready for it.
 <br>
 What would you have done differently? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Something with my lips? Sounds good.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s try that next time.
 <br>
 When exactly is next time? Good night.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m really gonna sleep after that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s important to me That you know you are free &#39;Cause I&#39;d never want to Make you change for me Boy, we&#39;re good.
 <br>
 Yeah, really good.
 <br>
