<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 - Hey, guys.
 <br>
 - Mitch! I thought I heard a matchbox car pull up.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m short, and you&#39;re shaped like a lollipop.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not in the mood, Forman.
 <br>
 My brother Jack&#39;s wedding is tomorrow, and I don&#39;t have a date.
 <br>
 Oh, did you try Aly Richards? She&#39;ll go anywhere there&#39;s cake.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how I got her into my car.
 <br>
 But then I ate the cake, and she left.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m in a real bind here.
 <br>
 I showed up at the engagement party alone.
 <br>
 My family made so much fun of me.
 <br>
 So I said to myself, &#39;cause, of course, I was alone, that I would bring someone sizzling hot with me to the wedding.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, would you be my date? Mitch, I don&#39;t know what to say.
 <br>
 Oh, let me help you out.
 <br>
 &#34;NO!&#34; Donna, if you went with me, I might finally earn some respect from my family.
 <br>
 Let me say this for you one more time in Spanish.
 <br>
 NO! I taught him that.
 <br>
 Eric, it seems harmless.
 <br>
 No, Donna, I&#39;m sorry, but I forbid it.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Mitch, I&#39;d love to go.
 <br>
 - Donna, what the hell? - No, I forbid you to ask me questions about this.
 <br>
 - But, Donna - Let me tell you one more time in Spanish oh, hey, Donna, thanks so much for doing this.
 <br>
 Sure, but, you know, just friends.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t get to touch any of this juicy stuff.
 <br>
 No, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll even ask another couple to be, like, chaperones.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie, do you and Hyde want to go? Oh, I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 But I can&#39;t ask Steven.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still on probation for tricking him into a ballroom dancing class.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go with you, Jackie, but I warn you don&#39;t drink too much.
 <br>
 I will take advantage.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s show - Saison 6 - Episode 21 &#34;5-15&#34; Wow.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you finally sprung for cable tv.
 <br>
 Wasn&#39;t it you who said, &#34;I&#39;d rather kiss Ho Chi Minh than pay for tv&#34;? Well, your mother and I are running out of things to talk about, so I thought the extra 20 channels might help fill in the gaps.
 <br>
 Cable guy left? He forgot to hook up the basement.
 <br>
 No, he didn&#39;t so much forget as follow my &#34;don&#39;t hook up the basement&#34; instructions.
 <br>
 But, Red, for an extra 2 bucks a month, your wife and children could be enjoying full-frontal nudity.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t want you to enjoy anything.
 <br>
 I want people your age out of my house.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m only here &#39;cause you had a heart attack.
 <br>
 I only had a heart attack because you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Michael, but I&#39;m gonna have to search that bag.
 <br>
 Every time you leave my house with a backpack, I have to buy new hair spray.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t take anything.
 <br>
 This is lunch.
 <br>
 I planned a whole romantic day for me and Brooke.
 <br>
 So where are you and Brooke headed? Well, since she&#39;s having a baby, I thought I&#39;d take her to a place that kids and girls like, so I figured I&#39;d start the date off at an amusement park and we&#39;d go on a ride on the &#34;lightning whip&#34;.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna take her horseback riding up to this overlook, and then we&#39;re gonna get cozy and drink a little Bingo-Bango.
 <br>
 Oh, sweetie, you&#39;re so wrong, it makes me want to cry a little.
 <br>
 Pregnant women can&#39;t go on roller coasters, and they definitely can&#39;t drink alcohol, or bad things can happen to the baby.
 <br>
 Case in point.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Well, we didn&#39;t know any better back then.
 <br>
 I&#39;m teaching a baby-care class at the hospital.
 <br>
 If you brought Brooke, I think she&#39;d be very impressed.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Yeah, sign us up.
 <br>
 You know, there was a time that all I had to do to impress a girl was turn my eyelids inside out.
 <br>
 This baby&#39;s changing everything.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Thanks again for doing this, Donna.
 <br>
 Grandpa saw me walk in with you, and he slipped me a 20.
 <br>
 Here, you should have this.
 <br>
 See, that kind of makes me a hooker.
 <br>
 Well, hello.
 <br>
 Looks like we&#39;re sharing a table here.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your drink, here&#39;s your bread, and here&#39;s your new lover.
 <br>
 You wish.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sitting next to a goddess.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t my hair come out great tonight? Not you, shorty.
 <br>
 Her.
 <br>
 I need your help.
 <br>
 Oh, this is so easy, Fez.
 <br>
 She&#39;s like me.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a country club girl, and we&#39;re bitches.
 <br>
 We only understand one thing.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 money.
 <br>
 - How much should I give her? - No.
 <br>
 Fez, act rich.
 <br>
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
 <br>
 My name is Eric.
 <br>
 Eric, what are you doing here? I changed my work schedule so I could make sure that Mitch keeps his tiny little doll hands to himself.
 <br>
 Eric, Mitch is not a threat to you.
 <br>
 Okay, he&#39;s a perfectly harmless guy who happens to worship the ground I walk on.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s not his fault that I&#39;m eye candy.
 <br>
 Well, relax.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 Everything will be fine.
 <br>
 Welcome to the holiday hotel ballroom.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be your waiter this evening, but unlike a normal waiter, I despise and may try to destroy you.
 <br>
 Waiter, I&#39;m rich.
 <br>
 And as a rich man, I have much more money than you.
 <br>
 Fez, I&#39;m really not in the mood.
 <br>
 Sometimes I&#39;m not in the mood to count all my money, but I do it anyway because I am a fat cat.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, your bow tie is starting to unclip, fat cat.
 <br>
 Unbelievable.
 <br>
 They come to this country.
 <br>
 We give them a job they&#39;re just so ungrateful.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Christy.
 <br>
 And you are? Ferrari.
 <br>
 Fez Ferrari.
 <br>
 hahaha.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 oh, this charity car wash was a great idea, girls.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s take our shirts off! Who changed my channel? What the Steven! What the hell&#39;s the matter with you? Stealing my cable! Red, before you blow your stack, why don&#39;t you take a look at that car wash girl? She is so sudsy.
 <br>
 You drilled a hole in my floor.
 <br>
 My foot is about to drill a hole in your ass! But, Red, the car wash girls have to make $500 or their super-freaky love nest is gonna be turned into a bookstore.
 <br>
 Look, there&#39;s only one clicker, and that&#39;s upstairs.
 <br>
 My cable, my channel.
 <br>
 stop spraying me, silly, or I&#39;m gonna have to come over there and kiss you.
 <br>
 Tasha, you want a kiss, too? Wow, Tasha, you have the biggest.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 thunderstorms, which will result in a small-craft advisory on lake superior.
 <br>
 No, no! Man, look at all these preggos.
 <br>
 God, that one&#39;s walking like a gigantic duck.
 <br>
 She&#39;s definitely in her third trimester.
 <br>
 The baby probably dropped.
 <br>
 Nah, I think it&#39;s still in there.
 <br>
 It means the baby&#39;s gotten itself into the birthing position.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Man, you really know stuff.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve read every baby book in the library.
 <br>
 By the way, did you ever read that book I gave you by Dr.
 <br>
 Spock? No, I kind a lost interest when I realized it wasn&#39;t about &#34;Star Trek.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, you signed us up for this class, and that was very thoughtful.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Mr.
 <br>
 Thoughtful.
 <br>
 Man, how many kids are you having? Oh, hi, Michael.
 <br>
 Hope you&#39;re ready to talk boo-boos, burps and binkies.
 <br>
 Yeah, uh, Brooke, this is Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, the lady that told me I shouldn&#39;t take you horseback riding.
 <br>
 And, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, this is Brooke, the hot librarian I impregnated.
 <br>
 Well, I am so happy you two are here.
 <br>
 And you should be happy, because you have me as your tour guide as you make the transition to parenthood.
 <br>
 Michael.
 <br>
 But that could have been anybody.
 <br>
 Everybody knows I rule.
 <br>
 Okay, all right, okay.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get started.
 <br>
 Now, when you first bring your little bundles of joy home, they will spend almost Man, that&#39;s the life, huh? Now who can tell me what they will do with the rest of their cute, little time? - Ooh.
 <br>
 Yes, Brooke.
 <br>
 - They&#39;ll be eating.
 <br>
 Very good.
 <br>
 And what will they be eating? Hey, when you&#39;re not looking, I&#39;m gonna sneak the little guy some popcorn.
 <br>
 Michael, babies can&#39;t eat popcorn.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t even have teeth.
 <br>
 My grandma bessie doesn&#39;t have any teeth, and trust me, she ain&#39;t shy around a bucket of popcorn.
 <br>
 Well, Christy says money&#39;s great, but she wants to get to know the real me.
 <br>
 And, And, um, I really care about her.
 <br>
 So what&#39;s another fake, good quality I could pretend to have to trick her into the sack? Okay, um, okay, well, she&#39;s wearing fur, which means she must love animals, which means she must like sensitive guys.
 <br>
 Sensitive, huh? Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re good.
 <br>
 Hey, cutie.
 <br>
 Where you been? Who the hell do you think you are, talking to me like that? I&#39;m sensitive.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I guess it&#39;s a tradition for the best man to say a few words.
 <br>
 And all I really want to say is that my brother is not the only one fortunate enough to find himself in love&#39;s warm embrace.
 <br>
 So, everybody, I&#39;d like to introduce you to Donna.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 my new fianc√©e.
 <br>
 Or as I like to call her, my big, red love machine.
 <br>
 That&#39;s her.
 <br>
 Mitch, what the hell are you doing? Ooh, look at that fireball go.
 <br>
 Feisty at the table, feisty in the bedroom.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 She&#39;s feisty in my bedroom, people.
 <br>
 My bedroom.
 <br>
 Okay, he&#39;s just some lying, crazy lunatic.
 <br>
 He&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 This guy&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 And, uh, my congratulations to the happy couple.
 <br>
 This is the best wedding I have ever been to.
 <br>
 barometric pressure from a cold front out of Canada.
 <br>
 Look at all that hail in Buffalo.
 <br>
 How can you watch this? It comforts me to know that there are people out there more miserable than me, like those people in Buffalo and you.
 <br>
 You have to sit here? Why don&#39;t you go read a book? Why don&#39;t you go read a book? Because I have cable.
 <br>
 Very nice.
 <br>
 Baby says, &#34;it&#39;s tight, but not too tight, and I wuv the way you powdered my wittle bottom.
 <br>
 &#34; I never thought I&#39;d say this, but you gotta take it easy on the &#39;nads.
 <br>
 I know what I&#39;m doing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, it sounded so much easier in the books.
 <br>
 Okay, there.
 <br>
 Ooh, let&#39;s have a look.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Baby says, &#34;that&#39;s too loose.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m gonna wee-wee on daddy.
 <br>
 &#34; I just have to redo the safety pin.
 <br>
 God, why can&#39;t I do this? Oh, no.
 <br>
 Baby says, &#34;ouch, you poked me.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m gonna cry.
 <br>
 Wah! Wah!&#34; That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I give up.
 <br>
 &#34;Oh, mommy, don&#39;t leave me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to end up in state-run foster care.
 <br>
 Wah! Wah!&#34; You know, you seem normal around your family, but out in the world, you&#39;re a little nuts.
 <br>
 So it turns out I was right about Mitch.
 <br>
 So let&#39;s see, that&#39;s you, wrong.
 <br>
 Me, right.
 <br>
 All right, you don&#39;t have to rub it in.
 <br>
 Uh, I think I do, Donna So rub-a-dub-dub, I&#39;m right.
 <br>
 I am humiliated! The only way I&#39;m gonna get my pride back is to kick your ass! So I&#39;m challenging you to a fight.
 <br>
 That is, unless you&#39;re too chicken.
 <br>
 What is this, third grade? Okay, here&#39;s what I just heard.
 <br>
 ba-gawk, ooh, third grade, ooh.
 <br>
 Okay, you can stop doing that.
 <br>
 - Bawk, I can stop doing that, bawk.
 <br>
 - Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;ll fight you.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Tomorrow! 5:15, the playground.
 <br>
 You be there! Um, why not just do it at 5? I have swimming lessons! thank you so much for helping me with Christy.
 <br>
 She was telling me what she did last summer at camp, and I think she might be a whore.
 <br>
 - So if there&#39;s anything I can do for you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - Actually, Fez, there is.
 <br>
 When the bride tosses the bouquet, I really want to catch it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s such a sweet and magical moment, so I need you to knock some of those fat sluts out of my way.
 <br>
 I will make those weebles wobble.
 <br>
 And they will fall down.
 <br>
 Fez Ferrari, you&#39;re so rich and sensitive, I think I might go all the way with you.
 <br>
 But only if you get everyone out of my way so I can catch the bouquet.
 <br>
 How many bouquets do they throw? One.
 <br>
 Aye.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see, who do I help? Old friend, new whore? Old friend, new whore? Oh, what am I saying? Do the right thing, Fez.
 <br>
 Okay, I don&#39;t know who gave you a tattoo, but that is not good parenting.
 <br>
 Look, Michael, I don&#39;t want to talk about it.
 <br>
 I thought I was ready, but today I found out I don&#39;t know how to use a diaper.
 <br>
 We are gonna be covered in poo.
 <br>
 Look, I think you&#39;re underestimating us, all right? Especially me.
 <br>
 These beautiful hands aren&#39;t just made for foreplay.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 I remember the first time I baby sat for my little brother and he power-dooked all over himself, right? So I got my mom&#39;s salad tongs and pulled off his pants, and then I grabbed him by the ankles and took him outside and hosed him off.
 <br>
 And voil√†.
 <br>
 Oh, Michael, it&#39;s so perfect.
 <br>
 See, you got the brains and the maternal instincts, and I know how to wrap ass.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna do this together, and we&#39;re gonna be fine.
 <br>
 &#34;Ooh, daddy ,that&#39;s just how I like it.
 <br>
 &#34; You&#39;re really starting to creep me out.
 <br>
 winds variable out of the northeast, oh, weather kicks ass.
 <br>
 Forman, I&#39;m your bud, so I&#39;m rooting for you in this fight.
 <br>
 But business is business, so I got 50 bucks on the little guy.
 <br>
 Well, I see the chicken showed up for his beating.
 <br>
 How can I be a chicken if I showed up for the fight? You know, it&#39;s funny, &#39;cause what I just heard was chicken bawk! Fight bawk! Eric, as someone that has been punched a lot, I have some advice.
 <br>
 Do not move to a new country and try to fit in at high school.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman, come back here so we can go over the rules.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, one last thing.
 <br>
 You know when we&#39;re play-fighting and you grab my wrist and I go, &#34;ow! Ow! Ow!&#34;? That doesn&#39;t really hurt.
 <br>
 Okay? So.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 don&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 What? The Forman death grip? Man, I was really counting on that.
 <br>
 What are you doing here? I don&#39;t want to fight you.
 <br>
 I was just trying to act tough so I can get my self-respect back.
 <br>
 By threatening me? It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a way out of this that&#39;ll make us both look good.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll tell everyone that we worked it out like gentlemen, and now we&#39;re the best of friends.
 <br>
 Well, no.
 <br>
 Mitch, look, Donna was really nice to you, and you humiliated her.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t let you treat people like that.
 <br>
 Today I&#39;m I&#39;m standing up for all humanity.
 <br>
 Would you do it for a 1968 G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe desert rat edition with the original mess kit? Please.
 <br>
 I have three of those.
 <br>
 - The French version? - G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Jacques.
 <br>
 It does exist.
 <br>
 We got a deal? Well, I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s not gonna be a fight here.
 <br>
 Uh, guys, we worked out our differences, and basically, he&#39;s a really great guy.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s doing the chicken thing behind me.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 He&#39;s really good at it.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not the only thing I&#39;m good at, cherry pie.
 <br>
 All right, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re dead.
 <br>
 Ooh! ooh! ohh! Start the car, Mom! Start the car! temperatures in the.
