 <br>
 If they really like me theyd leave me alone! Man, last night we could hear the Pinciottis fighting all the way across the driveway.
 <br>
 It was horrible.
 <br>
 It was all: Youre the devil Midge OH Bob, shut up OH Bob, shut up, thats classic! Man if you get any dumber youre gonna need a helmet.
 <br>
 Bummer for Donna huh, cant believe theyre sleeping in seperate bedrooms.
 <br>
 Yeah I know.
 <br>
 Wait I dont know, what are you talking about? Well, Hyde knows something about Donna that Eric does not know.
 <br>
 This is an interesting development, lets watch Midge is sleeping in the guestbedroom man.
 <br>
 How did you know that? Did Donna tell you that? Look Forman, its not a big deal.
 <br>
 I guess shes just telling me stuff shes not telling you.
 <br>
 See, this is why communication is so important.
 <br>
 Now, Michael and I always Excuse me, we were talking about Donna and me and how Oh hush, no-one cares! Now, Michael never keeps secrets from me, do you sweetie? Huh? Oh, no, never.
 <br>
 Michael, you hesitated! Why did you hesitate? No I didnt hesitate! Did I Hyde? Yep.
 <br>
 Fez?! Oh yes if you really loved her you would not have hesitated.
 <br>
 Conversation Michael! The van! NOW! Noooooo, noooo I didnt hesitate! You guys are DEAD! Well, so what do you think birthday boy? Cause I think its gonna be fun! Well you know, good food, old friends, this might not be too bad Kitty.

 <br>
 TED: Hey thanks! Hoehaa! Riiiight.

 <br>

 <br>
 When you say it like that Red it sounds stupid.
 <br>
 Okay Midge, say it so it doesnt sound stupid.
 <br>
 Okay here now maybe this cheese toast will make your birthday happy.
 <br>
 No Kitty, I think I have lost my appetite God that is a great looking T-bone! Is there butter on this? TED: Hoehaa! Riiight.
 <br>
 Now Im gonna eat this steak, but first, Im gonna make a birthday wish.
 <br>
 Here it is: I wish everyone would shut up! Something wrong? No.
 <br>
 So, is there anything on your mind? Someone you might wanna talk to? No ERIC in his mind: Dont take no for an answer, she talked to Hyde, get her to talk to you.

 <br>
 MIDGE: Wait a minute! What do you mean, no offence? TED: Well I mean, dont be offended.
 <br>
 MIDGE: Oh! Listen, you insult my wife one more time you&#39;re gonna be wearing your steak as a hat! TED: Im sorry! MIDGE: Oh Bob that was so sweet! Like in highschool when you used to hit people just for looking at me.
 <br>

 <br>
 left my wallet in the car Midge! MIDGE: OH, I left my sex with Bob in the car! Check please! Ah there you go, thats for you! Come on Kitty Donna wouldnt even talk to me, she just kept sticking her tongue down my throat.
 <br>
 Oh boohoo Forman! You get to fool around with a totally hot chick and you never have to talk about her feelings.
 <br>
 Ts, you poor french-kissing bastard.
 <br>
 Yeah Hydes right.
 <br>
 One time I asked Jackie what was wrong, and she didnt shut up for like three straight days.
 <br>
 You know Kelso, sometimes you do not know what you have until it is gone.
 <br>
 And then someone else has it, and it is not you, and then that someone else is really happy.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? You dont know what hes talking about? I say get the helmet Kelso put this on! Shut up, Im not putting the helmet on! And what are you talking about? Ill tell you what Im talking about if you put the helmet on.
 <br>
 FINE! If you dont take care of Jackie, you are going to lose her.
 <br>
 Pfffttt.
 <br>
 thats just stupid! Look Hyde, all I know is that youre talking to my girlfriend and I dont like it.
 <br>
 Hey man, I was friends with Donna before you ever became her little boyfriend.
 <br>
 Hyde, youre pissing me off! Why dont you think Forman, you get to make out with one of the hottest chicks in Wisconsin, while Im being all sympathetic and relating my crappy life to her, and Im pissing you off? Youre supposed to be the friend and IM supposed to be the make-out guy! Now that I think about it, youre pissing ME off! What the hell kind of a world are we living in? Hey, lets date other people, hey, lets date other people but ditch them and do it in a car! Thats enlightend? In my days we called them degenerates and we stoned them! With big rocks! Oh, you did not.
