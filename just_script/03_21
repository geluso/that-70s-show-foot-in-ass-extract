 [R&amp;B Ballad] - [Slurping] - [Jukebox: Continues] [Sighs] That is the saddest sound in the world.
 <br>
 [Loud Slurp] [Sighs] No more soda for Fez.
 <br>
 And no more money for- - Fez, do you need me to buy you another soda? - Eric, you do not buy soda.
 <br>
 You only rent it.
 <br>
 You know what I mean.
 <br>
 I mean, you pee it out.
 <br>
 Yeah, I got it.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ll have to remember that phone number.
 <br>
 - Hi, Fez! - Caroline! What are you doing? I knew you&#39;d be in here.
 <br>
 I saw you had the large root beer.
 <br>
 - Caroline, you have to leave me alone.
 <br>
 - But I wanna be with you! But I told you we&#39;re through because I am with Donna.
 <br>
 Yes? Remember? Donna? Well, you&#39;d better be, because if you&#39;re not that means you still love me.
 <br>
 And if you still love me but you&#39;re not with me, I&#39;ll make you pay.
 <br>
 That would only be scary if I was lying about Donna and me.
 <br>
 [Weak Chuckle] Well, if you are lying I&#39;ll know, because I&#39;ll be watching you.
 <br>
 Go ahead.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not afraid.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, I&#39;m afraid.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong? When I broke up with crazy Caroline, I told her I was dating Donna.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not dating Donna.
 <br>
 You are dating Donna.
 <br>
 Hey! Could I borrow Donna? Sure.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! I don&#39;t wanna blink, &#39;cause I&#39;m afraid to miss even a second of your cuteness.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s torture for me too.
 <br>
 I could tear your eyelids off.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go, Michael, to a place where our love is understood.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, while you&#39;re there check out the new monkey house.
 <br>
 It never ends with those two.
 <br>
 I love you, I love you, I love you- [Raspberry] Guys, it won&#39;t last.
 <br>
 Look, an object in an unnatural state must return to its natural state.
 <br>
 Thus, Kelso and Jackie&#39;ll have a fight any day.
 <br>
 Really? It&#39;s simple physics.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys, you know what? We should get a pool going.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll draw days for five bucks.
 <br>
 If they fight on your day, you win the pot.
 <br>
 The pot? If that&#39;s the prize, I am in.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Donna, I can&#39;t thank you enough for agreeing to helPme with Caroline.
 <br>
 Hey, anything for a friend.
 <br>
 But if she tries to hurt me, I&#39;m using you as a shield.
 <br>
 Likewise.
 <br>
 So, while you&#39;re with Fez, looks like Forman&#39;ll be living the single life.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Oh, now you won&#39;t get to take me to see The Turning Point.
 <br>
 The ballerina movie? Oh, no.
 <br>
 Need somethin&#39;, Bob? Well, it&#39;s a funny thing.
 <br>
 The wife and I, we&#39;re taking out a second mortgage on the house.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s not the funny part &#39;cause we&#39;re pretty much destitute.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a little bit funny, Bob.
 <br>
 Anyways I&#39;m looking at the deed to the property and the map shows that I own a couple feet of your driveway and a little bit of your garage.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you like to own a little bit of my foot in your ass? I wouldn&#39;t, to be quite honest.
 <br>
 It&#39;s free.
 <br>
 So, our first date.
 <br>
 I guess we&#39;re officially a couple now.
 <br>
 A couple of knuckleheads, huh? [Sighs] May we laugh.
 <br>
 - Oh! There she is.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Showtime.
 <br>
 - [Coin Drops] - [Slaps Side Panel] [Disco] [Continues] [Continues] [Groans] [Yawning] Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 So, should I watch a ballerina movie or Get Smart? - [Snaps] - Get Smart it is.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I said Get Smart.
 <br>
 [TV: Theme] I&#39;m sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 Did you want the last piece? [Laughs] Well, it&#39;s too late.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I said too late.
 <br>
 Yeah, that was me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 That was me.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde! Welcome to the bachelor life.
 <br>
 You know, without Donna I&#39;ve realized that I can revert to my natural state.
 <br>
 I&#39;m dirty, I&#39;m lazy and I don&#39;t wear pants.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m just like you.
 <br>
 - No, no.
 <br>
 See, I&#39;m an original.
 <br>
 A Warhol.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just a print.
 <br>
 Those are some pretty strong words coming from a guy who&#39;s wearing pants.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 This is my favorite part.
 <br>
 [TV: Tires Screech] Oh, yeah, that was me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 That was me.
 <br>
 ! Bob, that&#39;s my stuff! You put the hell back my stuff! Sorry, Red.
 <br>
 It was in my part of the garage.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? What is he talking about? Kitty- Kitty, let me talk to him.
 <br>
 Bob, get the hell out of my garage! Fine.
 <br>
 There ya go.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey, how goes the pool? Great.
 <br>
 I sold 15 spots.
 <br>
 I got today.
 <br>
 You got tomorrow.
 <br>
 What? That bites.
 <br>
 They&#39;re never gonna last until then.
 <br>
 Who won&#39;t last until what? - What? Huh? - Huh? What? Oh.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I, uh- I smashed a couple of toes.
 <br>
 We&#39;re waiting to see how long before the nails fall off.
 <br>
 I wanna play.
 <br>
 Uh, Michael, you&#39;re a little busy right now.
 <br>
 But, Jackie, those toenails could fall off at any minute.
 <br>
 Hey! Me! I&#39;m sorry, puddin&#39;.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Now I feel like pudding.
 <br>
 Hey! Me too! Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Well, I believe this is mine.
 <br>
 Thank you all for playing.
 <br>
 What? That wasn&#39;t a fight.
 <br>
 Okay, we&#39;ll let Fez decide.
 <br>
 Fez, fight or no? Sorry, Eric.
 <br>
 I have to say no.
 <br>
 - The pool goes on.
 <br>
 - But, Fez, l- It goes on.
 <br>
 Ah, what the hell? Now I want pudding.
 <br>
 I&#39;m with you, brother.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s roll.
 <br>
 Thank God.
 <br>
 I thought they&#39;d never leave.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t get all gussied up for me.
 <br>
 I just came by to make sure you&#39;re okay.
 <br>
 You know, not too lonely without me.
 <br>
 What, are you kidding me? I&#39;m having a great time! L- I feel like I&#39;ve really learned a lot about Eric.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re having fun.
 <br>
 Oh, but what about you? Pretending to be Fez&#39;s girlfriend has to be kind of a drag.
 <br>
 Right? No! Fez is great.
 <br>
 Last night he took me to play putt-putt.
 <br>
 And tonight he&#39;s taking me on a hayride.
 <br>
 Fez is so charming.
 <br>
 You know, I can see why Caroline&#39;s stalking him.
 <br>
 - You know, I would&#39;ve taken you on a hayride- - Eric, Eric.
 <br>
 The important thing is that you&#39;re having a great time, and I&#39;m having a great time.
 <br>
 So have a great time.
 <br>
 No, you have a great time.
 <br>
 Oh, I will.
 <br>
 Well, I will too.
 <br>
 [Door OPens, Closes] Eric, I cannot thank you enough for lending me your girlfriend.
 <br>
 It feels so good to be in a normal, healthy relationship.
 <br>
 Fez, it&#39;s a fake, pretend relationship.
 <br>
 You say tomato, I say tomato.
 <br>
 Fez, &#34;to-mah-to.
 <br>
 &#34; What? You say &#34;to-mah-to.
 <br>
 &#34; Why would I say &#34;to-mah-to&#34;? That&#39;s not even a word, dummy.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay, Eric.
 <br>
 Different strokes for different strokes.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 All I know is, if I was married to a woman like Donna it would be heavens.
 <br>
 Oh, the high jinks we would get into.
 <br>
 Lucy, I&#39;m home! Ricky, is that you? [Braying Laughter] Lucy, what happened to you? Oh, Ricky, I was making molasses cookies for your band and I had an accident! Oh, Lucy.
 <br>
 - Uh-oh.
 <br>
 - Ricky! - We&#39;re stuck! - [Doorbell Rings] I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 Ayayayayay.
 <br>
 ! [Speaking Spanish] [Grunts] Hi, neighbors! Lucy, I brought you that flour for your cookies.
 <br>
 Oh, Ethel, you&#39;re a pal! Gee, Fred, would it hurt you to hug me like that? Well, probably not.
 <br>
 But why take the chance? Hey, Fred, we got a sticky situation here.
 <br>
 You wanna help us out? Sure, Rick.
 <br>
 Watch it, Fred! Boy, you kids really are stuck.
 <br>
 [Grunts] Waaaaah! Waaaaah! Waaaaah! Oh, Lucy.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m off to romance our lady.
 <br>
 Oh- Hey, Fez, Donna hasn&#39;t been I don&#39;t know, like, mentioning me or anything? No.
 <br>
 Well, that- that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good, &#39;cause I haven&#39;t been talking about her either.
 <br>
 Of course, I&#39;ve been alone, so I&#39;d just be talking to myself.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s not normal.
 <br>
 Have to be pretty crazy to talk to myself, wouldn&#39;t I? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I would.
 <br>
 Okay, I gotta get some pants.
 <br>
 [TV] Damn.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Oh, hey, Kelso, uh Pam Macy called and she said she had a really great time making out with you last night.
 <br>
 - Michael! - No! No! We did not! Fight! Fight! Fight! - No fair, man.
 <br>
 - Shut up! - My day&#39;s almost over! Now, hurry up and fight! - What? - [Gasps, Squeals] - Oh, no! - Would you watch it! - Isn&#39;t Kelso a klutz? I think you should hit him.
 <br>
 Steven, why are you trying to make us fight? &#39;Cause I&#39;ve got today in the pool.
 <br>
 Come on, Jackie, hit him! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I get it.
 <br>
 The pool wasn&#39;t about Steven&#39;s toenails.
 <br>
 These idiots bet on when you and I would fight.
 <br>
 Kelso! Are you gonna take that, man? She called your friends idiots.
 <br>
 You better start kickin&#39; some ass! No, wait.
 <br>
 The pool was about us? Damn! I wish I had a piece of that! You would wager against our love? Well, damn, Jackie! In a lifetime, how often do you have a run at a sure thing? - [Groans] - Game over! - [Laughs] - What&#39;s all the racket? Oh, that&#39;s just the sweet sound of me winning 75 bucks.
 <br>
 Aha.
 <br>
 ! Not so fast, cheater.
 <br>
 ! It&#39;s two minutes past midnight, which means it&#39;s the next day, which means you lose.
 <br>
 Ah! Serves you right.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Oh, shut up, Michael.
 <br>
 Looks like the winner is &#34;R.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 &#34; Who&#39;s R.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 ? I believe this is mine.
 <br>
 Thank you all very much.
 <br>
 All right, hand over my preserves.
 <br>
 They were in our garage, and now they&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s terrible, Kitty.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you sit down and relax with some toast and homemade jam? - Jam? - Yeah.
 <br>
 We found it in our garage.
 <br>
 It&#39;s our garage! And that&#39;s my jam! Bon aPPétit.
 <br>
 ! You know, you two just don&#39;t get it, do you? That jam was on my property.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll show you the deed.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] There&#39;s my lot.
 <br>
 There&#39;s yours.
 <br>
 There&#39;s the property line right there.
 <br>
 Oops.
 <br>
 Well- [Clears Throat] Looks like I own part of your property.
 <br>
 I, uh- I will not stand for this trickery! You get out of my house! No problem.
 <br>
 - [Projector Running] - Okay.
 <br>
 No one answered the phone at Eric&#39;s house.
 <br>
 What could he be doing? Where could he go with no pants? Donna, when we&#39;re in public, you are with me.
 <br>
 Eric is dead to you.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Pardon me.
 <br>
 Move it! Oh, boy.
 <br>
 Here comes trouble.
 <br>
 Caroline.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I was just offering my girlfriend Donna a sip from my straw.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t care about germs, because she has had her tongue in my mouth.
 <br>
 You know what I think? I think this is all an act.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think you&#39;re really dating.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah? Well-Well, maybe- maybe this will convince you.
 <br>
 Come on, Donna.
 <br>
 Put some leg into it.
 <br>
 Give me a break.
 <br>
 If you were really together, you&#39;d have at least gotten to second base by now.
 <br>
 You know, when you are right, you are right.
 <br>
 All right, all right.
 <br>
 Enough.
 <br>
 Caroline, Fez doesn&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 Is that true, Fez? Yes.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I guess we really are over.
 <br>
 Okay! Enjoy your movie.
 <br>
 [Movie: Classical] - Ow.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - Hey, Eric.
 <br>
 Lookin&#39; good.
 <br>
 Call me.
 <br>
 [Clicks Tongue] Eric, what are you doing here? Are you kidding me? It&#39;s The Turning Point.
 <br>
 I love ballet movies.
 <br>
 They make you think, you know? How did their feet get so pointy? That&#39;s a mystery I&#39;m determined to solve.
 <br>
 - What? - You miss me.
 <br>
 Well you missed me.
 <br>
 I really did.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Our date is not over.
 <br>
 Now, good day, sir.
 <br>
 - But, Fez- - I said good day.
 <br>
 Fez, I&#39;m not going anywhere.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Then good day.
 <br>
 - [Donna] Fez! - I said good day! Lucy, these brownies are wonderful.
 <br>
 They make me feel silly.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you just love those dried mint flakes? Someone sold &#39;em to me off the street! Um, I don&#39;t think these are mint flakes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m flyin&#39;! Lucy, you got some &#39;splainin&#39; to do.
 <br>
