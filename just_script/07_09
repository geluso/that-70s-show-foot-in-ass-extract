 Man, I can&#39;t believe thanksgiving&#39;s tomorrow.
 <br>
 It&#39;s such a special time of the year, when like to give thanks, get fez drunk and dress him up like a lady pilgrim.
 <br>
 Well, the joke&#39;s on you because this year I&#39;m getting into the dress before I get drunk.
 <br>
 Ah, touch√©.
 <br>
 Well, so long as it happens.
 <br>
 I had thanksgiving dinner last night with brooke and the baby so I could be here tonight for fez and the dress.
 <br>
 Hey guys.
 <br>
 I got something really different planned for thanksgiving.
 <br>
 But instead of telling you about it, I&#39;m gonna let it wash over you.
 <br>
 But, eric, maybe you could let some soap and water wash over you, &#39;cause since you&#39;ve been out of work, you&#39;re a little bummy welcome to the grand illusion come on in and see what&#39;s happenin&#39; pay the price get the ticket for the show Is that Styx? And they just announced a concert thanksgiving night.
 <br>
 Now if we camp out for tickets, by tomorrow, we could be watching five guys in spandex suits shaking their hair sweat on teenage girls.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 even if I liked Styx, which would mean I was born without ears, I still can&#39;t go.
 <br>
 My dad wants me and Angie to open the record store by midnight tomorrow.
 <br>
 Oh, man, Angie is so pretty.
 <br>
 You know, looking at Angie is like looking at Something else pretty.
 <br>
 Well said.
 <br>
 Donna, you in for Styx? Eric, I&#39;m a DJ.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t be seen at a Styx concert.
 <br>
 It&#39;s in my contract.
 <br>
 Well, Fez, what do you say, my man from another land? Eric, where I come from, we have a saying.
 <br>
 Ecch.
 <br>
 Styx.
 <br>
 Remember, kids, music is joy, comfort, A Band Aid for a wounded soul.
 <br>
 And if you get people to believe that crap, you&#39;re gonna sell a lot of records.
 <br>
 Here are the keys to the store.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 I just figure whoever hasn&#39;t been in prison should hold the keys.
 <br>
 I thought she&#39;d do that, So I made an extra set for you.
 <br>
 Everybody gets keys.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know me very well, but you&#39;re gonna have to make three of everything.
 <br>
 I&#39;m starting to get you a little bit.
 <br>
 You&#39;re funny.
 <br>
 All right, well as co-manager of this record store, My first order is A pizza.
 <br>
 Are you crazy? We have to start unloading records.
 <br>
 Hey, look, I don&#39;t know about these other jokers, But I am here to help, So, if you need to get anything off of one of these high shelves, I&#39;ll be happy to watch you reach for it.
 <br>
 All right guys, we got a ton of box to unpack, posters to hang, so let&#39;s hit it.
 <br>
 I love hittin&#39; it.
 <br>
 I love that you taught me to love hittin&#39; it.
 <br>
 You know, this is the first time we&#39;ve ever hit it at Hey, this place doesn&#39;t have a name yet.
 <br>
 you should call it &#34;hot wax records,&#34; but with a z- Recordzzz.
 <br>
 Z&#39;s are so Rock&#39;n&#39;roll.
 <br>
 &#34;funk man&#39;s house of funk.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;funk man&#39;s funky house of funk.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Funky man&#39;s funky house of hittin&#39; it.
 <br>
 &#34; You guys writing this done or what? Steven it&#39;s too complicated.
 <br>
 You need something that sounds hot and upscale.
 <br>
 You should call it &#34;Jackie&#34;.
 <br>
 If you want it hot and upscale, you should call it : &#34;Dijon mustard&#34; What about, huh, like &#34;headfood&#34;? &#34;Headsies.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;The head!&#34; This is kinda cool.
 <br>
 &#34;The Head.
 <br>
 &#34; - &#34;The Head.
 <br>
 &#34; - &#34;The Head.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;The Head.
 <br>
 &#34; I smell something burning.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be us.
 <br>
 Man.
 <br>
 We just came up with the best name for the record store.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, um.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 &#34;The funky mustard house.
 <br>
 &#34; I thought we settled down &#34;Jackie&#34;! I just had it, and then it popped out of my head.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it! &#34;Poppers&#34; This is a chain.
 <br>
 All the stores are called &#34;Grooves.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, that&#39;s why we have that sign.
 <br>
 All right well, let&#39;s call it a day and hit it hard again tomorrow.
 <br>
 Good work everyone.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 I just remembered the name.
 <br>
 &#34;Lumpy&#39;s.
 <br>
 &#34; No, it wasn&#39;t called &#34;Lumpy&#39;s.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, my store is gonna be called &#34;Lumpy&#39;s.
 <br>
 &#34; That  70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 09 &#34;You can&#39;t always get what you want.
 <br>
 &#34; First one here.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys getting in line for Styx tickets, too? Yeah, right.
 <br>
 If we weren&#39;t late for this party, we&#39;d kick your ass.
 <br>
 Styx rules.
 <br>
 What was that, dork? I  said enjoy your party.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Did I miss it? Are there any tickets left? Black sabbath&#39;s been sold out for weeks.
 <br>
 No, Styx.
 <br>
 I prefer a more lush, orchestral sound.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you&#39;re the only one.
 <br>
 Just give me the damn ticket.
 <br>
 Man, hyde, this listening pit is an awesome idea.
 <br>
 Yeah, you made a place for people to hang out, listen to music and feel up angie and stuff.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not what this pit is for, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s for listening to records and feeling up jackie and stuff.
 <br>
 Steven&#39;s so innovative.
 <br>
 You know, he designed this whole thing from scratch.
 <br>
 Um, this is exactly eric&#39;s basement.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just jealous because steven&#39;s successful and eric&#39;s all bummy.
 <br>
 What is all this? What happened to the soft rock section? I put it in the alley.
 <br>
 See, that way, if somebody comes in asking for barry manilow, I can send &#39;em outside and lock the door.
 <br>
 Steven, the store is very important to me.
 <br>
 When I was 8 years old, Santa asked me what I wanted for christmas, and I said a record store.
 <br>
 You know what I got? A pony.
 <br>
 What 8-year-old girl wants a damn pony? You know, one year I asked for a damn pony and got a car.
 <br>
 I just want the store to be great.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I think this pit makes the store great.
 <br>
 Really? Did you go to business school? Well, he did a lot of business at school.
 <br>
 Fine, I&#39;ll get rid of the pit, but I want that entire wall covered in zeppelin.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t.
 <br>
 You know that research paper that I gave you that you probably smoked? Well, it says that zeppelin scares people over 30.
 <br>
 Good, because people over They move to Florida to play golf.
 <br>
 Man, Angie is so awesome and classy.
 <br>
 She&#39;s like the first page of a &#34;playboy&#34; layout.
 <br>
 You know, before you see her cans.
 <br>
 Do you know that all that stuff about those girls is made up? Yeah, they&#39;re not really librarians or horse trainers or scientists.
 <br>
 They&#39;re just whores.
 <br>
 I wish someone would rub my shoulders like this.
 <br>
 Hey, whatcha cookin&#39;, good-lookin&#39;? Guess who got a ticket to see styx in concert tonight.
 <br>
 Tonight? Honey, it&#39;s thanksgiving.
 <br>
 Yeah, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
 <br>
 Mom, this ticket was really hard to get.
 <br>
 Was it harder to get than the holiday traditions this family has built through decades of love and sacrifice? Much harder.
 <br>
 Thanks for understanding.
 <br>
 There&#39;s my beautiful bride.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in the garage.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 None of the kids are coming for dinner tonight.
 <br>
 Laurie&#39;s in canada, steven has his store, and now eric is going to a concert.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no point in me even making my special yams.
 <br>
 What? Kitty, I love those yams.
 <br>
 They&#39;re among the top three reasons I married you.
 <br>
 Well, I can&#39;t make them if I&#39;m sad.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 You get started on the yams, and I&#39;ll go talk to eric.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Gosh, my shoulders are sore from all this cooking.
 <br>
 Think you could rub &#39;em a little? Kitty, it&#39;s thanksgiving, not christmas.
 <br>
 Styx, Kelso? All right, fine! I like styx, okay? And I don&#39;t care if anybody knows it! Well, that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t tell anyone.
 <br>
 Why aren&#39;t you putting the records in the bins? What bins? The ones I ordered.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 I never ordered the bins.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 That would never happen at &#34;Jackie.
 <br>
 &#34; What are we gonna do? There&#39;s no bins.
 <br>
 no bins! Hey, look, man, I&#39;ll take care of it, all right? But it&#39;s gonna cost you.
 <br>
 Listening  pit comes back, Zeppelin goes up on that wall, and I want you to remove the smoke detectors from the back office.
 <br>
 Whatever you want.
 <br>
 Oh, and also, my creepy friend gets to hold your hand for two minutes.
 <br>
 That-- that would be me.
 <br>
 All right, back off.
 <br>
 I want to be the first one of us who gets to touch her.
 <br>
 You, too, with the Styx? Donna, it&#39;s just a-- it&#39;s just a present for my friend, um um F Fez.
 <br>
 Damn it.
 <br>
 Outta my way, dad.
 <br>
 Time for me to rock.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not goin&#39; to the concert.
 <br>
 - What? Why not? - Look, every family has its holiday traditions.
 <br>
 Some sing, others play charades-- in our family, someone always cries.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ll be damned if it&#39;s gonna be your mother crying tonight.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t see her like that.
 <br>
 I-I love her.
 <br>
 She threatened not to make the yams, Just get the hell back in the house.
 <br>
 okay, here&#39;s the situation.
 <br>
 It&#39;s thanksgiving night.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s closed.
 <br>
 We need to find a hundred record bins by midnight.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the same damn thing every year.
 <br>
 I have a question.
 <br>
 How does hair know to grow? And how far inside your head does it go? Does it touch your brain? Okay.
 <br>
 I think we need to get Jerry Garcia here some coffee.
 <br>
 Let the girl rap.
 <br>
 I was into it.
 <br>
 I like to think about my head.
 <br>
 The head.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the name.
 <br>
 I saved the day.
 <br>
 Know what would be perfect for the records? Those boxes that milk bottles come in.
 <br>
 They&#39;re, like, crates or crepes.
 <br>
 Crepes! How good are crepes? That&#39;ll work, man.
 <br>
 We need, like, milk crates.
 <br>
 Well, how are we gonna drink all that milk? Ooh! Wait.
 <br>
 We need 50 boxes of cookies.
 <br>
 No, wastoid.
 <br>
 W-we&#39;ll steal the crates.
 <br>
 It&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 Milk crates.
 <br>
 Milk crates.
 <br>
 Milk crates.
 <br>
 Milky craties.
 <br>
 Okay, my valium&#39;s starting to wear off.
 <br>
 What&#39;s happening with those boxes? Man, we just thought of the perfect solution.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna go get some of those - The head.
 <br>
 - Crepes.
 <br>
 - Poppers.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be back.
 <br>
 Why is it every time I leave the room, you guys do this? It&#39;s thanksgiving.
 <br>
 Some people bake pies.
 <br>
 We bake ourselves.
 <br>
 Thank you for opening up your home to me on this special day.
 <br>
 This family is all about love.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Spirit-crushing, tyrannical love.
 <br>
 Drop that tone of voice, or you&#39;ll be wearing that turkey like a football helmet.
 <br>
 Okay, now, everybody, take a feather from the paper turkey and write down something you&#39;re thankful for.
 <br>
 And then we&#39;ll all pick feathers and guess who wrote them.
 <br>
 Any questions? This is kind of off topic, but where can I put my belt? I&#39;ll go first.
 <br>
 &#34;I&#39;m thankful for my mother/wife.
 <br>
 &#34;My life is meaningless without her.
 <br>
 &#34; Whoopsy.
 <br>
 I got mine.
 <br>
 It would&#39;ve sounded better if someone else had read it.
 <br>
 &#34;I&#39;m thankful you have pecan pie.
 <br>
 &#34;You do have pecan pie, right? &#34;Because I turned down an invitation &#34;that involved pecan pie.
 <br>
 &#34; Hmm.
 <br>
 Bob? &#34;I&#39;m thankful I didn&#39;t waste my day at a really fun concert.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;This way I can work on becoming a bitter old man&#34; &#34;whose only happiness is destroying his son&#39;s life.
 <br>
 &#34; Kitty, hand me the turkey.
 <br>
 I think I got red&#39;s.
 <br>
 Cause the only words I can repeat are, &#34;eric, little&#34; and a word that starts with &#34;mother.
 <br>
 &#34; Mother? That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 It takes a pretty hard left turn.
 <br>
 Thanksgiving is ruined! Don&#39;t look at me.
 <br>
 Dad&#39;s the one who cursed on turkey.
 <br>
 Kitty! Bob, touch my yams and die.
 <br>
 Look at all this stuff I gotta eat.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I&#39;ll distract him.
 <br>
 Jackie, give me your lipstick.
 <br>
 Okay, but you picked a really weird time to get into makeup, donna.
 <br>
 I love it when you whore yourself for the good of the group.
 <br>
 Hey,  you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s, um, that&#39;s a sexy milk truck you got there.
 <br>
 Really? Nah.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 That big cow on the side is really, um Sexy.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t talked to a woman in four months.
 <br>
 Oh, come here, big guy.
 <br>
 She&#39;s hugging him.
 <br>
 Okay, come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s grab everything.
 <br>
 Hurry up.
 <br>
 Or slow down.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like to see where this goes.
 <br>
 How could you think it would be okay to miss thanksgiving? You might as well just rip my heart out and drown it in my delicious giblet gravy.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not just thanksgiving.
 <br>
 You used to have goals and ambition.
 <br>
 But now, one week you&#39;re chasing butterflies, the next week, you&#39;re skating around the neighborhood dressed like liberace.
 <br>
 Did it ever occur to you guys that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing? Okay? I&#39;m scared.
 <br>
 Of what, honey? We got rid of the spooky lamp in your room.
 <br>
 Look, my whole life, I&#39;ve been trying to please other people.
 <br>
 So I feel like I don&#39;t know who I am or know what I want to do with my life.
 <br>
 You need a government job, like a mailman, something simple and repetitive.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 You know he doesn&#39;t do well in snow.
 <br>
 What about this? Margie&#39;s sonis a chiropractor, and she seems very happy.
 <br>
 I just I don&#39;t want to wake up in five years and hate my life.
 <br>
 That&#39;s unavoidable.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I just need more time to think.
 <br>
 You know what I got for my 18th birthday? A draft notice and a malaria vaccine.
 <br>
 I never had time to think.
 <br>
 Yeah, but, dad, don&#39;t you think it would&#39;ve been helpful if you did? All right, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give you six months.
 <br>
 But if you haven&#39;t picked something by then, you&#39;ll do that chiropractic thing that your mother suggested.
 <br>
 Dad, I-I don&#39;t even know what that is.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, it&#39;s perfect for you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like a doctor, but you don&#39;t have to be as smart.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I had to kiss that milkman.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;ve done worse for less.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Was it milky? Shut up.
 <br>
 So what do you think? I think I see a lot of records in milk crates.
 <br>
 Where are the bins like the other stores have? - Dad, I forgot to tell you - Forgot to tell me what? Uh, what she forgot to tell you was that it was my idea.
 <br>
 See, I thought it would look cool.
 <br>
 You know, like we, um, stole &#39;em or something.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t much like it, but we&#39;ll give it a shot.
 <br>
 Why is Jackie behind the cash register? Hey, funny girl, get your hands off my money! That was really nice of you.
 <br>
 I know, and now you owe me.
 <br>
 I want black lights, bigger speakers and a little thing called the 5-day weekend.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Was Hyde being mean to you? You know, I can&#39;t, uh, beat him up for you, but, uh, I can get Donna to.
 <br>
 No, he was great.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, I&#39;ve been waiting for this day my whole life, and now I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do with myself.
 <br>
 Well, I think that you need to take some time for you.
 <br>
 And may I suggest an evening out with Michael Kelso? Dinner, drinks and a ride home not included.
 <br>
 I never did have a thanksgiving dinner.
 <br>
 I can buy you a taco.
 <br>
 Oh, and then we can celebrate like the original thanksgiving with the pilgrims and the mexicans.
 <br>
 Welcome to the grand illusion come on in and see what&#39;s happening hey, check it out.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s rockin&#39; out to styx.
 <br>
 So? Fez was mouthing the words.
 <br>
 I I thought it was okay now because hyde was tapping his foot.
 <br>
 No, no, I was just squashing a bug.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;ve been kinda quiet.
 <br>
 Are you okay? I kissed the milkman! Happy thanksgiving, forman.
 <br>
 <br>
