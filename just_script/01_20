<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 I am so excited about Star Whores.
 <br>
 Fezzie, man, it&#39;s Star Wars.
 <br>
 Screw that.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman, man, this thing better be good.
 <br>
 If I don&#39;t see some space jugs, I&#39;m gonna be super-pissed.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, guys.
 <br>
 I hear it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no way it&#39;s better than The Planet of the Apes.
 <br>
 I mean, those apes were really good actors.
 <br>
 Whoa! Then they go into this bar and there are all these space creatures then, someone makes the mistake of picking on Obi-Wan Kenobi.
 <br>
 And then, he takes out his lightsaber and he goes &#34;whoosh&#34; and he chops this guy&#39;s arm right off, &#39;cause it&#39;s a saber that&#39;s made out of light.
 <br>
 You know, this doesn&#39;t sound like a nice movie.
 <br>
 Now, The Way We Were, that&#39;s a nice movie.
 <br>
 So, Eric, you gonna get yourself some Star Wars pajamas now? Kitty, I&#39;m going back to work, full-time.
 <br>
 My God, you&#39;re kidding.
 <br>
 No, I ran into Ron Milbank at the K-Mart and he&#39;s moved back to re-open the plant.
 <br>
 This is a godsend.
 <br>
 And to think how close we came to losing the house.
 <br>
 Losing the Mom, you said we were fine.
 <br>
 Eric, honey, I lied.
 <br>
 - Honey, this is the best news.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 - Hey, way to go, Daddy.
 <br>
 - My job and my little girl.
 <br>
 Okay, so, I&#39;m here, too, Dad.
 <br>
 Speaking of you I told Milbank&#39;s son David to come by to see you.
 <br>
 - David Milbank? Dad, I hated that guy.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I hate his dad but I smile like hell whenever I see him.
 <br>
 And you&#39;ll do the same.
 <br>
 Got it? Got it.
 <br>
 David Milbank? Oh, barf.
 <br>
 Eric, remember when you beat him up on the playground? Yep.
 <br>
 I kicked his ass.
 <br>
 Wait, wasn&#39;t he the kid with scoliosis and asthma? Yep.
 <br>
 And I kicked his ass.
 <br>
 So, Jackie, you want to go see Star Wars tonight? Michael, I told you, I don&#39;t like space.
 <br>
 Jackie, if we&#39;re gonna start our relationship over you gotta meet me halfway, honey.
 <br>
 Well, maybe I want to do something else tonight.
 <br>
 Like what? God, Jackie.
 <br>
 We can do that for the rest of our lives! Star Wars is a limited engagement.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But I want the big popcorn.
 <br>
 They finally left.
 <br>
 Now it&#39;s just the three of us.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great, Fez.
 <br>
 I get it.
 <br>
 If I was gone, you two would kiss.
 <br>
 Life&#39;s a bitch, huh? Eric! David&#39;s here.
 <br>
 The scoliosis asthma freak is here? I cannot wait to see this.
 <br>
 - Hey, guys.
 <br>
 I&#39;m back.
 <br>
 - Yeah, hey.
 <br>
 Wow, David.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve really grown up.
 <br>
 Me? Look at you.
 <br>
 You have really grown up.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 In fact, we&#39;ve all grown up.
 <br>
 Yes, but him much more than you have.
 <br>
 So, David, tell us about you.
 <br>
 We&#39;re dating.
 <br>
 What was that? What? I&#39;m just Sorry, making conversation here.
 <br>
 So, Donna, you still writing short stories? - Yeah, I still write a little.
 <br>
 - Not every You still write? - I mean, I would love to read your stuff.
 <br>
 - Yeah? Well, enough about us.
 <br>
 Tell us about you.
 <br>
 David, you still got that big old curve in your spine? Can I see it? Hi, Kelso.
 <br>
 Laurie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m bored.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re bored, you should go see Star Wars.
 <br>
 No, I was thinking of doing something else and Laurie, what&#39;s going on? You&#39;re acting like you&#39;re liking me and that&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like I told you, Kelso.
 <br>
 I&#39;m bored.
 <br>
 That&#39;s very flattering.
 <br>
 But you know, Jackie and I are back together.
 <br>
 I understand.
 <br>
 Do you want to see my appendix scar? Once again what&#39;s-her-name and I are back together.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s not my best story, but it&#39;s - Wow! I love it.
 <br>
 Do you have any more? Yeah, my God, yeah, I totally have more.
 <br>
 I just My God! My God, I am so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry about that.
 <br>
 What the hell&#39;s going on here? I spilled soda on him.
 <br>
 I should leave.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll see you later.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, great writing.
 <br>
 - What is it with you? - Me? Donna, he&#39;s hitting on you.
 <br>
 He is not.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just friends.
 <br>
 He talks to me, listens to me, shares ideas with me.
 <br>
 My God, Donna, you are so naive.
 <br>
 Eric, just because a guy pays attention to me does not mean he wants to get me naked.
 <br>
 Grow up! - Is that why you paid attention to me? - Of course! Not.
 <br>
 Of course not.
 <br>
 I love your mind.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the thing I love.
 <br>
 So, Donna says David and her are just good friends and if I don&#39;t believe that then she&#39;s gonna think that I don&#39;t trust her.
 <br>
 Eric, maybe you should let David have Donna.
 <br>
 I mean, they look so nice together.
 <br>
 You see, this is why your country lost the war.
 <br>
 My country never fought a war.
 <br>
 Yeah, big surprise.
 <br>
 You know, Forman, I&#39;m a romantic.
 <br>
 So I say you choke him till his eyes pop out.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hitting people is cool.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 If I hit this guy, Donna&#39;s just gonna be pissed.
 <br>
 No, man.
 <br>
 Chicks dig that stuff.
 <br>
 I mean, Leia, right, she acted like she was mad at Han but I could tell she liked him.
 <br>
 Kelso, man, what are you, an idiot? Leia likes Luke.
 <br>
 I mean, she kissed him on that bridge.
 <br>
 Just for luck! Guys, I have a real problem here.
 <br>
 I got it.
 <br>
 Maybe you should let David have Donna because, I mean, they look so nice together.
 <br>
 Now remember, a Jedi is his own master.
 <br>
 His own master.
 <br>
 His own master.
 <br>
 A Jedi&#39;s power lies within his own Are you even listening to me? What? Yes.
 <br>
 You were saying: &#34;May the force be with me.
 <br>
 &#34; No, I did not.
 <br>
 Jedi Knight.
 <br>
 Jedi dumbass.
 <br>
 Luke, man I don&#39;t mean to bum you out but I just saw Princess Leia cruise around with Darth Vader in his tie-fighter.
 <br>
 Right, Chewie? Man, this totally sucks! I should be Han.
 <br>
 Quit whining.
 <br>
 Will somebody get that? You know what? Why don&#39;t I just get it myself? Honey, it&#39;s Darth Vader.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 Oh, my God you guys just gotta come over to the dark side.
 <br>
 They have free food.
 <br>
 All right, what have you done with Princess Leia? Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Leia, what are you doing with Darth Vader? We&#39;re just friends, Luke.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;d really like him.
 <br>
 - No, I wouldn&#39;t! Give me a chance, Luke.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Hello? He&#39;s choking me with his mind, here.
 <br>
 That&#39;s, like, yeah, evil.
 <br>
 While Michael and I were apart, he realized how much he missed me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, Donna breaking up with him was the best thing I ever did.
 <br>
 I thought you said that getting a pedicure was the best thing you ever did.
 <br>
 That was last week, Donna.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do about Eric.
 <br>
 He&#39;s acting like this possessive, macho jerk.
 <br>
 I am so happy for you, Donna! No, Jackie, I&#39;m with him because I thought he wasn&#39;t like that.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, can you tell Donna I&#39;m right? Isn&#39;t it cool when men act like they own you? Yeah.
 <br>
 Mom, what about all those feminist classes you took? Right.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 - Hey, Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 - Hey, there, Eric.
 <br>
 Dad I was wondering if you could show me, like, a few fighting moves.
 <br>
 - Who are you planning to fight? - David Milbank.
 <br>
 David Milbank? He&#39;s got scoliosis and asthma.
 <br>
 You could take him.
 <br>
 Come on, now, Eric.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you beat up Kelso? I don&#39;t work for his dad.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s making a move on Donna.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s not going near that pretzel boy.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve got to nip this in the bud, Eric.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 The bridge of the nose is very vulnerable.
 <br>
 And hit him with a banjo.
 <br>
 A banjo, Bob? What? I&#39;m helping.
 <br>
 Where is he gonna get a banjo? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 But I saw a guy get hit with a banjo once, and he went down.
 <br>
 Hitting a guy with a banjo is dirty.
 <br>
 You wanna knee him in the groin.
 <br>
 You can hit him in the groin with a banjo.
 <br>
 So, what do you want to do tonight? And if you say, &#34;see Star Wars again,&#34; I&#39;m leaving.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t want to leave.
 <br>
 You want to see Star Wars.
 <br>
 Stop it! I have had it with you.
 <br>
 You are weird and I&#39;m going home! Jackie Boy, that&#39;s terrible the way she treats you.
 <br>
 Right? You know, I saw Star Wars and I&#39;m not a movie expert, but I think it&#39;s safe to say it was the greatest film of all time.
 <br>
 Finally someone who understands! Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, Kelso, I always thought you were kind of dumb.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t either.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Eric? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I think you do know, Red.
 <br>
 All right, Kitty.
 <br>
 Some kid&#39;s been hitting on Donna so he went to fight him.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 No big deal.
 <br>
 You men are such Neanderthals! Fighting over a woman.
 <br>
 It&#39;s ridiculous.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like that time at that beach when that lifeguard pinched my fanny.
 <br>
 You just had to lay him out, didn&#39;t you? Well, yeah.
 <br>
 How do you think I felt, Red? Watching you stand over that poor man your eyes burning with intensity your suntanned muscles gleaming like a bronzed god.
 <br>
 Okay, you and me, right now.
 <br>
 Eric, what are you doing? This isn&#39;t about you, Donna.
 <br>
 Eric, stop it.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Hold me back.
 <br>
 Stop it! Eric, for the last time David has no interest in me whatsoever! Yeah, I do.
 <br>
 What? Why do you think we&#39;ve been spending so much time together? - &#39;Cause we&#39;re friends? - Come on, Donna.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;ve talked to you I&#39;ve listened to you, I&#39;ve shared ideas with you.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that about? - I had the exact same problem with - What? I don&#39;t know what it takes with women.
 <br>
 I mean, you put in all this time and effort, and they wanna be just friends.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I hate that.
 <br>
 Man, and to think I was going to kick your ass.
 <br>
 You had every reason.
 <br>
 You hear that, Donna? &#34;Every reason.
 <br>
 &#34; You know what, Eric? You don&#39;t trust me and you don&#39;t respect me.
 <br>
 No, Donna, I was just trying to Get away from me! It wouldn&#39;t have worked out with her and me anyway.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m not supposed to say anything but we&#39;re just here until my dad closes down the plant.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Closes? Your dad was opening the plant full-time.
 <br>
 Yeah, they&#39;re burning off the inventory and then, that&#39;s all she wrote.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s depending on that job.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess he should have thought ahead like my dad.
 <br>
 You bastard! You broke my nose! Good! You&#39;ll pay for this, Forman! Before I leave, Donna will be mine! Dad.
 <br>
 - Hey, Dad, can I talk to you? - Absolutely.
 <br>
 Eric, I am very disappointed in you for fighting.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 See you in the car.
 <br>
 Where are you guys going? Taking your mother out for dinner and a movie.
 <br>
 A little celebration.
 <br>
 You know, son, sometimes life gives you a good bounce.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;d you want to talk about? Have a good time.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, little brother, I made out with Kelso.
 <br>
 Shut up! - What is wrong with you? - Everything&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s mad at me and the plant&#39;s closing, Dad&#39;s out of a job.
 <br>
 Oh, wow.
 <br>
 Guess this is a bad time to tell him I flunked out of college.
 <br>
 You know what, Laurie? I cannot believe that you&#39;re the favorite.
 <br>
 Yeah, doesn&#39;t it kick ass? That Vader&#39;s got him.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no way out of this.
 <br>
 Is this a true story? Yeah.
 <br>
 That voice.
 <br>
 James Earl Jones! Eric actually liked this? That kid&#39;s on dope.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 <br>
