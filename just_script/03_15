 [Grunts] - Oh! - Oh! That&#39;s 16 for me and Hyde and four for the losers! You guys ought to get a mascot- a big, green, furry loser! That&#39;s- That&#39;s not even a thing.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Take it to the hoop.
 <br>
 Or maybe you&#39;re afraid, &#39;cause you know I&#39;m gonna slap it down.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah? Well-Yeah? You tell her, Eric! Ooh! Oh! How can he stand the embarrassment? She told you what she was gonna do.
 <br>
 You gotta listen, man.
 <br>
 Eric, why don&#39;t you just give me the two points? Save yourself the humiliation.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t you just save yourself the two points, and then the humiliation will be- J-Whatever! Come on! Oh, I&#39;m comin&#39;, and there&#39;s nothin&#39; you can do to stop me.
 <br>
 Eric! Oh, my God! Donna&#39;s wearing granny panties! Nice panties, Granny! Oh, come on.
 <br>
 You have to admit, that was some killer &#34;D.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, no.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Okay, Fez, I got you some Valentine conversation hearts.
 <br>
 - [Giggles] - Oh, thank you, Caroline.
 <br>
 &#34;Be mine.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay.
 <br>
 &#34;Sweetheart.
 <br>
 &#34; It really is.
 <br>
 &#34;Kiss me.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, I&#39;m not about to argue with candy.
 <br>
 Fez, is there one in there that says, &#34;Get a room&#34;? No, but here&#39;s one that says, &#34;Kiss my brown ass.
 <br>
 &#34; Sorry you had to hear that, Caroline.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 She asked for it.
 <br>
 Ooh, I gotta get going.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll see you tonight.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Well, well, well.
 <br>
 Look who has a lady.
 <br>
 And to think, I was about to settle for you.
 <br>
 Talk about dodging a bullet.
 <br>
 Hey, hey.
 <br>
 Check out this article in Boys&#39;Life.
 <br>
 &#34;The Square Knot: NotJust For Squares&#34;? No, this one, about being an astronaut.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna do that.
 <br>
 Michael, I think there&#39;s a prerequisite for being an astronaut.
 <br>
 You have to be not dumb.
 <br>
 Uh-uh.
 <br>
 If they can send a monkey into space, they can send me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Monkeys are pretty smart.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Fine, fine.
 <br>
 Make fun.
 <br>
 But when you see my shoe prints on the moon, what are you gonna say then? Probably, &#34;Hey, some monkey&#39;s wearing Kelso&#39;s shoes!&#34; Hey, hey, astro-chimp.
 <br>
 When you come back down to Earth, if your parachute doesn&#39;t work you could always use Donna&#39;s monstrous panties.
 <br>
 Hey, hey, hey, you guys.
 <br>
 None of that when Donna gets here, okay? I don&#39;t need her mad at me on Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 All right, Forman, relax.
 <br>
 Wearing granny panties is a very sensitive issue that I don&#39;t find funny, and I refuse to exploit.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody, look.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Granny Panties! - Hyde! - Wha- Oh, sorry, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s in my nature to burn.
 <br>
 Granny Panties understands.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you, Granny Panties? Okay, look.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t have anything else to wear.
 <br>
 It was laundry day.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know they made a washing machine big enough for those panties.
 <br>
 Hey! Hey, you guys can all just shut up, okay? So she wears big panties.
 <br>
 So what? Donna, look, I am really, really, really sorry.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just forget about it.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause when I saw your sweats around your ankles, I thought I was dead.
 <br>
 - Eric, I said, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You are so cool.
 <br>
 - You- l-You are seriously, like, the coolest girl ever.
 <br>
 - Wow.
 <br>
 Chicks must really dig astronauts, &#39;cause it says here that astronauts get all the Tang they want.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna is gonna love you making dinner for her.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing sexier than a man who cooks.
 <br>
 Unless that man is Burt Reynolds.
 <br>
 Then I don&#39;t give a darn what he&#39;s doing.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just sexy! [Laughing] Ooh-hoo, Mom has a thing for the Bandit.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Ten-four.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Go set the table.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, honey, use the special china.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t want to mess up a good thing with everyday dishes.
 <br>
 Okay, but, Mom, it&#39;s not like I can mess this up.
 <br>
 I mean, Donna is cool no matter what I do.
 <br>
 Like, earlier, I pulled down her pants in front of everyone in the driveway - and she just stood there- - You did what? No, it was cool.
 <br>
 She just- She said she was fine.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Then I guess she&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 - Yeah, &#39;cause she said she was fine.
 <br>
 Yeah, she wouldn&#39;t say she was fine unless she was fine.
 <br>
 Would she? - What are you talking about? - What do you think I&#39;m talking about? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Why are you doing this to me? - Doing what? - I don&#39;t know! - Well, all I meant was, have a happy Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 [Doorbell Rings] Oh, okay.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Although I doubt you will.
 <br>
 Stop it! Hello, Michael.
 <br>
 Hi, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Is Laurie home? I got a little surprise for her.
 <br>
 Oh, you brought her flowers.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that just a waste of money.
 <br>
 No she deserves them.
 <br>
 I mean, not many people get me, you know? I&#39;m a complicated guy.
 <br>
 So when everyone starts in on me I just like to be with my girlfriend, &#39;cause she&#39;s nice to me.
 <br>
 - Who are we talking about? - Laurie.
 <br>
 - Laurie Forman? - Yeah, so I just want to tell her that I&#39;m happy we&#39;re together on this, our nation&#39;s day of love.
 <br>
 Oh, well, how patriotic of you, Michael.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Yeah.
 <br>
 I wanna be an astronaut.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, l- I think you&#39;d make a fine spaceman.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 You know, I gotta say, I think Laurie gets a lot of her sweetness from you.
 <br>
 Laurie Forman? Bye, Laurie.
 <br>
 Hey, man, what the hell are you doing? What? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I should, uh, probably go out through the window.
 <br>
 Oh, would you look at this? [Kiss] Ooh, a nice, romantic dinner for two.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s gonna love it.
 <br>
 Why, is she bringing a date? [Chuckles] - Red! - I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 - Hey, Mr.
 <br>
 And Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Oh, my.
 <br>
 Look at this vision of lovely.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Oh, this is just like when you two were little, and you-you used to eat pretend supper.
 <br>
 Only now it won&#39;t end up with Donna sitting on Eric&#39;s head.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Oh.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 - Kitty, that was just awful.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 Keep walking.
 <br>
 Wow, I was afraid that was gonna be awkward.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Eric, this looks so great.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Shaked, baked and maked especially for you.
 <br>
 And this here is a little somethin&#39; I like to call&#34;a little somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 &#34; You got me a present? That&#39;s so sweet.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t get you anything, and you got me panties? What the hell? Yeah, panties! - Get it? - No.
 <br>
 To replace your ugly ones.
 <br>
 Eric, when I said I didn&#39;t get it, I meant I didn&#39;t like it.
 <br>
 No, see, you forgave me earlier and I figured if I brought it up, we could just, you know, share a laugh.
 <br>
 [Chuckles Weakly] Your turn.
 <br>
 You know what? You&#39;re the one who doesn&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 - Well, maybe you should explain it to me.
 <br>
 - I heard that.
 <br>
 ! This is the worst Valentine&#39;s Day ever.
 <br>
 [Man Singing Blues Rock] It&#39;s Donna&#39;s fault.
 <br>
 Okay? I didn&#39;t make her wear that big, goofy underwear.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, but if you&#39;re hanging out with this crowd you gotta know that eventually your pants are gettin&#39; pulled down.
 <br>
 Am I right? I am so glad I did not pull down Caroline&#39;s pants.
 <br>
 I mean, if she asked me to, I would because I respect her wishes.
 <br>
 And, also, I am so horny.
 <br>
 Forman, when I told you it&#39;d be funny to give Donna panties I meant it&#39;d be funny to me.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] And it was.
 <br>
 This is what happened to my heart when I found out Laurie was cheating on me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s lemon.
 <br>
 I mean, how could she do this? [Stammers] I really thought we had somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 Probably the same way you did it toJackie.
 <br>
 Only this time it&#39;s even funnier, &#39;cause it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 This is a good day.
 <br>
 Tonight, I am going to ask Caroline to go steady with me because that is the last step before you can do it, right? Oh, how I want to do it.
 <br>
 I am so horny.
 <br>
 So Michael cheated on me with Laurie, and Laurie cheated on him.
 <br>
 Hmm! There is a God, and he&#39;s on my side.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 My boyfriend&#39;s a giant baby.
 <br>
 &#34;Ooh, underwear is so funny.
 <br>
 Poo-poo, pee-pee, caca.
 <br>
 &#34; You know what&#39;ll make you feel better? Let&#39;s go make mean jokes at Michael&#39;s expense.
 <br>
 How will that make me feel better? &#39;Cause then I&#39;ll feel better, and I can cheer you up.
 <br>
 On what planet did Eric think it was okay to pull down my pants? There are some things that are private, Jackie- for instance, everything under my pants.
 <br>
 I agree.
 <br>
 Keep it to yourself.
 <br>
 Why doesn&#39;t Eric understand that when I said, &#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I meant, I will be fine so long as he kisses my ass for two weeks until I&#39;m actually fine? He&#39;s, like, brain damaged.
 <br>
 Look, he&#39;s just not a good boyfriend.
 <br>
 You should dump him, and then we can move to Dallas and be weathergirls.
 <br>
 - So, how was your night? - He blew it.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] [Flatly] Well, what a surprise.
 <br>
 - Wait, you&#39;re saying that like it&#39;s not a surprise.
 <br>
 - Okay then.
 <br>
 You know, Son, there&#39;s a time and a place to pull down a lady&#39;s pants.
 <br>
 And a pickup game in our driveway is not one of&#39;em.
 <br>
 Look, Dad, I know it was dumb but Donna said it was fine, and apparently it wasn&#39;t fine.
 <br>
 Sit down.
 <br>
 Eric there&#39;s a pair of shoes up in your mom&#39;s closet.
 <br>
 And one day, I accidently stepped on one of them and scuffed it.
 <br>
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; your mom said.
 <br>
 &#34;Everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 &#34; But every now and then, she takes them out of the closet and she puts them on, and she does this.
 <br>
 [Mournfully] &#34;Ohh.
 <br>
 &#34; Then she takes them off and puts them back in her closet.
 <br>
 Eric, this has been going on for 14 years.
 <br>
 So why doesn&#39;t she just get new shoes? [Laughs] Oh, Eric you are so young.
 <br>
 You see, women are- What&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for here? Crazy.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 So, overall, you and Mom are okay.
 <br>
 So Donna and me, we&#39;ll be okay, right? No.
 <br>
 I scuffed your mom&#39;s shoe.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t pull her pants down in front of God and the foreign kid.
 <br>
 So, what are you saying? I&#39;m screwed with Donna? Hey, if it makes you feel any better I&#39;m surprised you lasted this long.
 <br>
 [Man Singing Ballad] [Continues] - I like popcorn.
 <br>
 Do you like popcorn? - Yes.
 <br>
 - I like candy.
 <br>
 Do you like candy? - [Giggles] Yes.
 <br>
 I like soda.
 <br>
 Would you like to go steady with me? - Oh, yes, Fez! - I think I might have tricked you.
 <br>
 You do know we are going steady, right? [Giggles] Yes! [Sighs] - What a magical night.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 I dreamed of this since the moment we met.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 - [Sighs] You know, this is my favorite movie of all time.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve seen it, like, 16 times.
 <br>
 That woman keeps calling Clint Eastwood and asking him to play &#34;Misty&#34; for her.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it romantic? Romantic? But she is following him and bothering him and threatening him.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s what I mean.
 <br>
 If she can&#39;t have him, nobody can.
 <br>
 Okay then.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re so cute.
 <br>
 I love being your girlfriend.
 <br>
 - If you ever left me, I&#39;d kill you.
 <br>
 - [Laughing] [Quavering] O- Okay then.
 <br>
 What&#39;s up with Eric&#39;s head anyway? It&#39;s completely out of proportion to that skinny body.
 <br>
 He looks like a Blow Pop.
 <br>
 You know, I bet Michael&#39;s gonna want me to feel sorry for him.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m gonna be all, like &#34;Aww.
 <br>
 Bite it, Casanova!&#34; [Knocking] - Hey, Jackie, Donna.
 <br>
 - Hey, Michael.
 <br>
 I heard what happened.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Me and Laurie are done.
 <br>
 - Doesn&#39;t Eric look like a Blow Pop? - Uh, yeah, I guess.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Uh, listen, uh, Jackie, can we go somewhere and talk? No! Look, anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Donna.
 <br>
 Well, okay.
 <br>
 Uh, listen what happened with me and Laurie got me thinking.
 <br>
 And what she did was really a betrayal and it hurt so much.
 <br>
 So you want me to feel sorry for you.
 <br>
 - No, don&#39;t feel sorry for me.
 <br>
 - Wait, what? No, I deserve this.
 <br>
 After what I did to you? I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve made the connection, but there are a lot of similarities between what Laurie did to me and what I did to you.
 <br>
 Except you and I were really in love and you trusted me.
 <br>
 Jackie, I let you down, and I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Are you just saying this stuff so I&#39;ll give you Valentine sex? &#39;Cause this is a holy day, Michael and you should be ashamed of yourself.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I just said what I wanted to say, and I don&#39;t blame you if you never want to speak to me again.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Good-bye.
 <br>
 [Door OPens] [Door Closes] Jackie, are you okay? Sure.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just sitting here alone on Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 - Hey, I&#39;m here.
 <br>
 - Yeah, why are you here? You should be with the one you love.
 <br>
 And you love Eric for some reason.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a lot of reasons.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not a Blow Pop.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a sweetie pie.
 <br>
 Then you should be with him.
 <br>
 Look, take it from someone who has loved and lost.
 <br>
 Whatever he did isn&#39;t worth being alone on this holiest of days.
 <br>
 Jackie, are you actually thinking about me instead of yourself? Yeah! God, I&#39;ve had way too much sugar! Look, Eric, we need to talk.
 <br>
 Before, I told you everything was fine when it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;m sorry for not letting you know what a colossally insensitive bonehead you are.
 <br>
 Oh, apology accepted.
 <br>
 That&#39;s very big of you.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 So from now on when you piss me off I will do you the courtesy of blowing up in your face.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, that&#39;s all I ask.
 <br>
 And as for my part, I&#39;ve realized that somewhere along the way we crossed a line where pulling down your pants in public is really no longer that funny.
 <br>
 And I suppose that point came when - you started letting me pull them down in private.
 <br>
 - Exactly.
 <br>
 So are we good? Yeah.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] No.
 <br>
 - Are we good now? - Gettin&#39; there.
 <br>
 - Just- Come on.
 <br>
 Let me put my pants on.
 <br>
 - Nope.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s really cold.
 <br>
 And- You know, I&#39;m freezing off parts of my body that I know you&#39;ve expressed appreciation for.
 <br>
 Eric, for God&#39;s sakes, no one wants to see that.
 <br>
 Yeah, now we&#39;re good.
 <br>
 [Mournfully] Ohh.
 <br>
 - Something wrong, honey? - No.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 <br>
