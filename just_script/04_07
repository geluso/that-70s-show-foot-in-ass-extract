<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s making a cheese sandwich, but he&#39;s missing some stuff.
 <br>
 So, can I borrow bread and cheese? Oh, your dad&#39;s having a hard time without your mom, isn&#39;t he? Midge was the brains of that outfit? ( Laughs ) Oh, I&#39;m- I&#39;m sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 - Sorry about what? - You, get Donna bread and cheese.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 This is a really nice dress.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it fancy? ( Laughs ) It&#39;s for the Price Mart Ball tomorrow night.
 <br>
 Oh, right, the Price Mart Ball.
 <br>
 So who you takin&#39;? Who&#39;s the lucky lady? Oh, well, I decided not to go.
 <br>
 Personal choice.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have a date, do you? Okay.
 <br>
 You know what? It&#39;s not about, &#39;&#39;Can I get a date?&#39;&#39; It&#39;s about this great book that I&#39;m, like, halfway through.
 <br>
 Plus, you know, I could get a date.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) - I&#39;ve got numbers, buddy.
 <br>
 Sure you do, honey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re number one with me.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going tomorrow night.
 <br>
 And you&#39;d better not go stag, Eric.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing worse than an 80-pound boy dancing with his mommy all night.
 <br>
 You know what? ( Clears Throat ) I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 I told you I would, like, months ago.
 <br>
 But that was before the ugliness.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m- I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 Plus, I mean, last year they had all-you-can-eat shrimp.
 <br>
 Well, I mean, you know, I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m over it.
 <br>
 I was just worried that you might think it was weird, us going out on a date.
 <br>
 So, I mean, you know, the concern laid with you.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s not a date.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not- I know.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s not a date.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a date.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a shrimp fest.
 <br>
 A festival of shrimp, if you will.
 <br>
 - Exactly.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll see you tomorrow night.
 <br>
 - &#39;Kay.
 <br>
 - ( Door Closes ) - See, now, look.
 <br>
 My little prince is going to the ball.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! - ( Stereo:Rock ) - So, Forman, you break up with Donna but you still get to have sex and go on dates with her? Ride the big red wave, dude.
 <br>
 I should break up with Donna.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Donna, we are through.
 <br>
 Let the sex and dating begin.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a date.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just friends now, because she&#39;s over it.
 <br>
 - Well, guess who else is over it? - I am.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 - So over it.
 <br>
 Look, man, breaking up sucks, okay? When Jackie dumped me, you know what she said? &#39;&#39;Somethin&#39; somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 Never wanna see you again.
 <br>
 Blah, blah, blah.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Hey, you think that didn&#39;t hurt? Okay.
 <br>
 You know what? - I&#39;m done talking about this.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 But I will say this.
 <br>
 If she doesn&#39;t want it to be a date, then it won&#39;t be a date.
 <br>
 I am so cool with that, because as we all know I am very mature.
 <br>
 Now, if you would all please excuse me my mommy has to iron my corduroys.
 <br>
 Ah, women.
 <br>
 Am I right, guys? Ah, who am I kidding? There&#39;s no woman for Fez.
 <br>
 What must Fez do to get a woman? Well, for one thing, he&#39;s gotta cut out that third-person crap.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 You are Fez.
 <br>
 You know somethin&#39; else? Shoes say a lot about a man.
 <br>
 In your case, your chukka boots are screaming &#39;&#39;virgin.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Damn you, boots.
 <br>
 What else have you told them? Hey, Fez seeing you wear those chukkas makes me wanna up-chukka.
 <br>
 - Nice.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like I ate too many &#39;&#39;chukkalate&#39;&#39; chip cookies.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, how much wood could a &#39;&#39;woodchukka&#39;&#39; chukka- Hey.
 <br>
 Shut the chukka up.
 <br>
 How am I supposed to afford new boots? My Bible-thumping host parents won&#39;t give me an allowance because I am a pagan.
 <br>
 You know, Leo&#39;s looking for help down at the Fotohut.
 <br>
 The Fotohut, huh? I can really &#39;&#39;picture&#39;&#39; myself there.
 <br>
 That job and I will really &#39;&#39;click.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, I am on a &#39;&#39;roll&#39;&#39; of film.
 <br>
 Ow.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be so &#39;&#39;negative.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I am the king.
 <br>
 You sure you wanna get in the Fotohut game? It can chew you up and spit you out like a stick of gum.
 <br>
 Or something that seemed edible till you put it in your mouth and then you realized it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 Or a stick of gum.
 <br>
 - What kind of gum? - Big Red.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re hired.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re on probation.
 <br>
 No, wait.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on probation.
 <br>
 Oh, wow.
 <br>
 I gotta go see my probation officer.
 <br>
 - So he&#39;s my new boss? - Welcome to paradise.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Oh, Red.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t the kids look nice for their date? Yeah.
 <br>
 Nice as hell.
 <br>
 - Oh, well, thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Actually, Mom as Donna so thoughtfully pointed out earlier, this isn&#39;t a date.
 <br>
 Well, I just- I like seeing you together.
 <br>
 You just-You look so natural.
 <br>
 But we&#39;re not together.
 <br>
 Well, sure you are.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking right at you.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s spend the night in the driveway looking at the kids.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I wanna do.
 <br>
 Oh, hang on one sec.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Donna? Why don&#39;t you make like a circle and go round, okay? That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Like a circle.
 <br>
 Slide over or I&#39;ll hit you in the head.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 - ( Singsong Voice ) You got yelled at .
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 ( Disco ) Oh, okay, this is us.
 <br>
 See? This is great.
 <br>
 Being out together, not on a date,just friends.
 <br>
 I feel, like, virtually nothing for you.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s have a seat.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 Oh, whoops.
 <br>
 Not a date.
 <br>
 - Eric! - I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Okay, uh, minor glitch.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s let the good times roll.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Isn&#39;t this nice? Okay, Kitty.
 <br>
 Enough jawin&#39;.
 <br>
 Drinks are only free for the first two hours.
 <br>
 Oh, do you think they have peach schnapps? Peach is my favorite schnapp.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Lyle, Housewares manager in Oshkosh.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Eric, stock boy, Point Place.
 <br>
 And this is my friend Donna.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not on a date, even though, I mean- even though I did pay for her.
 <br>
 But what can you do? Tell me, Lyle.
 <br>
 Are you here on a real date? Uh- Hey, that&#39;s Stewie.
 <br>
 Stewie.
 <br>
 Nice going.
 <br>
 Scared off Lyle.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;ll never meet Stewie.
 <br>
 Eric, what is wrong with you? Hey, guy.
 <br>
 Put your arm around your date.
 <br>
 - Oh, no, she&#39;s not my date- - Oh,just shut up and take the picture.
 <br>
 Ta-da! Quittin&#39; time, chief? No.
 <br>
 I devised a system to streamline our operations.
 <br>
 From now on, all orders will be filed alphabetically.
 <br>
 So the size of a customer&#39;s boobs? No longer a factor.
 <br>
 You see, it saves time.
 <br>
 And time, my friend, is money.
 <br>
 But money is not time.
 <br>
 You&#39;d think it would go both ways, but it doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 ( Disco ) Hey, Moby Dick called.
 <br>
 He wants his shrimp back.
 <br>
 It&#39;s those hilarious jokes that I miss so much since we broke up.
 <br>
 So, uh should I get us some punch or- Wait.
 <br>
 Do you get the punch? Oh, no.
 <br>
 How do we get the punch? Eric, stop it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re being an ass.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t you just, you know, get over it? I only said that because I wanna be friends again.
 <br>
 I mean, I wish we could pretend that we were never boyfriend and girlfriend and just, you know, be friends.
 <br>
 Donna, it&#39;s hard.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like being friends with Hyde, okay? I haven&#39;t, you know touched his fun parts- well, on purpose.
 <br>
 - We used to have a lot fun together.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Just like there used to be shrimp in the world.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m gonna go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 When I get back, we&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun together.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Hi, I&#39;m Connie.
 <br>
 Pet Supplies, Sheboygan.
 <br>
 You, uh, wanna dance? Oh, uh- Yeah, I&#39;m kind of here with someone so- Okay.
 <br>
 Well, um, maybe I&#39;ll see you around.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 - What the hell is wrong with you? - Okay, you hurt my arm.
 <br>
 She was a real looker.
 <br>
 And for some reason she talked to you.
 <br>
 - Now go get her.
 <br>
 - What? No.
 <br>
 Dad, Donna&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Well, Donna&#39;s off having fun while you&#39;re sittin&#39; here being a big lump.
 <br>
 Okay, first of all you are way too involved with my life, okay? And second of all, Donna&#39;s not having fun.
 <br>
 She&#39;s in the bathroom.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not the bathroom.
 <br>
 Now, go talk to that girl before she comes to her senses and wants nothing to do with you.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Your mother&#39;s doing shots with Gladys from Housewares.
 <br>
 Kitty, put it down.
 <br>
 My wife left me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t cook.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t shop.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hungry.
 <br>
 This place scares me, and I like Salisbury steak.
 <br>
 So you don&#39;t cook or shop, and your idea of a nice meal is gristly hamburger smothered in goo? What woman could let all that go? Hey, I&#39;ve got an upside.
 <br>
 Th-There are things.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a good guy- a good, old-fashioned, out-of-touch, Stone Age guy.
 <br>
 But, you know, there&#39;s nothing wrong with you that changing yourself completely couldn&#39;t fix.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) Here.
 <br>
 In the meantime, have a pretzel.
 <br>
 - I can tell you haven&#39;t eaten anything.
 <br>
 - I am pretty hungry.
 <br>
 Oh, never shop when you&#39;re hungry &#39;cause you&#39;ll end up at home with 1 5 Salisbury steaks.
 <br>
 Give me those.
 <br>
 See, the problem is I have a daughter at home.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna have to start feeding her.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I can do this.
 <br>
 Of course you can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Lucky for you, I&#39;m here.
 <br>
 Now we just gotta find everything you need to make a meat loaf.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna make me a meat loaf? No.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna make me a meat loaf.
 <br>
 Okay, but sometimes I burn myself on the oven.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m, uh- I&#39;m Bob.
 <br>
 -Joanne.
 <br>
 Now haul ass, Bob.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 - Oop.
 <br>
 Oh, sorry.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna.
 <br>
 Oh, oh.
 <br>
 So, are you having fun at the big ball? Um, yeah.
 <br>
 You know, at first I wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Eric was being really jerky and weird.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Well, he does that.
 <br>
 If he gets me a glass of punch, it&#39;s not like we have to sleep together.
 <br>
 Well, it would have to be pretty good punch.
 <br>
 They have an open bar.
 <br>
 Uh! I just wish Eric could relax.
 <br>
 Well, um, I think he can.
 <br>
 ( Donna ) Oh.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Oh, good for him.
 <br>
 I&#39;m- I&#39;m glad.
 <br>
 He&#39;s dancing with a beautiful skank! Well, I will say this about Price Mart: They have wonderful balls.
 <br>
 Red, grab that centerpiece.
 <br>
 Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s another.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Donna, honey, grab that centerpiece.
 <br>
 Kitty, how many centerpieces do we need? Red, they are center pieces.
 <br>
 ! - Okay, so don&#39;t lose my number, all right? - All right.
 <br>
 Eric, what the hell? - What? - Why are you kissing her? - You&#39;re on a date with me.
 <br>
 - It wasn&#39;t a date.
 <br>
 Well, it is now, you bastard! Now come open my car door for me before I kick your ass! The Fotohut&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Hyde, your job kicks ass.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I never thought I&#39;d be a workingman, man.
 <br>
 But, man, here I am working for the man.
 <br>
 And you know what, man? I like the man.
 <br>
 Hey, thanks, man.
 <br>
 So, my probation officer was sure happy I came by.
 <br>
 He even wants to see me for some additional years.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a good guy.
 <br>
 Ugly, fat, whorey, old whorey, old, four-eyes, ugly, fat.
 <br>
 Oh, this one&#39;s kinda cute.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) I mean, for a fatty.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) I mean, for a whore? ( Groans ) Damn,Jackie! What do you want me to say? That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I cannot work like this.
 <br>
 Anyone who doesn&#39;t have to be here must leave.
 <br>
 - ( Scoffs ) Fez- - I said, leave.
 <br>
 ( Hits Ground ) Damn, Fez.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve only been here one day and you&#39;re already trying to change everything.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we crossed into some different dimension where we&#39;re in some kind of Fotohut.
 <br>
 It&#39;s eerie, man.
 <br>
 And then you encourage him and what happens? He ends up kissing a girl while he&#39;s on a date with another girl.
 <br>
 Once again, an open bar spells disaster for the Forman family.
 <br>
 Red, I am not drunk.
 <br>
 I am upset and drunk.
 <br>
 All I know is that is not the way to behave on a date.
 <br>
 ( Together) It wasn&#39;t a date.
 <br>
 ( Together) Oh, please.
 <br>
 Good morning.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 It was morning when I got here, on time.
 <br>
 Now, put this on.
 <br>
 Clever, huh? Yes, very.
 <br>
 Fez- ( Clears Throat ) Working here is about goofing off- you know, creating a model of inefficiency.
 <br>
 You&#39;re ruining the Fotohut, man.
 <br>
 And if you think I&#39;m gonna stand idly by you&#39;re right, &#39;cause that&#39;s what I do here.
 <br>
 Oh, Hyde, you&#39;re here early.
 <br>
 Oh, slick uniform, man.
 <br>
 Is that how you spell Fotohut? Yes, but Hyde won&#39;t wear it.
 <br>
 - Something&#39;s gotta change around here, man.
 <br>
 - Amen.
 <br>
 - ( Door Closes ) - I don&#39;t like what&#39;s goin&#39; on here, man.
 <br>
 That little dude&#39;s making us all look bad.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m afraid the boss is gonna fire me.
 <br>
 - Leo, you are the boss.
 <br>
 Did you fire him yet? I&#39;ll take his shifts.
 <br>
 Hey, dude, man.
 <br>
 I think we decided that you&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a cold slap in the groin.
 <br>
 How am I supposed to afford my new boots? Here.
 <br>
 Just do what I do, man.
 <br>
 Just get some money out of the register when the boss isn&#39;t lookin&#39;.
 <br>
 Once again, Leo, you are the boss.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not lookin&#39;.
 <br>
 ( Register Dings ) - Hey, kissy-face.
 <br>
 - Ah, well.
 <br>
 If it isn&#39;t Kooky McShrimplover, who doesn&#39;t know how she feels.
 <br>
 Comin&#39; over here like everything&#39;s normal and nothin&#39; happened last night.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my Kooky McShrimplover.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I freaked out.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a first.
 <br>
 Well, this is complicated, okay? I mean, we do wanna be friends, right? Yeah.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna be nothing.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, then, maybe some rules will help.
 <br>
 Like, when we&#39;re out on a date that&#39;s not a date - we can&#39;t make out with slutty girls.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Or that could just be a rule for me.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, Donna, feel free- No.
 <br>
 Feel encouraged to make out with all the slutty girls you want.
 <br>
 What is this? Is this- ( Kisses ) kissy girl&#39;s phone number? Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Okay, see ya.
 <br>
 ( Groaning ) I got it.
 <br>
 Her phone number is 729-36.
 <br>
 I think there are a couple more numbers than that.
 <br>
 Really? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s 729-36- ampersand? Maybe, but I just don&#39;t really know how to dial that.
 <br>
 Just- Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be hard.
 <br>
 <br>
