<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Here you go, Red: Belgian waffles.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s Belgian about &#39;em? - They crumble at the hands of the Nazis.
 <br>
 This bacon is so amazing.
 <br>
 Makes me regret calling girls pigs all my life.
 <br>
 Why is the loud one eating my breakfast? Well, her father&#39;s in prison and her mother&#39;s in Mexico.
 <br>
 See, this is what I don&#39;t get about your dad.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re arrested for bribery, can&#39;t you just bribe your way out? I mean, you&#39;re a briber.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what you do.
 <br>
 My dad is broke.
 <br>
 I mean, in fact, the bank foreclosed on our ski cabin.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s gotta be moved out this weekend and it&#39;s all up to me.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m just so very small.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;d like to help, but not as much as I&#39;d like not to.
 <br>
 Too late.
 <br>
 Already packed an overnight bag.
 <br>
 Kitty, why is it we always do what you wanna do and never do what I wanna do? It&#39;s in the Bible.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Well, have a fun weekend, Pops.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re coming too, pal.
 <br>
 And there&#39;s gonna be heavy lifting.
 <br>
 You better bring Donna.
 <br>
 Jackie, why can&#39;t Hyde help? Oh, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 He&#39;s your boyfriend.
 <br>
 I guess that&#39;s punishment enough.
 <br>
 Now, I&#39;ve been with Steven long enough to know the best way to keep our relationship going smoothly is by never asking him to do stuff.
 <br>
 So instead I told him I&#39;d be out of town this weekend for a big doll expo.
 <br>
 Oh, there&#39;s a doll expo? Man, I&#39;ve been lookin&#39; for Jungle-fightin&#39; G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got vine grip and poisoned darts.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Poison not included.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Chuckles ) I left mine out in the rain.
 <br>
 He got jungle rot.
 <br>
 I- I had to amputate his foot.
 <br>
 - Okay, so you got plans this weekend? - Yes, I do.
 <br>
 - No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 - No, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 All right, good, &#39;causeJackie&#39;s at a doll expo so I&#39;m thinkin&#39; you, me, Kelso sneak up to her cabin drink beer till we all look pretty.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Let me get rid of this customer.
 <br>
 Next! - Read the top letter, please.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s an &#39;&#39;E.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; No! Fail.
 <br>
 Move along.
 <br>
 Wh-What are you talkin&#39; about, man? That&#39;s an &#39;&#39;E.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;Kay, I&#39;ll give you one more chance.
 <br>
 Read the top letter, please.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;E.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - No! Double fail! Double fail? You made that up.
 <br>
 This, my blind friend, is a capital &#39;&#39;E.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; The double fail stands.
 <br>
 Hey, wait a second.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t you the guy that got caught in the school shower with the lotion and the Playboy? Pass, pass.
 <br>
 Double pass.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - Now, stay with me.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be right on your bumper.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t tailgate.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll keep a safe distance.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t lollygag.
 <br>
 - What do I even say? -Just smile and nod.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t smile and nod.
 <br>
 You look like an idiot.
 <br>
 - You know, I&#39;m kind of excited about this road trip.
 <br>
 - ( Van Door Opens ) We&#39;ve been talkin&#39; about fooling around in some place new and different- - ( Engine Starts ) -you and me alone in a car on a country road after dark? Yeah.
 <br>
 And hey, if I don&#39;t get lucky with you, we&#39;re bound to run into a farmer&#39;s daughter.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 This is great: no broads, just us guys.
 <br>
 We can really get to know each other.
 <br>
 Fez, you try and lure me in the hot tub, and I&#39;m kickin&#39; your ass.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just saying, we&#39;re all so tense.
 <br>
 Well, we won&#39;t be for long.
 <br>
 Last time I was here, I hid a stash.
 <br>
 Just gotta remember where I put it.
 <br>
 I know it was someplace I could fit my hand.
 <br>
 - Well, that rules out your face.
 <br>
 - What? Ow! Am I distracting you, my big, strong driver man? Not at all, my lonely hitchhiker.
 <br>
 Well, how did you get your foot all the way over here? You can thank my dad for the ballet lessons.
 <br>
 I will be sure to send him a fruit basket.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 Donna, when did that U-Haul we&#39;ve been following turn into an ice cream truck? - Oh- Oh, man.
 <br>
 We lost Red.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Wait, we can&#39;t be that far off-trail.
 <br>
 - ( Paper Rustling ) - Let&#39;s look atJackie&#39;s directions.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;I-43 to Highway 60.
 <br>
 Head east when it gets different.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - &#39;&#39;When it gets different.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; What the hell does that mean? - Wait.
 <br>
 Let me see that.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Go a ways past the fancy thing and turn left at the ugly house.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh.
 <br>
 Well, if the &#39;&#39;fancy thing&#39;s&#39;&#39; a dead cow, then we&#39;re almost there.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, did you find the stash yet? No, there&#39;s nothin&#39; in the kitchen I can fit my hand in you know, except for the garbage disposal.
 <br>
 ( Screams ) ( Laughs ) Well, I&#39;m going to the corner to buy some beer.
 <br>
 Do not get in the hot tub without me.
 <br>
 - ( Door Opens ) - Man, it&#39;s like- - ( Door Closes ) - that stash is probably starin&#39; me right in the face.
 <br>
 Oh! Ha! Yeah.
 <br>
 It wasn&#39;t someplace I could fit my hand.
 <br>
 - It was someplace that could eat my hand.
 <br>
 - ( Vehicle Approaching ) - Hey.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a truck pullin&#39; up to the cabin.
 <br>
 - ( Brakes Squeak ) - Oh, it&#39;s Red! - Is it a fire truck? The truck&#39;s not red.
 <br>
 The guy is Red, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Red Forman.
 <br>
 - Not it.
 <br>
 - ( Vehicle Doors Closing ) What? No, I said, &#39;&#39;Not it.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; If playground rules aren&#39;t in effect, this is anarchy.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s directions say, &#39;&#39;Pass the place I bought a green sweater.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t stop.
 <br>
 The cotton has polyester in it.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; This is great.
 <br>
 We&#39;re lost.
 <br>
 No, we&#39;re not lost.
 <br>
 We just need to find our bearings.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Where would she go around here to find a green sweater? Why, the green sweater store, Donna.
 <br>
 Good thinking.
 <br>
 Hey, why are you mad at me? I- Because you need to learn to control your urges.
 <br>
 If you&#39;d have kept your big foot outta my bean bags, we wouldn&#39;t be in this mess.
 <br>
 Well, excuse me for reading Cosmo and trying a little somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 If you think you&#39;re gettin&#39; the topless nachos now, you&#39;re crazy.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Ah, man, now I&#39;m hungry.
 <br>
 I want my Twinkie.
 <br>
 - You packed Twinkies? - I packed a Twinkie.
 <br>
 There&#39;s only one left, and it&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 Whoever packed it, snacked it.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve been lookin&#39; forward to it all day.
 <br>
 - Oh, you have? That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 That&#39;s- That&#39;s very ladylike.
 <br>
 - ( Gibberish ) - Eh.
 <br>
 Jackie and the Formans are here.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re not supposed to be here.
 <br>
 And this is illegal.
 <br>
 We&#39;re busted.
 <br>
 No, you&#39;re busted.
 <br>
 I&#39;m out the bathroom window.
 <br>
 What? Get off of me.
 <br>
 ( Voice Cracking ) Welcome to the cabin.
 <br>
 - What are you doin&#39; here? - Yes! Well, you scared me.
 <br>
 I thought you were a robber.
 <br>
 Now I really need to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Yeah, there was no window in there.
 <br>
 Steven, what are you doing here? Why don&#39;t you tell me? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You heard about the foreclosure and you knew I lied about the doll expo, so you came up here to help me move my stuff.
 <br>
 That&#39;s exactly what I did.
 <br>
 And you found me out.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, I completely misjudged you.
 <br>
 I mean, somehow you&#39;ve become the boyfriend I always hoped you could be.
 <br>
 And shame on you for doubting me.
 <br>
 Hey, I got beer and Pixy Stix.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s party.
 <br>
 Hey, we said no broads.
 <br>
 Why do you need alcohol? Is that beer really gonna make your lives better? - Not if you don&#39;t let us drink it.
 <br>
 - ( Red ) Shut it.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s clear this place out.
 <br>
 If we hurry, I don&#39;t have to sleep here.
 <br>
 I hate nature.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Steven, you know what? I thought you finally understood what being a couple was about.
 <br>
 Well, what is being a couple? It&#39;s all about give-and-take, yin and yang.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a philosophical paradox like a tree falling in the forest with no one around to hear it.
 <br>
 Does it make a noise? Who&#39;s to say? Okay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just confusing me.
 <br>
 You see? It&#39;s murky.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I&#39;m up against.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 What a load of crap! Who&#39;s to say what crap is? - ( Chuckles ) - Here.
 <br>
 Pull my vase.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I know this one.
 <br>
 No, thank you.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Man, it&#39;s stuck.
 <br>
 I put the stash in here, and now I can&#39;t get my hand out.
 <br>
 Oh, I can help.
 <br>
 ( Clicks Tongue ) Oh, damn.
 <br>
 I guess I left my Baby Oil in the other pants.
 <br>
 - ( Straining ) - This vase smells like chocolate.
 <br>
 Really? Aah! ( Fez Chuckling ) You can&#39;t see it, but I&#39;m flippin&#39; you off right now.
 <br>
 - ( Strains ) - What&#39;s goin&#39; on? Oh,just a classic case of hand stuck in vase.
 <br>
 Well, get it off, or you&#39;ll have a classic case of foot stuck in ass.
 <br>
 - ( Groans ) - Hey, what&#39;s the teeny writing on the bottom of the vase say? - What teeny writing? Aah! - ( Both Giggling ) Stop doing that! Get smarter! ( Objects Clattering ) Steven, would you be careful? That&#39;s my trophy for Prettiest Ballerina.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Oh, but that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t care about stuff that&#39;s important to me.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what? You&#39;re the one who lied and said you were going to a doll expo.
 <br>
 - Should&#39;ve just told me what&#39;s goin&#39; on with you.
 <br>
 - I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you.
 <br>
 Okay? You should just know.
 <br>
 - So- - ( Kicks Box ) I&#39;m just supposed to magically know that &#39;&#39;I&#39;m going to a doll expo&#39;&#39; is Jackiespeak for, uh, &#39;&#39;My parents&#39; cabin is being foreclosed on.
 <br>
 I need help cleaning it out&#39;&#39;? Yes.
 <br>
 Steven, my family is falling apart, and you&#39;ve never, ever even asked about it.
 <br>
 If you cared, you&#39;d figure out what was goin&#39; on with me and find a way to help.
 <br>
 Jackie, that&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 The only time people I know find a way to help is when they&#39;re cuttin&#39; a deal with the D.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) - ( Clatters ) - Whatever happens, you&#39;re drivin&#39; her back.
 <br>
 She talked so much on the way here I thought I was gonna have to strap her to the hood of the van like a deer.
 <br>
 Boy,Jackie looks mad.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I cheated on her, like, a hundred times, and she never looked that pissed.
 <br>
 Come on, Kelso.
 <br>
 Grab that end of the couch.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve had it with that vase.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gettin&#39; a hammer.
 <br>
 Oh, come on.
 <br>
 What the- Why won&#39;t this thing come off? ( Strains ) Like, my hand wouldn&#39;t be so big if I didn&#39;t have to hold this stupid bag.
 <br>
 You&#39;re holding the bag? Just- ( Sputters ) let go, you moron! Fine.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like the world&#39;s greatest pinata.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) What the hell happened here? Steven what&#39;s in the bag? The Packers winnin&#39; next year&#39;s Super Bowl- That&#39;s what&#39;s in the bag.
 <br>
 Is that what I think it is? If you mean paprika, yes, sir! Honey- Honey, paprika is red.
 <br>
 If you mean green paprika, yes, sir! Green paprika? Hyde, what am I lookin&#39; for here? ( Sternly ) Oregano.
 <br>
 If you mean oregano, yes, sir! ( No Audible Dialogue ) Did Jackie say anything about Davis Street? Not unless it&#39;s &#39;&#39;the street where I dropped my gum that time.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 We&#39;re goin&#39; home.
 <br>
 - ( Exhales ) - And, Donna, I&#39;m sorry about what I said about your urges.
 <br>
 I love your urges.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve been very good to me.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 They do what they can.
 <br>
 Um, I&#39;m waiting for my apology.
 <br>
 - For what? - For that Twinkie you inhaled? Are you serious? ( Scoffs ) Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry I ate your Twinkie.
 <br>
 You rolled your eyes.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t count if you roll your eyes.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry I ate your Twinkie.
 <br>
 - Wh-You rolled your eyes again! - It was just a stupid Twinkie! - It was my Twinkie, Donna.
 <br>
 ( Quietly ) It was my Twinkie.
 <br>
 Do you idiots realize how much trouble you&#39;re in? How can that bathroom not have a window? Wh-What&#39;s goin&#39; on? Well, apparently Hyde had a stash that none of us knew anything about.
 <br>
 Especially me- ( Chuckles ) though I think Fez knew too.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the way you want it? Fine.
 <br>
 You have to sleep sometime.
 <br>
 Okay, shut it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m calling your parents.
 <br>
 I&#39;m calling Immigration.
 <br>
 And you- I warned you once about this crap.
 <br>
 Now I have no choice.
 <br>
 You&#39;re outta the house.
 <br>
 - No, wait.
 <br>
 Look, that stash wasn&#39;t his.
 <br>
 It was mine.
 <br>
 -Jackie- - Let me talk.
 <br>
 - Yeah, Hyde.
 <br>
 Let her talk.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Look, it&#39;s just- I&#39;ve been having such a hard time since my dad&#39;s been in jail that I was looking for anything that just might make me feel better.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, it&#39;s like you with your menopause and all that wine you&#39;re always drinkin&#39;.
 <br>
 ( Kelso ) No.
 <br>
 Well, you shut your dirty, little mouth.
 <br>
 Now, Steven, you tell me the truth right now.
 <br>
 Is this yours or not? Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, I&#39;m telling you the truth.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not mine.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t care whose it is.
 <br>
 I&#39;m throwin&#39; it in the lake.
 <br>
 What? I paid 20 bucks for that.
 <br>
 You got my parents&#39; number.
 <br>
 That&#39;ll teach you to sell me out, you son of a bitch! All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 So, I snuck up here behind your back we have a huge fight, and then you do something nice for me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like when the Grinch stole Christmas, but all the little Whos sang anyway.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just what people do for the people they care about.
 <br>
 - Nobody I ever knew.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s &#39;cause you were poor, and poor people are bad.
 <br>
 But, look, it&#39;s like what I was talkin&#39; about before.
 <br>
 I sensed you were in trouble, and I look for a way to help you without you having to ask me.
 <br>
 Jackie, to be fair, you heard Red say, &#39;&#39;Hyde, you&#39;re out of the house&#39;&#39; not &#39;&#39;Hyde, you&#39;re going to a doll expo.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - Well, anyway, thank you.
 <br>
 - Mmm.
 <br>
 - Oh, so can you help me move the mirror in the bathroom? - What mirror? The one covering up the window.
 <br>
 - Ah.
 <br>
 That was a great trip.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t wait to do it again.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Donna, I think I may have overreacted a little bit.
 <br>
 I mean, there are plenty ofTwinkies in the world.
 <br>
 I mean, sure, there was only one in the car, and you did go Godzilla on it but look, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, it didn&#39;t taste very good.
 <br>
 - I think it was a knockoff.
 <br>
 - Yeah, my mom buys &#39;&#39;Twonkies.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Look, Donna, we had a goal at the beginning of this trip.
 <br>
 We were gonna be romantic in some place new and different and I am a man who likes to finish what he started.
 <br>
 So may I suggest on my kitchen table? Wha- You know what? Okay.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Yeah, your parents won&#39;t be home until tomorrow.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going for this? Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 What the hell was in that &#39;&#39;Twonkie&#39;&#39;? - ( Door Slides Shut ) - ( Van Door Closes ) You believe that kid? First he doesn&#39;t show up, then he blocks the driveway.
 <br>
 Well, I will just be happy to get back in our nice, quiet house.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God! - ( Donna ) Oh, my God.
 <br>
 ! All right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Donna&#39;s butt.
 <br>
 Damn it! That&#39;s where I eat dinner! Scrub, damn it! I am scrubbing as hard as I can.
 <br>
 This cleanser isn&#39;t strong enough.
 <br>
 Kitty, it&#39;s bleach and lighter fluid.
 <br>
 There is nothing stronger.
 <br>
 Well, it is not strong enough.
 <br>
 - Nope.
 <br>
 No good.
 <br>
 - We need a new table.
 <br>
 <br>
