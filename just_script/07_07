<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Eric I found this in the garage and I want an explanation.
 <br>
 Okay, when people write stories and glue the pages together, it forms what we call a book, I don&#39;t want &#34;the joy of sex&#34; polluting my house.
 <br>
 &#34;The joy of sex.
 <br>
 &#34; What a load of crap.
 <br>
 That book&#39;s for perverts, red.
 <br>
 You should give it to me so I can sell it to fez.
 <br>
 Red, the book is mine.
 <br>
 I put it in the garage so you would find it.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m late for work.
 <br>
 No, no, no, I am serious.
 <br>
 It&#39;s high time you and i put some zip back in the bedroom.
 <br>
 I got a great idea.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll put a tv in the bedroom.
 <br>
 There&#39;s your zip.
 <br>
 Okay, I want the full fez treatment-- a wash, cream rinse and a lot of that wiggly stuff you do with your fingers.
 <br>
 It&#39;s magical.
 <br>
 Abracadabra, baby.
 <br>
 So, danielle, what&#39;s on your schedule today? I mean, besides looking beautiful.
 <br>
 Well, looking beautiful is from Ooh, hot date alert.
 <br>
 Tsss! It&#39;s not that hot.
 <br>
 The guy&#39;s kind of a knucklehead.
 <br>
 I mean, he&#39;s really cute, but it&#39;s like, when I talk, he&#39;s not paying attention to me.
 <br>
 Oh! I hear this complaint You&#39;re a treasure.
 <br>
 He should worship you like a big stone head.
 <br>
 You&#39;re so great.
 <br>
 You know, you really get women.
 <br>
 Well, if you mean &#34;get&#34; as in &#34;understand,&#34; then, yes, I get them.
 <br>
 But if you mean &#34;get&#34; as in &#34;get,&#34; then, no, never.
 <br>
 If I had a woman like you, I would give her anything her heart desired.
 <br>
 Maybe I should blow off my date and go out with a guy like you.
 <br>
 And when I say, &#34;a guy like you,&#34; I mean you, specifically.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 But just to be clear, I still have a tip coming, right? That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 07 &#34;Mothers little helper&#34; steven.
 <br>
 Steven, would you please stop doing that? You&#39;re gonna get all eric-Y.
 <br>
 Give.
 <br>
 Jackie, boys have to play fight because they secretly want to touch each other.
 <br>
 Yeah, you guys wish you could play fight.
 <br>
 But girls can&#39;t, &#39;cause it always turns into a real fight.
 <br>
 Are you seriously telling me that if jackie and i wanted to play fight, we couldn&#39;t? Um, let me listen for the echo of what I just said.
 <br>
 Girls can&#39;t play fight.
 <br>
 Yep! That&#39;s what I think.
 <br>
 I agree.
 <br>
 Girls are bitches.
 <br>
 Really? - Come on, jackie.
 <br>
 Put your dukes up.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Watch and learn, boys.
 <br>
 See, it&#39;s all fun and games.
 <br>
 Ow, you scratched me! Get off of me, bigfoot! Let go of my hair or I&#39;ll pound your tiny ass! - Spoilsport.
 <br>
 - Hey, yours is gonna kill mine.
 <br>
 Ladies,that was pathetic.
 <br>
 What? That wasn&#39;t even real.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re fine.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 I had fun.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re so immature! You guys aren&#39;t going to believe this.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Were two hot girls just fighting in here? No.
 <br>
 Someone is lying.
 <br>
 Anyway, I was just shampooing this foxy girl danielle, and the next thing I know, we&#39;re making out in the shampoo closet.
 <br>
 Wait a second, you&#39;re trying to tell me that you were shampooing a girl and she got so horny, she had to make out with you in the shampoo closet? That doesn&#39;t sound real, man.
 <br>
 That sounds like a mad lib.
 <br>
 Yeah, are you sure you weren&#39;t just kissing a mop? &#39;Cause, man, I&#39;ve seen you do that.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Danielle kept going on and on about this adorable knucklehead she was dating, and I just sympathized with her problems.
 <br>
 Well, that makes sense.
 <br>
 I mean, all a woman really wants is a man who listens.
 <br>
 I listen.
 <br>
 And doesn&#39;t pat himself on the back.
 <br>
 I never pat myself on the back.
 <br>
 So, yeah, I got that going for me.
 <br>
 You guys, something happened today that has never happened to me before.
 <br>
 Oh, you did long division? No, I got stood up.
 <br>
 I was supposed to meet this girl danielle after her haircut, and she never showed.
 <br>
 Danielle! Danielle? Okay, wait a second, first a girl fight and now this? I vote &#34;best day ever.
 <br>
 &#34; Kelso is the adorable knucklehead.
 <br>
 Hey, thanks, fez, but I&#39;m trying to tella story here.
 <br>
 Okay, so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why she didn&#39;t show, and I&#39;ve come to the only logical conclusion-- she&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 Kelso, maybe danielle met a guy that she likes better than you.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be crazy, fez.
 <br>
 Danielle is dead, and wecan never bring her back.
 <br>
 Kitty, we don&#39;t need &#34;the joy of sex.
 <br>
 &#34; Well,  why not? It&#39;s not dirty.
 <br>
 This book-- it doesn&#39;t even have photographs, just sketches.
 <br>
 But they&#39;re so detailed.
 <br>
 They draw in every single part.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s not to scale.
 <br>
 Oh, here&#39;s a fun idea.
 <br>
 okay.
 <br>
 Instead of throwing away our old dish towels, we can use them as blindfolds and play a sexy bedroom version of marco polo.
 <br>
 oh, come on.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you want to be one of those fun, older couples? Kitty, I want us to grow old and withdraw into ourselves.
 <br>
 Hey,  what&#39;s for lunch? Well, I was thinking of making something, but that would mean I would have to look at a cookbook, and I don&#39;t like to learn new things from books.
 <br>
 Yeah, so is lunch off or, um I mean, what&#39;s the lay of the lunch land here? I don&#39;t see why I have to read a book on bodily functions.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never read a book on eating, yet I&#39;m extremely well fed.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 Could I, like seriously, like a sandwich or well, you know what? Nobody is eating unless you give this book a try.
 <br>
 Until then, I quit cooking.
 <br>
 Wow, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m asking you this, but please have kinky sex with my mother.
 <br>
 No, danielle, I love your outfit.
 <br>
 But I just think you can always go tighter.
 <br>
 Oh, my god! Danielle, you&#39;re alive! Yeah, why wouldn&#39;t I be? Well, thenif you&#39;re not dead, then-- then why did you blow off our date? Look at him try and put it together.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got it now.
 <br>
 No, wait, he doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yeah, now--wow.
 <br>
 Not yet.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 This is, like, the slowest burn ever.
 <br>
 This is like how burns were in the Danielle stood you up so she could make out with the adorable new man in her life.
 <br>
 Ah--me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Ah--him.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t bump me.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t get in my way.
 <br>
 Well, maybe I wouldn&#39;t be in your way if you could sit still like a normal person instead of a vibrating spazoid.
 <br>
 Really? Well, guess what.
 <br>
 You fight like a poor girl.
 <br>
 get off me! get off me! this ain&#39;t over, squatty! Get off.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 Hey, if they&#39;re gonna keep this up, we should invest in a video camera.
 <br>
 All right, fez, stand up so I can kick your ass.
 <br>
 How dare you steal a girl out from under me! First of all, I can do whatever I want.
 <br>
 Second of all, when I stole her, she was not under you, she was under moi.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Whoa! Whoa! Guys, listen.
 <br>
 I just realized I am not strong enough to hold you two apart.
 <br>
 Hyde, come on.
 <br>
 Kelso, Maybe you shouldn&#39;t be asking what he did.
 <br>
 You should be asking what you did to let it happen.
 <br>
 Or what you didn&#39;t do.
 <br>
 You know, maybe you just lost your mojo.
 <br>
 Look, a guy can&#39;t just lose his mojo, okay? Can he? Well, when was the last time you made out with two girls at once? that was oh, no.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t remember.
 <br>
 Kissed four different girls in the same day? I don&#39;t know! You guys, I might&#39;ve lost my mojo.
 <br>
 And I got it.
 <br>
 I got your mojo.
 <br>
 Which reminds me, I also have your yo-yo, so I want &#39;em both back.
 <br>
 You know, how can I lose a girl to you? You don&#39;t even speak english.
 <br>
 Well, kelso, look at the bright side.
 <br>
 Danielle is a wonderful girl who likes me better than you.
 <br>
 Why is that the bright side? Because burn !!! these are stale.
 <br>
 Well, eat slow.
 <br>
 We gotta make &#39;em last.
 <br>
 Hey ya, red.
 <br>
 Eric told me you and kitty are having a little trouble in the old hee-hoo department.
 <br>
 You told bob? Are you out of your puny mind? Look, you have to work this stuff out with mom.
 <br>
 She hasn&#39;t fed us in three days.
 <br>
 Dad, I can&#39;t afford not to eat.
 <br>
 Yesterday I ate a raisin off the floor.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not even sure if it was really a raisin.
 <br>
 Look, red, you should take kitty&#39;s request for a love life spice up seriously.
 <br>
 When midge wanted to turbocharge our love life, it was really a symptom of a much deeper marital problem.
 <br>
 Yeah, that you were deviants.
 <br>
 Deviants? Well, the couple we were dating sure didn&#39;t seem to think so.
 <br>
 I&#39;m tellin&#39; you, this problem is not just about sex.
 <br>
 It isn&#39;t? Well, maybe she&#39;s just unhappy emotionally.
 <br>
 Wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful? No, red.
 <br>
 It means you have a problem.
 <br>
 And you have to deal with it.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess it&#39;s important that kitty get listened to.
 <br>
 Eric, go listen to your mother.
 <br>
 Why me? Because without food, you&#39;ll die first.
 <br>
 So,  danielle, tell me again how much more you like me than kelso.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re sensitive and thoughtful and understanding and very, very sexy.
 <br>
 Lady, don&#39;t ever stop talking.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re funny and sweet.
 <br>
 And did I mention? Very, very sexy.
 <br>
 Lady, you gotta shut up.
 <br>
 So, mom, in the interest of returning regular meal service to my now shattered life I&#39;m here to help.
 <br>
 So, uh, just tell me the problem beneath the dirty, gross problem.
 <br>
 Honey, there is none.
 <br>
 I just want your father and me to have more adventurous sexual intercourse.
 <br>
 Well, this is one of those times I&#39;m kinda happy my stomach&#39;s empty.
 <br>
 Um, look, instead of calling it, uh, sexual inter--ah.
 <br>
 Ahem.
 <br>
 Instead of calling it that, why don&#39;t we call it, like, a walk in the park? Fine.
 <br>
 I want your father and ito have more adventurous walks in the park.
 <br>
 I want to walk in the park in the kitchen.
 <br>
 walk in the park on a tuesday.
 <br>
 I even want to walk in the park in the park.
 <br>
 Okay, okay, okay.
 <br>
 Okay, um okay, um, mom, I think you&#39;re-- you&#39;re playing this all wrong.
 <br>
 Dad wants you to have a deeper emotional issue.
 <br>
 Invent one.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll give you anything you want to avoid talking about walks in the park.
 <br>
 So think big.
 <br>
 You know, I might be able to get you diamonds here.
 <br>
 Maybe even a new car.
 <br>
 This is like emotional &#34;price is right,&#34; baby.
 <br>
 You&#39;re in the showcase.
 <br>
 Oh! I also want to walk in the park during &#34;the price is right.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, what&#39;s the news? You better start studying.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 So I spent the whole day thinking about what happened with danielle.
 <br>
 And I realized that I shouldn&#39;t be mad at you.
 <br>
 I should be asking you for help.
 <br>
 Holy crap, man.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re asking fez for girl advice? Next thing you know donna&#39;s gonna be asking forman how to throw a ball.
 <br>
 Look, he&#39;s the one with the girl.
 <br>
 All right, fez.
 <br>
 So where&#39;d I go wrong? Well, danielle said you were a bad listener and I&#39;m a good listener.
 <br>
 I heard her.
 <br>
 But so what? I hurt girls all the time.
 <br>
 No, not &#34;hurt.
 <br>
 &#34; Heard.
 <br>
 I heard.
 <br>
 - You heard what? - Danielle.
 <br>
 I heard danielle.
 <br>
 Why&#39;d she choose you over me? Jeez.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like talking to a 2 year old here.
 <br>
 She chose fez because he listens when a woman talks instead of staring at her chest.
 <br>
 Stop staring at my chest! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ve been screwed by darwinism.
 <br>
 I never needed to evolve listening skills &#39;cause my looks are so highly developed.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s not how evolution works.
 <br>
 Yeah, sure it is.
 <br>
 Look, say I had to catch my own food, right? But I only ate really fast animals.
 <br>
 My feet would eventually evolve into rockets.
 <br>
 Man, it&#39;s amazing your brain doesn&#39;t evolve into pudding.
 <br>
 All right, fez,come on.
 <br>
 I need your help.
 <br>
 Why should I help you? B-because you owe me.
 <br>
 Think about all the times that I set you up with my dates&#39; less-pretty friends.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 You have thrown me some uggos.
 <br>
 All right, so show a little appreciation.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But you have to promise not to use what I teach you on danielle to get her back.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 - Done.
 <br>
 Okay, donna, I need your help.
 <br>
 Now sit here and pretend to be a girl.
 <br>
 Now tell a girlie story.
 <br>
 Kelso, you listen and repeat back whatever she says.
 <br>
 - Okay, you ready? - Yeah.
 <br>
 kelso, I had the worst day.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know what shoes to wear-- with a heel, without a heel I&#39;m running out of firecrackers.
 <br>
 I bet I could a been best friends with spider-man.
 <br>
 Is that a new muscle? Well, hello, new muscle.
 <br>
 Welcome to kelso town.
 <br>
 Kelso.
 <br>
 Kelso! What? You weren&#39;t even listening.
 <br>
 How do you know? &#39;Cause you were staring at the ceiling with your tongue hanging out.
 <br>
 Kelso, when a woman talks, you have to look her in the eyes and pretend her words are like oxygen and without them, you can&#39;t breathe.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t care what she says.
 <br>
 How the heck did you ever get a girl? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I just stare at her until she stops talking, then I kiss her.
 <br>
 Unbelievable.
 <br>
 All right, kitty.
 <br>
 I want you to be happy,I really do.
 <br>
 And to make that beautiful, illusive dream come true, I&#39;m willing to try page 46.
 <br>
 Really? Oh, red, thank you.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Page 46-- that is so fancy.
 <br>
 what? Oh,  dear god, no! Not, uh, not page 46.
 <br>
 I meant page 47.
 <br>
 Page 47.
 <br>
 And no funny stuff after I fall asleep.
 <br>
 And I didn&#39;t know what to do because I had just polished my nails and I didn&#39;t wanna mess up my manicure.
 <br>
 You&#39;re such a good listener.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t take it anymore.
 <br>
 What are you doing? Get off my lady! - Fez! - You shut your hot little mouth.
 <br>
 You promised you wouldn&#39;t use anything I taught you on danielle.
 <br>
 Come on, you can&#39;t give me a gun and expect me not to shoot people with it.
 <br>
 Danielle, you have to choose.
 <br>
 Him or me? - But I-- - I said choose, woman! Well, fez, if I have to choose between the two of you, I mean, the choice is obvious.
 <br>
 I choose you, fez.
 <br>
 What are you, stupid? I mean, I mean, of course.
 <br>
 Yes, good choice.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Him? How can you choose him? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I guess I have this thing for guys who boss me around.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll meet you in the car, or wherever you tell me to meet you.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;ll meet me in the car,and you&#39;ll like it.
 <br>
 I will.
 <br>
 Okay, here&#39;s the thing, fez she&#39;s clearly a lunatic, which means that she&#39;sgonna be super hot in bed, so congratulations on that one.
 <br>
 But you did snake her from me.
 <br>
 So I get a free punch.
 <br>
 But you did snake her back, so How do guys play fight without getting into a real fight? Well, maybe&#39;cause when they fight, michael doesn&#39;t elbow everything like a blonde tard-O.
 <br>
 See? Now that is gonna get your ass kicked.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m gonna punch you in your fat melon head.
 <br>
 Good luck reaching it, tiny loser.
 <br>
 Thanks, tommy.
 <br>
 Is that bacon I smell? Oh, what a perfect morning.
 <br>
 - Marco! - Polo! Oh, my god!
 <br>
