<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Now, Michael- Michael, for your yearbook picture don&#39;t forget to do the over-the-shoulder shot.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the best one.
 <br>
 Ah, yeah.
 <br>
 I love that pose.
 <br>
 It makes me look coy.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, Tommy Hedges just got his picture taken with a big, old booger.
 <br>
 So, why were you in Tommy Hedges&#39;s picture? So, wait.
 <br>
 He had a booger, and you didn&#39;t tell him? He&#39;ll find out.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be in the yearbook.
 <br>
 It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how I found out I was adorable.
 <br>
 No, seriously.
 <br>
 The only thing more important than your yearbook picture is your yearbook quote.
 <br>
 Ah, I already got that covered.
 <br>
 My quote&#39;s gonna be, &#39;&#39;What a long, strange trip it&#39;s been.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yeah, that&#39;s freakin&#39; profound.
 <br>
 Kelso, every lame-o hippie in the history of time has used that quote.
 <br>
 Well, yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s &#39;cause it&#39;s good.
 <br>
 No, Michael.
 <br>
 Your quote has to be meaningful so you can remember the good times when you&#39;re, like, 30, with no reason left to live.
 <br>
 Okay, hidden in Jackie&#39;s extremely disturbing thought is a grain of truth.
 <br>
 We need a really good quote this year.
 <br>
 Well, all the best quotes are about things that mean a lot to you.
 <br>
 Like, for example, me.
 <br>
 Or my hair, or my personality or the sparkle I bring to your dull, gray lives.
 <br>
 Or the feeling of relief we get when you leave the room.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You know what? We need a quote about all of us.
 <br>
 - Like, maybe like how we all met.
 <br>
 - Remember how we first met? Oh, is this a sexy story? - It&#39;s really more sad than sexy.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s pretty much how it goes for you, isn&#39;t it? Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, now, got your brownies for the new neighbors, Eric? Yes, Mommy.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) How do I look? - Well, you got a little something- - Don&#39;t touch it! I had to sleep sitting up to keep it like this.
 <br>
 Well, I just hope these new neighbors are better than the last one.
 <br>
 That Gus Griffin was a complete dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Hiya, neighbors! Well, hello.
 <br>
 We were just coming to welcome you.
 <br>
 Looks like we beat you to the punchity-punch.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Oh, damn.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Bob Pinciotti.
 <br>
 This is my daughter, Donna.
 <br>
 My wife Midge&#39;ll be over later.
 <br>
 Her thumb&#39;s caught in something right now.
 <br>
 Well, we&#39;ve all done that.
 <br>
 I guess.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m Kitty, and this is Red and this is our son Eric.
 <br>
 ( Giggles ) Eric, say hello to Donna.
 <br>
 What are you looking at, string bean? ( Gasps ) Wow.
 <br>
 You&#39;re strong.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) - ( Chuckles ) Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! - ( All Laughing ) - That&#39;s-Yeah, go ahead and laugh.
 <br>
 None of you were punched by Madam Man-fist here.
 <br>
 You were creepy.
 <br>
 What can I say? Forman beat up by a girl.
 <br>
 Seems like only yesterday.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 I think it happened yesterday too.
 <br>
 That&#39;s- You like that story, Hyde? Maybe I should talk about the first time you and I met.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 - No! - Yes.
 <br>
 - You promised! - I&#39;m telling! Thanks for walking me home, Steven.
 <br>
 That redheaded girl hits really hard.
 <br>
 Some advice? Never let a girl stand on your head like that.
 <br>
 Bad for the rep.
 <br>
 - Okay, Steven.
 <br>
 - And it&#39;s Hyde.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 Hey, wouldn&#39;t it be funny if my last name was Seek? You know, Hyde and Seek! That&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 And you owe me a quarter.
 <br>
 Well, now.
 <br>
 Who do we have here? This is Hyde.
 <br>
 Oh, you have a new little friend.
 <br>
 Red, get the camera.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not his friend.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a hired gun.
 <br>
 Kitty, don&#39;t embarrass the boy.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t be silly.
 <br>
 It&#39;s nice to have a new friend.
 <br>
 Especially one who&#39;s so dirty! ( Chuckles ) You know what&#39;s fun? I&#39;m sorry, Son.
 <br>
 If you ever tell anyone about this, I&#39;ll kill you.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Now I have to kill you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I like to bathe with friends.
 <br>
 They can reach places you can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s probably best kept to yourself, buddy.
 <br>
 You guys, look at Eric&#39;s last-year&#39;s picture.
 <br>
 The famous makeup-covered zit.
 <br>
 Look, I just wanted one year of clear skin to remember.
 <br>
 And if that means breaking out the old powder puff so be it.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve never really had a zit-free picture.
 <br>
 Remember the one on his nose? Oh, and the one on his lip? And the one on the one on his lip? And the one we thought was a second little alien Eric growing out of his cheek? ( Deep Voice ) I mean no harm to your planet.
 <br>
 I will attack if you attempt to pop me.
 <br>
 Ah, zits.
 <br>
 Hey, those days are over, okay? I&#39;m zit-free this year, and you want to know why? - I have become a man.
 <br>
 - ( All Laugh ) No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 I am man.
 <br>
 I am zitless.
 <br>
 Hear me roar.
 <br>
 That should be our yearbook quote.
 <br>
 What about a quote from the happiest day of our lives? - When was that? - The day you met me.
 <br>
 And then Potsie says, &#39;&#39;Sit on it.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughs ) Right to the Fonz&#39;s face! Now, that&#39;s brave! - Hey, what&#39;s with Donna? - What? We&#39;re just friends.
 <br>
 God, why would you even ask that? I don&#39;t like her.
 <br>
 Me and Donna? It&#39;s- It&#39;s gross! Hey, man, I was just asking why she wasn&#39;t in class today.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, then, never mind.
 <br>
 Busted! ( Fez ) Help.
 <br>
 ! Americans, please help me.
 <br>
 ! - What was that? - It&#39;s coming from in here.
 <br>
 Oh, hello.
 <br>
 Who the hell are you? I am the new foreign exchange student.
 <br>
 The football team asked me if I wanted to &#39;&#39;hang out.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I shouldn&#39;t have said yes.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t feel my legs.
 <br>
 - What are you gonna do? - I&#39;m gonna chuck it at him.
 <br>
 No, man.
 <br>
 Leave him alone.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) ( Sighs ) Look, man, if those jocks try to do this to you again,just come find me.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 You are my best friend.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s hold hands.
 <br>
 Uh, no.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m Hyde.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m Eric.
 <br>
 - Oh, you&#39;re the one that loves Donna.
 <br>
 - I do not! Well, my name is- - ( Bell Ringing ) - ( Inaudible ) Okay, I&#39;m not gonna remember that.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s call him Captain Poo-face! Oh! Ow! My eye! God! Yeah, this happens a lot.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure it does, Donna lover.
 <br>
 Aww! I forgot about Captain Poo-face! And I did not like her then! Damn! You know what I love about Kelso? Hyde just keeps beating the crap out of him.
 <br>
 ( Stammering ) That is false! - Name one time! - With pleasure.
 <br>
 - I love mashed potatoes.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah? ( Chuckles ) Uh-oh.
 <br>
 ( Kelso Grunts ) Not my eye.
 <br>
 ! - Foul! - You know what&#39;s foul? Your playing.
 <br>
 Ow! Oh, that&#39;s my eye! God! ( Dial Clicks ) ( TV: Instrumental ) - Change it back.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Change it back.
 <br>
 No-o-o.
 <br>
 ( Kelso Groans ) - My eye.
 <br>
 ! - ( Dial Clicks ) Seriously, man.
 <br>
 You keep hurting my eye.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a terrible story.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not even in that one.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s what makes it good.
 <br>
 Okay, people, please remain calm.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still zit-free.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna make it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna make it! Okay, stop goofing around.
 <br>
 We need to think of a better memory.
 <br>
 What about the day I met you? All of you.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna like Donna.
 <br>
 She&#39;s pretty cool, man.
 <br>
 - ( Gasps ) Hyde! - Wow! Sorry.
 <br>
 Wow! - What? - You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I like her! No, wait! I didn&#39;t see! Wait! - ( Knocking ) - ( Kelso ) Donna? Now, that&#39;s a good memory.
 <br>
 Or should I say &#39;&#39;mammary&#39;&#39;? I don&#39;t want to remember that story.
 <br>
 It just reminds me that I&#39;m the only one here who&#39;s never seen Donna&#39;s jahoobs.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s not like you never tried.
 <br>
 Oops, sorry! Aw, damn.
 <br>
 Oops, sorry! Aw, damn.
 <br>
 Oops, sorry! Damn it! Hey, speaking of boobs Forman&#39;s growin&#39; one out of his forehead.
 <br>
 What? Oh, Eric, your curse has returned.
 <br>
 ( Snickering ) Yeah, and it needs a bra.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Dolly Parton called your forehead.
 <br>
 She wants her boob back.
 <br>
 God, I can actually see this thing growing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s likeJiffy Pop.
 <br>
 My friend once- He had this really big zit.
 <br>
 And he tried to pop it and all the pus went into his brain, and it killed him.
 <br>
 Really, Kelso? What friend? - You didn&#39;t know him.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s &#39;cause he doesn&#39;t exist.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause he&#39;s dead now! People, we are losing focus here.
 <br>
 Well, what is our quote gonna be? And let&#39;s remember, our goal is to have it be about me.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t think about anything right now except Forman&#39;s zit.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hypnotic.
 <br>
 - It sort of follows you around the room like the Mona Lisa.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Hey, you wanna know something that&#39;s even funnier than Eric&#39;s zit? The day I metJackie.
 <br>
 You&#39;re Donna? We haven&#39;t met before.
 <br>
 I guess because I&#39;m richer than you.
 <br>
 - Hey,Jackie.
 <br>
 - Ow! That hurt, you lumberjack! Welcome to public school.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I missed that.
 <br>
 You know, when you laugh you get a little wrinkle in your zit.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got personality.
 <br>
 Okay, well, what am I supposed to do? It hurts way too much to pop.
 <br>
 Come here, man.
 <br>
 Let me see it.
 <br>
 Aah! What? Quit it! Yeah, Kelso&#39;s friend died that way.
 <br>
 Donna, he did! Whatever.
 <br>
 Look, all I know is there&#39;s gotta be some good quote offJackie getting hit in the head.
 <br>
 Like, &#39;&#39;Awesome! Jackie got hit in the head!&#39;&#39; No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a stupid story.
 <br>
 You know, I want to remember the happy times.
 <br>
 Maybe something romantic.
 <br>
 Ooh, like our first date.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Let me tell it.
 <br>
 Red, Michael&#39;s in the fort with another girl.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Everybody out.
 <br>
 Michael Kelso, have you been playing doctor with the Burkhart girl? No.
 <br>
 I am a doctor.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Good one.
 <br>
 I mean, uh, you&#39;re a very bad boy.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t yell at him! I love him.
 <br>
 Michael, that was not our first date! Yeah, but I got further on that day than I did on our actual first date, so that&#39;s what I like to remember.
 <br>
 Yeah, you made a great impression on my parents that year.
 <br>
 Hi, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Is Eric home? Um, yes but, uh- Kitty? Oh, my.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Michael, honey, did you maybe forget something? What? My pants! ( All Laughing ) Why doesn&#39;t anyone just tell nice stories? Everyone can think of a quote.
 <br>
 I mean, why can&#39;t we? Hey, why don&#39;t we use Lisa Manning&#39;s? &#39;&#39;Hangin&#39; at the mall.
 <br>
 Kahlúa and ice cream.
 <br>
 Bobby Sutton&#39;s a god.
 <br>
 Yeah!&#39;&#39; God, this is so sad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like, what have we been doing with our lives? Hey, Kelso, who&#39;s got stronger powers- I Dream ofJeannie or Samantha from Bewitched? That&#39;s easy.
 <br>
 Samantha.
 <br>
 Witches totally beat genies &#39;cause witches can fly.
 <br>
 Game over.
 <br>
 Hey, why does Jeannie wear those see-through clothes? It&#39;s gross.
 <br>
 And it makes me feel funny.
 <br>
 No way is Samantha hotter than Jeannie! Hey, I heard they made an episode they never aired whereJeannie gets totally naked.
 <br>
 The government banned it.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) All I know is, with one little nose twitch Samantha&#39;s clothes could be off!.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s hot.
 <br>
 What if you didn&#39;t have to choose? What if you could be with both at the same time? Is that legal? Hey, man, if you don&#39;t get caught everything&#39;s legal.
 <br>
 Stolen pretzel? Guys, this conversation is over.
 <br>
 Yesterday, Samantha went back in time.
 <br>
 That trumps anything Jeannie ever did.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah? Well,Jeannie can freeze time.
 <br>
 So, Samantha would go back, and Jeannie could just freeze her there.
 <br>
 Who kicked whose ass then? You know what would decide this whole thing? A little Samantha-on-Jeannie mud wrestling.
 <br>
 I&#39;d pay a dollar to see that.
 <br>
 All I know is, Samantha helps Darrin at work but what does Jeannie do for Major Nelson? Turns his boss into a monkey.
 <br>
 This is not helpful.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got to call Major Nelson&#39;s sexuality into question here.
 <br>
 I mean, any guy who&#39;s got a half-naked genie- He&#39;s got her doing more than his laundry.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what would be best? Samantha&#39;s hair, Jeannie&#39;s pretty bottle room and Wonder Woman&#39;s accessories.
 <br>
 - ( Imitates Bullets Ricocheting ) - ( Chuckles ) Hey, guys.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve been talking about this for a really, really long time.
 <br>
 Oh! Ooh! - ( All Laughing ) - ( Group Singing Blues Rock ) ( Ends ) I got it! I got the quote! &#39;&#39;What a long, strange trip it&#39;s been in Forman&#39;s basement.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - ( All Chuckling ) - Yeah.
 <br>
 We have made a lot of memories in that basement.
 <br>
 Too bad we can&#39;t remember any of&#39;em.
 <br>
 All right, you guys.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s ready.
 <br>
 I&#39;m off to pop.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 I hate that quote.
 <br>
 My name isn&#39;t anywhere in that quote.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ll just make my quote &#39;&#39;What a long, strange trip it&#39;s been with Jackie Burkhart.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Yeah, okay but without the &#39;&#39;long, strange trip&#39;&#39; part.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 So I&#39;ll just write- - &#39;&#39;I loveJackie Burkhart.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, guys, I did it.
 <br>
 Looks better, right? ( All Agreeing ) Great.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Picture time.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ll meet you guys in there.
 <br>
 I gotta change my blouse.
 <br>
 Everybody out.
 <br>
 - Oops, sorry! - Kelso! Kelso, we just talked about this today! Well, damn, Donna.
 <br>
 If you&#39;d just let me see &#39;em, I&#39;d stop.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 ( Angelic Choir Vocalizing ) They&#39;re beautiful.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Ooh,yeah Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
