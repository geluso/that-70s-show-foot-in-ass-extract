<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, you guys! Great news! I was walking around Halverson&#39;s Department Store and the owner comes right up to me, and he offered me a modeling job.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Whoo! Wait, wait.
 <br>
 He just offered you a modeling job? Yeah, sounds a little suspicious.
 <br>
 I mean, how do you know it was the owner? Because it was Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson.
 <br>
 How do you know it was Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson? Because I said, &#39;&#39;Aren&#39;t you Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson?&#39;&#39; And he said, &#39;&#39;Yeah.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - Hey, Hyde, aren&#39;t you Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson? - Yeah.
 <br>
 See? Look, Michael.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been in that store over a hundred times and Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson never asked me to be a model.
 <br>
 And if Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson never asked me to be a model then there&#39;s no Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a scam.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t sound like a scam to me.
 <br>
 - Thank you, Donna.
 <br>
 - Sounds like Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson wants you for his lover.
 <br>
 ( Kissing ) Either way, I&#39;m flattered.
 <br>
 Hyde, will you teach me how to drive the El Camino? Rhonda&#39;s car is a stick and until I learn to drive it I have to sit in the lady seat.
 <br>
 No way, man.
 <br>
 The Camino&#39;s cherry.
 <br>
 - Please? - No.
 <br>
 Please, please, please? No.
 <br>
 Please, please, please, please, please, please please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
 <br>
 Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please please, please, please, please, please, please - please, please, please, please, please, please, pl- - All right! All right! ( Sighs ) You can use the El Camino.
 <br>
 But you have to be careful, all right? I don&#39;t want anything to happen to my baby.
 <br>
 Aw, thanks for your concern, Hyde, but I&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 And let out the clutch gently, okay? - &#39;Cause this car&#39;s very powerful.
 <br>
 - Hyde! We&#39;ve been sitting here for half an hour.
 <br>
 Will you just shut your hole and let me drive? Okay, you&#39;re clear.
 <br>
 - ( Tires Squealing ) - ( Cat Screeches ) In front of you.
 <br>
 Man, I picked a bad place to take a nap.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Hey, Todd, I&#39;m gonna take my break now.
 <br>
 - Michael&#39;s stopping by.
 <br>
 - Still dating that guy? I guess that&#39;s fine if you like the handsome type.
 <br>
 But does he have a picture of himself with the guy who played Chewbacca? &#39;Cause I do.
 <br>
 Hey,Jackie! More great modeling news.
 <br>
 They&#39;re startin&#39; me in underwear.
 <br>
 Look, I got a W-4 and a body-waxing kit and everything.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re really an underwear model? No, not just underwear- briefs.
 <br>
 I mean, usually, you have to spend a year cutting your teeth in boxers before you even get into the tight stuff.
 <br>
 You know what? I don&#39;t have time for this right now.
 <br>
 It just isn&#39;t important.
 <br>
 - But,Jackie- - Hey, maybe you didn&#39;t hear the lady.
 <br>
 She&#39;s busy.
 <br>
 So hit the road, guy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m her boyfriend, guy.
 <br>
 Nuh-uh.
 <br>
 When she works here her boyfriend is every man, woman and child that walks in here for cheese.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t have any money for cheese.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m going to go get some, and then we&#39;ll see whose boyfriend is whose.
 <br>
 Let me tell you something,Jackie.
 <br>
 As a roving associate junior manager for Cheese Palace, Incorporated I&#39;ve seen a lot of things- some I can&#39;t talk about.
 <br>
 But I will tell you two things.
 <br>
 One: With the German population that this town has we should be moving a lot more sausage.
 <br>
 Two: You&#39;re a stone-cold fox.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve said too much.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in the cooler.
 <br>
 Now, if your gown falls open again there&#39;s no need to ring the little buzzer.
 <br>
 You can just cover up by yourself.
 <br>
 Okay, um, I&#39;ll be right back with your &#39;&#39;blankie.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - &#39;&#39;Thankie.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - ( Kitty Laughs ) Leo, I&#39;m so sorry I hurt you.
 <br>
 Ah, that&#39;s all right, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Least I still got it all up here.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s just good genes, man.
 <br>
 My father had a good hairline too.
 <br>
 Well, nice job, Fez.
 <br>
 The fender&#39;s dented, the taillight&#39;s shot, so you owe me 80 bucks.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Okay, good luck with that.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m broke.
 <br>
 - Well, like my mom used to tell me &#39;&#39;Shut up and give me some money.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Hey, you guys, I was just next door and you know that weird kid from school who&#39;s always saying he can fly? Yeah, he can&#39;t.
 <br>
 So, Leo, how&#39;s the hospital? Oh, it&#39;s great, man.
 <br>
 Cable TV, free parking don&#39;t have to get out of bed to take a pee.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just like a hotel.
 <br>
 ( Hyde Groans ) And Nurse Kitty and I have had some good times.
 <br>
 ( Man Singing Pop Ballad ) ( Ends ) ( Knocking ) Okay, Leo, I&#39;m going to get you a surprise dessert.
 <br>
 It jiggles and it rhymes with &#39;&#39;jerry chello.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I love you too, Kitty.
 <br>
 I love you too.
 <br>
 ( Singing Pop Ballad ) ( Humming ) ( Singing Ends ) Hey, Eric, um, where&#39;s Donna? Oh, she&#39;s out with Kelso&#39;s brother.
 <br>
 Which means it&#39;s only a matter of time before she calls us from the holding cell.
 <br>
 Well, I need a woman&#39;s opinion.
 <br>
 Eh, you&#39;re close enough.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just really upset about Michael modeling.
 <br>
 I mean, that was our dream together.
 <br>
 But for me! ( Man Singing Commercial Jingle ) ( Continues ) ( Ends ) Wait, so, um, in your dream you&#39;re a model, and Kelso&#39;s, um, not there.
 <br>
 Whereas in real life, Kelso&#39;s a model and you, um, sell cheese.
 <br>
 That is delightful.
 <br>
 ( Doorbell Rings ) Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Could you give these to your wife, please? And tell her I love her.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give her the message.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Oh, boy! You got a date for the Stoners&#39; Ball.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Roses are red.
 <br>
 Violets are blue.
 <br>
 Milk, eggs, coffee.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Who&#39;s the most handsome man on earth? ( Electronic Voice ) U-R.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;ve thought about your modeling job, and I came to a decision.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t let you take your pants off in public.
 <br>
 But I take my pants off in public all the time.
 <br>
 You never said anything before.
 <br>
 Because before you weren&#39;t doing it for your glamorous new career.
 <br>
 You were doing it for the love of being pantsless.
 <br>
 So, now promise me you won&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 ( Whimpers ) - Michael? - Fine.
 <br>
 I &#39;&#39;plomise.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I heard that.
 <br>
 You said, &#39;&#39;I plomise.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; There is no &#39;&#39;L&#39;&#39; in promise.
 <br>
 Michael, promise me with an &#39;&#39;R.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Whimpers ) Fine! I pr-o-o-mise.
 <br>
 Okay, you promise to what? I promise I won&#39;t model my &#39;&#39;undelwear.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Michael! Oh, fine! That jerk.
 <br>
 He really is a jerk.
 <br>
 And you smell nice.
 <br>
 So? Does it make you wanna buy underwear? - No, it makes me wonder who this guy is you&#39;re massaging.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s Daryl.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not massaging.
 <br>
 It&#39;s posing.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 God, he&#39;s got a girlfriend.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a girlfriend.
 <br>
 Yeah, and her name is Daryl.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 Got that 80 bucks yet for the El Camino? As a matter of fact, I do happen to not have it yet.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t I hold on to this until you do.
 <br>
 My candy.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll get your 80 bucks in hell! Hey,Jackie, how&#39;s it going? You know, Michael, not so good.
 <br>
 You lied to me and you stole my dream.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going besides that? You knew I always wanted to be a model and you took the job anyways.
 <br>
 I mean, if Mr.
 <br>
 Halverson had offered me a job as a spaceman I would have said no, &#39;cause that&#39;s your dream.
 <br>
 I thought that out of everyone that you would be the one to be happy for me, &#39;cause you&#39;re supposed to love me.
 <br>
 Well, if that&#39;s what you expected from me then obviously you don&#39;t know me very well.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, when you&#39;re ready to apologize I&#39;ll be downstairs modeling stuff.
 <br>
 But, Michael! ( Sighs ) Damn! Man, if I was your boyfriend I&#39;d be giving up modeling for you, and then taking it back up again just so I could give it up again.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m off to the Fotohut.
 <br>
 Hope my new boyfriend doesn&#39;t try to make a pass at me.
 <br>
 I- I don&#39;t think we have to worry about that.
 <br>
 I see.
 <br>
 Kitty, I just mean the whole thing is so silly.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just so silly.
 <br>
 It&#39;s silly.
 <br>
 Well, it didn&#39;t used to be silly.
 <br>
 I remember a time when you&#39;d beat up a guy just for looking at me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 come on, Kitty.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not worried about you and other guys.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re a little old for crushes.
 <br>
 What? Oh, I didn&#39;t mean old.
 <br>
 I meant advanced in beauty.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Michael and I had a fight.
 <br>
 Maybe if we pretend she&#39;s not here, she&#39;ll just go away.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve tried.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t work.
 <br>
 - Mm.
 <br>
 Look, he actually stood up to me.
 <br>
 Things are changing between us.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t know how to keep &#39;em the same.
 <br>
 I mean, he&#39;s not just modeling.
 <br>
 He&#39;s, like, leaving me behind.
 <br>
 Look,Jackie, you just- You can&#39;t keep trying to control him.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s how Eric ran me off.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s- Thank you.
 <br>
 Uh, thank you for that.
 <br>
 Look,Jackie.
 <br>
 Take it from a guy who pretty much hasn&#39;t been to second base in over two months.
 <br>
 You gotta let him have his own life.
 <br>
 You know, maybe you guys are right.
 <br>
 Maybe the only way to keep someone you love is by letting them go.
 <br>
 You know, a teacher told me that once.
 <br>
 But she had grown-up braces, so I didn&#39;t listen.
 <br>
 ( Doorbell Rings ) Oh, no.
 <br>
 Yup, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Hey, is my lady around? Leo, buddy, we gotta talk.
 <br>
 You&#39;re getting me in a lot of trouble around here.
 <br>
 - Now, I&#39;m begging you- - ( Kitty ) Who is it, Red? Listen, hophead! I love that woman with a fiery passion that consumes my soul! That&#39;s right! So you can either walk outta here on your own or you can hop outta here with my boot in your ass! Okay, I choose the one with nothing in my ass.
 <br>
 Good choice! Well, Red that was a pretty good show you put on there.
 <br>
 You poured it on with a &#39;&#39;fiery passion that consumed your soul.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Hey, if you think I&#39;m puttin&#39; on a show to get out of the doghouse you&#39;re way off base.
 <br>
 If I wanted to get out of trouble, I&#39;d just tell you how pretty you look.
 <br>
 Which I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you.
 <br>
 You do.
 <br>
 - Oh, stow it.
 <br>
 - Oh, fine.
 <br>
 But, Kitty, you gotta understand.
 <br>
 If I got mad at every guy that looked at you, I&#39;d drive myself crazy.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even wanna think about all those patients down at the hospital making googly eyes at you.
 <br>
 Not to mention the doctors.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t get me started on those perverts! They think the nursing staff is their own personal dating service.
 <br>
 Glorified plumbers! Okay.
 <br>
 All right, Red.
 <br>
 You&#39;re getting very upset.
 <br>
 In fact, you look downright miserable.
 <br>
 That makes me so happy.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 I just went to the store.
 <br>
 Check out my new empty bag.
 <br>
 Empty bag, huh? If it&#39;s empty, why are you so excited? Well, because of its amazing potential for storage.
 <br>
 Storage, huh? It better be storing an El Camino taillight.
 <br>
 Candy again? You sick bastard! You keep your distance, scalawag.
 <br>
 Hey! If you guys don&#39;t shut up the phrase &#39;&#39;empty bag&#39;&#39; is gonna take on a whole new meaning for you.
 <br>
 - Huh? - What? It&#39;s a thinker.
 <br>
 But trust me, you don&#39;t want it to happen.
 <br>
 Now, Hyde, you want money.
 <br>
 Fez doesn&#39;t have it.
 <br>
 So we just need to think of something Fez can give you that&#39;s worth 80 bucks.
 <br>
 Eighteen dollars is your change.
 <br>
 Have a nice day.
 <br>
 Now, I know totally nude Fez isn&#39;t original but everyone seems to be happy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy too.
 <br>
 Hey, man, remember the three-foot rule.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll stay right over here.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Okay, the ball&#39;s your best friend.
 <br>
 Give it a big smile.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re mad at the ball.
 <br>
 Oh, I hate you.
 <br>
 Bad ball.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t expect to see you here.
 <br>
 Well, I didn&#39;t expect to come.
 <br>
 But I did a lot of thinking, and- No, no.
 <br>
 Wh-What is it now? You want me to drop out of high school? Join the Salvation Army and go off and fight wars? I came here to talk to you about your modeling, and- Yeah,Jackie, I don&#39;t have time for it right now.
 <br>
 It just isn&#39;t important.
 <br>
 Sound familiar? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 - You should go now.
 <br>
 - Wait, but- Okay.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s build a sand castle.
 <br>
 Oh, and it&#39;s your favorite thing in the world.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 ! Hey, somejerk just kicked it over.
 <br>
 Boo-hoo-hoo.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Todd, what are you doing here? I saw you fighting with Michael.
 <br>
 I thought there might be a problem.
 <br>
 Even though I really hope there&#39;s not a problem.
 <br>
 Is there a problem? Yeah, I think so.
 <br>
 Well, you know what would make you feel better? Coming to see a movie with me.
 <br>
 You know what? Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 How may I help you? You could help me by getting some pants on.
 <br>
 And for the lady? I&#39;ll have what he&#39;s having.
 <br>
 Say, don&#39;t come to my house anymore.
 <br>
 Go, honey, go!
 <br>
