<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Yeah, that&#39;s right, Yeah, the wife and I are redoing the front lawn.
 <br>
 And, tell you what, if I&#39;m not there just dump it all on the front porch.
 <br>
 Bye-bye.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, Coach Jefferson is gonna freak.
 <br>
 Yeah, he just shouldn&#39;t have given me that &#34;D.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, no.
 <br>
 Dick Tracy is trapped in a giant clam.
 <br>
 Farewell, sweet Dick! A man being eaten by a giant clam.
 <br>
 Now, I&#39;m not Sigmund Freud, but Eric.
 <br>
 The Omen is playing at the drive-in.
 <br>
 You know what this means for us? It&#39;s make-out city.
 <br>
 I really like you as a friend, Kelso.
 <br>
 Can I bring a girl? Yeah.
 <br>
 Man, it&#39;s gonna be great.
 <br>
 Horror movies turn on chicks faster than porno.
 <br>
 Really? Faster than that? Yeah.
 <br>
 If only somebody would make a porno horror movie.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Then there&#39;d be no stopping you.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Is that kid from, not America down here? - Dad, it&#39;s Fez.
 <br>
 - Yeah, whatever.
 <br>
 The Erdmans called and they want him to go home.
 <br>
 Kelso, stop saying &#34;porno.
 <br>
 &#34; I didn&#39;t say it, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Fez did.
 <br>
 You are a bitch.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Okay, you know what this is, Red? Some lady magazine.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s Cosmo.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna tell you something, Red.
 <br>
 I just took the &#34;how spontaneous is your relationship?&#34; quiz.
 <br>
 And you know what? - What? - We got three out of ten.
 <br>
 And I cheated.
 <br>
 Gee, I can&#39;t help but notice that you&#39;re pouting.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not pouting.
 <br>
 That would upset our routine.
 <br>
 God knows, I wouldn&#39;t want to move in a new direction and accidentally slip in a puddle of fun or anything.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a thought.
 <br>
 How about you and I treat ourselves to a night out? Just the two of us.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be great, Red.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll go to Phillies.
 <br>
 Phillies? So you&#39;ll have the Salisbury steak, and I&#39;ll have the baked chicken.
 <br>
 Again.
 <br>
 Maybe I won&#39;t have the Salisbury steak.
 <br>
 I enjoy their ham.
 <br>
 Oh, ham.
 <br>
 Okay, then I can change one answer on the quiz.
 <br>
 So, okay, we have four out of ten.
 <br>
 We have moved up from &#34;predictable as the tides&#34; to &#34;humdrum.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;ll just go change.
 <br>
 Damn Cosmo.
 <br>
 Son, when we took you in as an exchange student you became our responsibility.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re concerned about this gang of ruffians you hang out with.
 <br>
 They are my friends.
 <br>
 That&#39;s exactly what they want you to think.
 <br>
 Now, we&#39;re not inflexible.
 <br>
 I mean, we looked the other way when you started wearing cologne.
 <br>
 But now you&#39;ve brought the devil&#39;s music into our home.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 That is not the devil&#39;s music.
 <br>
 It is Eric&#39;s.
 <br>
 Rebecca, show the boy.
 <br>
 Now, listen to what happens when she plays it backwards.
 <br>
 That cannot be good for the record.
 <br>
 There it is! &#34;Devil love me.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Devil lives!&#34; It&#39;s clear as day.
 <br>
 What&#39;s funny? In my language, the record just said: &#34;I want to sex your monkey.
 <br>
 &#34; Which I have never done.
 <br>
 Donna, I was thinking we should go see a movie tonight.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 I&#39;d love to see All the President&#39;s Men.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I actually hear that isn&#39;t very good.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I was thinking maybe The Omen.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that at the drive-in? Is that at the Yeah, no, I guess it is.
 <br>
 - So, do you want to go? - Tonight? Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 When the child was 5 years old something terrible happened.
 <br>
 The truth.
 <br>
 Where does it end? The Omen? That&#39;s at the drive-in.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 I mean, I really like Eric and I&#39;d like to have a physical relationship, but It&#39;s called, &#34;make out,&#34; Donna.
 <br>
 Say it.
 <br>
 All right, make out.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t want it to be public.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want it to be tacky, I don&#39;t want there to be pressure and now it&#39;s this tacky, public pressure make-out thing.
 <br>
 I understand.
 <br>
 Everybody wants their first make-out to be special in some place romantic.
 <br>
 Like Ireland.
 <br>
 Or Disney World.
 <br>
 Disney World? Right, sorry.
 <br>
 So, let&#39;s focus.
 <br>
 He asked you to the drive-in.
 <br>
 Did Donna say yes? And you said &#34;yes&#34;? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes! This is great.
 <br>
 - Me and Jackie will come with you.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Will you come with us? - Why? - Why not? - You&#39;d be like competition.
 <br>
 You&#39;d be like a loophole.
 <br>
 - Competition? - Loophole? I&#39;d have to keep up with you and Jackie.
 <br>
 That would make me nervous.
 <br>
 I could always talk to you if I get nervous.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you&#39;ve got to be bored with sex by now.
 <br>
 What do you mean? - You and Jackie - You and Kelso have done it a million times.
 <br>
 True.
 <br>
 We have never done it.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Slid into home on the second date.
 <br>
 He got to third base once and that was an accident.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be there.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We won&#39;t come.
 <br>
 - Perfect.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 Okay, now, see? This dress says: &#34;Look at me.
 <br>
 Notice me.
 <br>
 Stare at me!&#34; It&#39;s all wrong.
 <br>
 No, you look terrific.
 <br>
 Especially for dinner at the Lion&#39;s Head.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s no good.
 <br>
 What? The Lion&#39;s Head? I thought we were going to Phillies.
 <br>
 I changed my mind.
 <br>
 You never do that.
 <br>
 The Lion&#39;s Head.
 <br>
 It is so fancy.
 <br>
 They make the butter look like little flowers.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s different.
 <br>
 I mean, hell, we haven&#39;t been there in years.
 <br>
 - It&#39;ll be fun.
 <br>
 - This is so exciting! Okay, now, if we are going to go to someplace that fancy I have to shave your neck.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get the clippers, you hop in the tub.
 <br>
 I am telling you, I heard it.
 <br>
 The devil is singing backwards on the record.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not the devil, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Congress.
 <br>
 They passed a secret law to put backward messages in our records, man.
 <br>
 They want to kill rock and roll because they know it makes us horny, man.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t pretty much everything make us horny? Cartoons make me horny.
 <br>
 And food.
 <br>
 When you play the record backwards, you can hear the devil speak.
 <br>
 I am starting to hear him everywhere.
 <br>
 Satan is your master, Fez.
 <br>
 Worship Satan.
 <br>
 Before you worship Satan, get him a cherry pop.
 <br>
 Get Satan a cherry pop.
 <br>
 A pop, man.
 <br>
 Get me a pop.
 <br>
 Fez, man, get me a pop.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I misunderstood.
 <br>
 Satan&#39;s second choice is root beer.
 <br>
 Werner, party of two.
 <br>
 Werner, party of two.
 <br>
 Red? What is this place? Excuse me.
 <br>
 - What happened to the Lion&#39;s Head? - Burned down.
 <br>
 Five dead.
 <br>
 Real sad.
 <br>
 Welcome to Blanigan&#39;s.
 <br>
 May I take your name? I&#39;ll get back to you.
 <br>
 What do you think? It certainly is different.
 <br>
 - It might not be so bad.
 <br>
 - On your left, Sparky.
 <br>
 - The staff is certainly enthusiastic.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m sure I can get us a nice, quiet table.
 <br>
 Happy birthday Happy birthday To you I&#39;ll put our name on the list.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Party of two.
 <br>
 Okey-dokey.
 <br>
 That&#39;ll be about two hours.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s $20.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll have something in about 15 minutes.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t want this place to burn down twice, do you? - All right.
 <br>
 We have something right now.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s what I thought.
 <br>
 Sweetheart, this is our lucky night.
 <br>
 Would you check this? Sure.
 <br>
 Looks real good.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Maybe I should go back to my house and pop some popcorn.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause they always overcharge.
 <br>
 Jackie and Kelso.
 <br>
 What are you guys doing here? Nothing.
 <br>
 What are you guys doing here? Donna and I are going to the drive-in.
 <br>
 Remember? Thank you, Eric, we&#39;d love to go.
 <br>
 Michael, get in the car.
 <br>
 - But I don&#39;t think - Get in the car.
 <br>
 Look, this isn&#39;t what we talked about at all.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take it slow.
 <br>
 Try to keep up.
 <br>
 Going to the drive-in.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Guy, and I&#39;ll be your waiter.
 <br>
 Would either of you like to help yourself to our Blanigan-tastic salad bar? - What&#39;s a salad bar? - It&#39;s right over there.
 <br>
 All the salad fixings.
 <br>
 And you make your own Blanigan-tastic salad.
 <br>
 You mean my wife has to make her own salad? It&#39;ll be worth the trip.
 <br>
 You&#39;re kidding, right? Red.
 <br>
 No, Kitty, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Guy, my wife didn&#39;t get all dressed up for a special night out so that she could make her own salad.
 <br>
 See, she could do that at home.
 <br>
 For free.
 <br>
 But she wouldn&#39;t have eight Blanigan-tastic dressings to choose from at home, would she? Are you being a wiseacre? Red, honey.
 <br>
 Your neck vein.
 <br>
 It&#39;s poking out.
 <br>
 Sir, I can&#39;t bring her a salad.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get in trouble.
 <br>
 What the hell kind of a restaurant is this? You&#39;ve got eight people singing Happy Birthday and nobody can bring my wife a damn salad.
 <br>
 Red, honey.
 <br>
 Neck vein, neck vein, neck vein.
 <br>
 Come on, Kitty, let&#39;s get out of here.
 <br>
 Happy birthday Screw your freaking birthday! Please replace the speaker on its rack when you&#39;re leaving.
 <br>
 Failure to do so will damage both the speaker and your car.
 <br>
 God, this movie even sounds gross.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not the movie.
 <br>
 So You guys okay up here? No, I want popcorn.
 <br>
 I want Eric and Kelso to go get it.
 <br>
 Eric can go get it.
 <br>
 No, Michael.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t bring you here to suck Kelso&#39;s face off.
 <br>
 I know I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 This is so awkward.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 And I wasn&#39;t being a very good friend.
 <br>
 No more making out.
 <br>
 I promise.
 <br>
 All right, about the popcorn I need money.
 <br>
 What? I don&#39;t want popcorn.
 <br>
 Get back in the car.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t know what she wants.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Michael, no.
 <br>
 We are gonna watch the movie with Eric and Donna.
 <br>
 But I missed the beginning.
 <br>
 The little kid&#39;s the devil.
 <br>
 They have to kill him.
 <br>
 Watch the movie.
 <br>
 Look at me, Damien.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all for you! Donna, it&#39;s just a movie.
 <br>
 - Do you wanna sit somewhere else? - So bad.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Here we are.
 <br>
 Back at Phillies.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Good old Phillies.
 <br>
 Good food at a fair price.
 <br>
 You&#39;re ordering the Salisbury steak, aren&#39;t you? Nope.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going for the ham.
 <br>
 Red, don&#39;t put your hat on the counter, it&#39;s all greasy.
 <br>
 Pal, can I get some half-and-half? Isn&#39;t this familiar? Okay, now, here&#39;s how we sneak the devil music past Ozzie and Harriet.
 <br>
 Observe.
 <br>
 Alice Cooper, meet Pat Boone.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t resist me, Pat Boone.
 <br>
 No, you&#39;re hurting me.
 <br>
 - Come on, take it.
 <br>
 - No, it hurts.
 <br>
 - Come on.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 But what if my host parents hear it? Then Satan commands us to kill them, Fez.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll use the headphones.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;m sorry about tonight.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not your fault, Red.
 <br>
 You know how emotional I get when I read Cosmo.
 <br>
 Boy, do I.
 <br>
 You know, okay, at least we gave it a try.
 <br>
 I guess we have slowed down, flattened out.
 <br>
 - At our age, it&#39;s inevitable.
 <br>
 - Okay, that&#39;s it! Red! My lord! You&#39;re not flashing back to Guadalcanal, are you? Hold on, Kitty.
 <br>
 The night&#39;s not over.
 <br>
 You know, the stars are really just Forget it.
 <br>
 What? Nothing.
 <br>
 So Jackie and Kelso certainly made themselves comfortable.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a roomy car.
 <br>
 Yeah, it is.
 <br>
 You know, the bench seat in the Vista Cruiser is the same as what&#39;s in the full-size Pontiac Catalina.
 <br>
 That&#39;s interesting.
 <br>
 Smooth move, Forman! Okay, kids, break it up.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 You&#39;re adults.
 <br>
 Damn right we&#39;re adults.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, sir.
 <br>
 My mistake.
 <br>
 That&#39;s quite all right, we all make mistakes.
 <br>
 Now, why don&#39;t you go bust some pot-smoking teenagers before I give you a good adult-size kick in the ass.
 <br>
 Yes, sir.
 <br>
 Thank you, sir.
 <br>
 Enjoy your evening.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 That was so sweet.
 <br>
 You let him off with a warning.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - But you&#39;re not getting off that easy.
 <br>
 - Red! Raindrops keep falling on my head Just like a guy whose feet are too big for his head This loud music will not damage my hearing? No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s good for you.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 Hey, son.
 <br>
 How was the movie? - It was pretty gory.
 <br>
 - Yeah? How&#39;d it end? I don&#39;t remember.
 <br>
 Thatta boy.
 <br>
 So, how was your night? It was fantastic.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Good night, Dad.
 <br>
 Good night, son.
 <br>
 And, be quiet going upstairs.
 <br>
 Your mother is very tired.
 <br>
 - So, Phillies was fun.
 <br>
 - Yes indeedy.
 <br>
 - Very dependable.
 <br>
 - As always.
 <br>
