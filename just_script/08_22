 Man, the last day of the seventies.
 <br>
 You know, thinking back it&#39;s like one big blur.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome You know Donna, it kinda sucks that you are leaving for college today.
 <br>
 I mean I kinda wanted to ring in the new year by throwing out all your curduroy boy-pants.
 <br>
 Well classes start on Monday and Eric gets back at five so I just wanna like get out of here before all the drama.
 <br>
 Wait a second If you&#39;re actually going, then who is going to be the recipient of Fez&#39; traditional midnight feel-up ? Well I was thinking that Fez&#39;ll be feeling up Jackie.
 <br>
 I mean, she&#39;s his new victim I mean girlfriend.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know Jackie and I haven&#39;t even had our first official kiss yet.
 <br>
 Yeah it&#39;s been a little hard making the transition.
 <br>
 Yeah and I don&#39;t know what to do because now that she is not pushing me away and saying &#34;get off&#34; it&#39;s just awkward.
 <br>
 Wait a second Why are we wasting our time talking about this ? Donna&#39;s leaving town, it&#39;s the end of the decade, we should be doing something awesome man.
 <br>
 Something we have never done before Or this.
 <br>
 That &#39;70s Show - 8x22 - That &#39;70s Finale Wow Wine at eleven-thirty huh ? Did you run out of Bourbon ? Well I am just a complete wreck.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve decided I don&#39;t wanna leave Wisconsin.
 <br>
 D&#39;you tell Red ? Well I I&#39;ve been trying to but, he&#39;s just, he&#39;s so excited about Florida.
 <br>
 Oh, but I&#39;ve been dropping hints, I told him that sunshine makes people whistle because I know how much he wants to punch those people in the face.
 <br>
 Steven ! Here&#39;s a cheque for you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s for all the rent you&#39;ve paid over the years.
 <br>
 I put it into a savings account so you&#39;d have something to get you started.
 <br>
 Wow ! This will buy me a monster bag ofÂ marshmellows Yeah well, you gonna need a place to live now that we&#39;re moving to Florida.
 <br>
 Boy It&#39;s gonna be strange selling the house.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Plenty of warm memoriesÂ You morons just hung vacancy-signs on your asses ! And my foot&#39;s looking for a room ! You know I had to vandalize your ass with my foot Sleep tight and don&#39;t let the bedbugs put their foot in your ass How&#39;d you like to own a little bit of my foot in your ass ? How about I drive my foot into this thing called your ass ? You know we could call in a specialist to find my foot in your ass My foot is about to drill a hole in your ass And you are about to read a book that my foot wrote It&#39;s called &#34;On the road to in your ass&#34;.
 <br>
 Did you ever actually do that with your foot ? Once On Iwo Jima.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t talk about it I love this song.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 It&#39;s perfect for our first real kiss.
 <br>
 What ? Stop it ! You smiled first ! Well I was thinking about tootsie rolls ! Uh Fez, we&#39;re forcing this.
 <br>
 Our first kiss has to be romantic and spontaneous.
 <br>
 And as a guy, it&#39;s your job to completely plan that out.
 <br>
 I hate being the guy.
 <br>
 And not just because of this.
 <br>
 The shoe selection is aweful.
 <br>
 Oh, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman I have here something that might make Red reconsider about moving.
 <br>
 Oh my God ! Packers season tickets ? Red had been on that waiting list for ever ! Yeah my grandfather was on that list for 30 years.
 <br>
 When the tickets finally came he was 90 years old.
 <br>
 He ate them.
 <br>
 How did you get these ? I used the cash that Red gave me.
 <br>
 Oh I would hug you but I know you don&#39;t like that.
 <br>
 Thank you You are such a good boy ! Alright Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, that&#39;s enough.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll say when we&#39;re done Jackie wants our first kiss to happen somewhere romantic.
 <br>
 I wish I could bring her here but this place is ruined &#34;Michael + Jackie&#34; It&#39;s like going out after Sinatra.
 <br>
 Yeah we&#39;ve had some good times up here man.
 <br>
 My favourite thing was watching how people got downÂ This is a dangerous spot ! There you guys are.
 <br>
 KELSO ! Hey man, when did you get back ? Man, c&#39;mon ! I&#39;m not going to spend New Year&#39;s without my friends C&#39;mon ! Besides, it&#39;s, like the turn of the century ! It&#39;s so good to see you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Did you just kiss my ear ? A littleÂ I liked itÂ I&#39;m so psyched, man I got this like four-foot bottle rocket and then I&#39;m gonna like tie it to my arm and light it and just blast into the future ! Hey you guys I just thought of the perfect way to put the seventies to bed.
 <br>
 What do you say the three of us jump of this thing one last time together ? You&#39;re reading my freakin&#39; mind ! Alright you guys ready ? Okay OneÂ twoÂ Wait, wait.
 <br>
 I know how this works You&#39;re gonna say three and I&#39;m gonna be the only one that jumps.
 <br>
 Well if it makes you feel any better, why don&#39;t you do the counting ? That way we all have to jump ! Alright Here we go OneÂ twoÂ three ! AAAAHHHHAAAAHH ! I just can&#39;t wait to see my Eric ! I wonder what he&#39;ll look like ? I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say skinny.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - What the hell man ! I thought you left for school like three hours ago.
 <br>
 I just want to see Eric one last time, you know ? Show him that even though he broke up with me that I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Uh-huh Or maybe it&#39;s cause you still looooove him You are so off.
 <br>
 - Oh he&#39;s here ! - Oh my God, how&#39;s my hair ? Where&#39;s Eric ? The genius missed his flight.
 <br>
 I circled the airport so many times that my finger actually hurts from flipping people off ! This is so typical of Eric.
 <br>
 I let myself get all excited and then he even doesn&#39;t show up.
 <br>
 You know Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman I&#39;m sorry, but your son is an inconsiderate jerk and I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m through with him ! Yeah, things are going great in Chicago.
 <br>
 I even taught my baby daughter how to say &#34;Burn&#34; She doesn&#39;t use it right though.
 <br>
 I get her a lot more than she gets me.
 <br>
 Hey, you&#39;re still doing security at the Playboy-club ? Yeah.
 <br>
 I got promoted to supervisor.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the guy who says : &#34;don&#39;t touch&#34;.
 <br>
 Can you believe that ?! Me ?! Hey speaking of hot chicks, what&#39;s going on with you and that stripper wife of yours ? Hmmm not good, man.
 <br>
 She&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 Apparently she&#39;s not the sweet innocent little girl she pretends to be at the start of her act.
 <br>
 That&#39;s bad news.
 <br>
 I totally would&#39;ve done it with her Man, Hyde, that was right on the bone.
 <br>
 My arm&#39;s all tingly.
 <br>
 Just like your wife would have been if I would have done it with her ! Oww ! Ah I missed thisÂ Remember that time you shot me with a BB gun ? I still have the BB stuck underneath my skin.
 <br>
 I like to play with it sometimes when I get bored.
 <br>
 Just like I would have done with your wifeÂ Awesome my tooth is loose ! Okay Jackie I think I figured out why we haven&#39;t been able to have our first kiss.
 <br>
 We have too much history together.
 <br>
 So I thought that tonight would be romantic if I rewrite some of that history.
 <br>
 Look ! Oh crap ! It was dark This really shouldn&#39;t be this hard.
 <br>
 I just want everybody to know how much I love you.
 <br>
 I always have.
 <br>
 That was really nice.
 <br>
 Yeah you have a really strong tongue.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s from all the talking.
 <br>
 Just when I thought I can&#39;t like Florida any more, they reinstate the death penalty ! Red you are not gonna believe what just came for you My Packer tickets ?! I know ! Isn&#39;t it terrific ? Fifth row.
 <br>
 You can hear the knees blowing out from there ! I can&#39;t believe I have to give them away What ? I know how much you&#39;re looking forward to Florida.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t do that to you.
 <br>
 Red, I don&#39;t wanna move What? Well I was gonna tell you, but ever since we decided to move you you&#39;ve been so happy and smiley and you&#39;re never that way except for when you kill a deer.
 <br>
 Red this is my home.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna leave.
 <br>
 Kitty we don&#39;t have to go anywhere.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care where I live.
 <br>
 As long as I&#39;m with you - Really ? - Of course.
 <br>
 Red - I love you.
 <br>
 - Ohhh I love you too I was talking to the tickets - Hey.
 <br>
 - Oh hey man.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re looking for Forman, he&#39;s still not here.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna see him.
 <br>
 I just wanna get drunk and ring in the New Year with my friends.
 <br>
 Oh Well in that case welcome on board of &#34;Wasted Airlines&#34; Should you experience a loss of buzz, a beer will fall into your hand Please make sure to drink that beer before helping small children with theirs.
 <br>
 Everybody we have an announcement we&#39;ve decided not to sell the house.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going to stay in Point Place.
 <br>
 Hey, that&#39;s so weird, man.
 <br>
 I was just thinkin&#39; of movin&#39; to Point Place ! Well I am just I am just so happy we&#39;re staying because I would miss you so.
 <br>
 Like Fez the way you and I have tea and make fun of male ice-skaters And Jackie you&#39;re such a doll.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even mind your bad-handed compliments.
 <br>
 Ohhh Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you&#39;re my favourite old lady ! Oh, and you too Leo You always make my day when you wave and smile hello.
 <br>
 Even when you are urinating on my mailbox Oh, and Bob No matter what I cook, you can&#39;t pass it up.
 <br>
 Kinda like you can&#39;t pass up a woman&#39;s rear end without yelling &#34;Whoohoo&#34; ! Just being polite.
 <br>
 And Steven My second son I adore you But you know uhm now that we&#39;re staying maybe you could shave your mustache, because, Honey you look like a forty-year old male prostitute.
 <br>
 And Donna, sweetheart No matter where you go I will always love you like a daughter.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry things didn&#39;t work out with you and Eric.
 <br>
 Uhm I think I need some air So speaking of daughters has anyone seen Laurie ? Now listen Bob, uh I know that you were counting on me for the bait shop and all Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a big boy I can make it on my own I&#39;m gonna miss you so much ! Wow, you&#39;re getting really good at this kissing thing It&#39;s magical I couldn&#39;t ask for anything else.
 <br>
 So when do we get to second base ? Oh Mr.

 <br>
 And that my friends, is the last foot-in-ass of the decade ! Cheers ! Michael, I just it&#39;s so good to see you.
 <br>
 The girls in the emergency room were just asking about you.
 <br>

 <br>
 It&#39;s just Donna, I thought about you every day.
 <br>

 <br>
 I have kissed Jacqueline Burkhart ! Yeah Fez.
 <br>
 I have some incredible news too So has everyone else ! I think it makes total sense that Fez ended up with Jackie.
 <br>
 She started out with me, the Ferrari And then she went to Hyde, the Mustang And now she&#39;s with Fez, who&#39;s like a donkey pulling a cart full of brightly colored Mexican blankets ! Oh hey Kelso, I almost forgot I got you something from Africa for your daughter.
 <br>

 <br>
 A genuine plastic rhino-horn.
 <br>
 Awesome ! Look guys, I&#39;m a rhino ! Guys, I think it&#39;s time we honor all the braincells that survived the seventies.
 <br>
 Despite our best efforts some of those bastards pulled through.
 <br>
 Tonight, they&#39;re going down Die braincells, die ! And you&#39;re next liver Hey did you guys hear about that car that runs on water ? It&#39;s got a fiberglass aircooled engine and it runs on water, man ! It&#39;s like we never run out of things to talk about down here I knew you burnouts were down here.
 <br>
 You guys, it&#39;s almost midnight.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman is pouring the champagne.
 <br>
