<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Okay, Fez, now remember.
 <br>
 The bra wants to come off.
 <br>
 It can&#39;t be forced.
 <br>
 It has to be coaxed.
 <br>
 And go.
 <br>
 And they are out! Eight seconds! That&#39;s a new foreign exchange student record! - And I think she liked it.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 That was good, but remember, the real girl will have a head and, hopefully, arms.
 <br>
 Hey, guys! Have I got a surprise for me.
 <br>
 Annette! ( Chuckles ) Yeah.
 <br>
 Annette came all the way from California to visit me because we&#39;re in love.
 <br>
 Yeah, since Hyde stole my old girlfriend-That&#39;s him.
 <br>
 Then I remembered Annette, and, well, I gave her a call.
 <br>
 One thing led to anoth- Well, hello there.
 <br>
 So, Annette, when you get bored with this one I can take off a bra in eight seconds.
 <br>
 Well, maybe more if you fight me.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Back off, Fez.
 <br>
 What me and Annette have is real.
 <br>
 Which is amazing because I even told him that I used to be flat-chested and have a different nose.
 <br>
 Yeah, and I figured she looks okay now, so what the hell? So, anyway.
 <br>
 Annette, you&#39;ll be staying with Donna.
 <br>
 Um, what? No, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be fun.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be like having a giant Barbie to play with.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, come on, Donna.
 <br>
 You guys were great friends in California.
 <br>
 Friends? The most I ever said to her was &#39;&#39;Yeah, those probably do hurt when they&#39;re sunburned.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Well, I need someplace to stash her.
 <br>
 Yeah, I got a footlocker in my room.
 <br>
 Please, Donna.
 <br>
 I already had to take a shower at Michael&#39;s house and one of his brothers took a picture of me.
 <br>
 Kelso, I thought all your brothers were out of the house.
 <br>
 Uh must&#39;ve been a burglar.
 <br>
 ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) So, that&#39;s the tramp Michael fooled around with in California.
 <br>
 The nerve of him bringing her into The Hub.
 <br>
 I mean, people eat here.
 <br>
 Hey, will you stop talking about how jealous you are of Kelso&#39;s new chick? Oh, I am not jealous but I would like to point out that the sign on the door says, &#39;&#39;No dogs allowed.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Donna, can we go to your house? I have to change into my afternoon outfit- gauchos and clogs.
 <br>
 Bravo.
 <br>
 Um, you have an afternoon outfit? Of course she does.
 <br>
 You can maybe use a little freshening up too, Big D.
 <br>
 - Eric, do you mind? - I&#39;m on it.
 <br>
 Ow! - Donna! - Why don&#39;t I meet you guys by the car? Come on, Michael.
 <br>
 While we&#39;re waiting, I&#39;ll let you smell my hair.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I just got these fries.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll go flirt with the gas-station guy.
 <br>
 Fine! God.
 <br>
 How hot was that? Wow.
 <br>
 You know when you have a dirty dream? Well, Annette is the girl who&#39;s always in it.
 <br>
 Oh, she should be ashamed of what she has done to me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t mind her in California but now that she&#39;s got her hooks in Kelso, something&#39;s different.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Something evil.
 <br>
 I just can&#39;t put my finger on it.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;m waiting! I was getting you a SuperBall.
 <br>
 Damn! I told you, I don&#39;t like presents that bounce.
 <br>
 Did you hear that? The shrill voice.
 <br>
 The bossy tone.
 <br>
 The random hatred of all things that bounce.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 She&#39;s Jackie.
 <br>
 - A new Jackie.
 <br>
 - A blondeJackie.
 <br>
 ( Together) &#39;&#39;Blackie.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; We are doomed.
 <br>
 Well, I can&#39;t spend the night alone with that.
 <br>
 Jackie, you have to sleep in my house.
 <br>
 Ooh! Good idea.
 <br>
 Put both Jackies in the same room.
 <br>
 Toss some lipstick in the middle watch &#39;em tear each other to shreds.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna sleep over.
 <br>
 - Well, I don&#39;t like her.
 <br>
 - Come on.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll do, like, girlie things.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be like a pajama party with makeovers.
 <br>
 Donna, I&#39;m not interested in stupid girlie things.
 <br>
 - Look, I&#39;m not shallow anymore.
 <br>
 - ( Coughing ) Don&#39;t do that when I&#39;m eating.
 <br>
 Jackie, come on.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll have all night to chip away at her self-esteem.
 <br>
 We can whisper about her and when she asks us what we were talking about we can giggle and say, &#39;&#39;Nothing.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, wait.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done that to you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where I got it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s what I think would teach her a good lesson.
 <br>
 Dress her up like a Swiss mountain girl, us fellas will come over make a couple of daiquiris, get a little tipsy, see what happens.
 <br>
 What? Okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not a very good punishment.
 <br>
 We should spank her too.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t hear any kids.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re at The Hub.
 <br>
 So, we have the house to ourselves.
 <br>
 Interesting.
 <br>
 ( Doorbell Rings ) Don&#39;t open it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll throw in a foot massage.
 <br>
 It could be The Franklin Mint.
 <br>
 I ordered those Gone With the Wind plates.
 <br>
 Mom, Daddy.
 <br>
 I told you not to open it.
 <br>
 - What are you doing here? - We just thought we&#39;d drop by.
 <br>
 You came all the way from Phoenix just to drop by.
 <br>
 Oh! So you&#39;re lost and you need directions back home.
 <br>
 That&#39;s no problem.
 <br>
 Go south until you see cactus.
 <br>
 If you hit a guy with a sombrero, you&#39;ve gone too far.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 - Why are you really here? - Well, we had a reversal of fortune.
 <br>
 - Tell them what happened.
 <br>
 - I bought an ostrich farm.
 <br>
 Tell them what else happened.
 <br>
 It was next to a coyote farm.
 <br>
 Great story.
 <br>
 See you at Christmas.
 <br>
 He lost all our money.
 <br>
 We had to sell the house in Phoenix, which is why we&#39;re here.
 <br>
 An ostrich farm, Burt? Who the hell wants to eat an ostrich? Coyotes, apparently.
 <br>
 You see what I live with? Well, I&#39;m sure Daddy was just doing what he thought was best.
 <br>
 - You could show him some sympathy.
 <br>
 - Him? What about me? ( Sighs ) It&#39;s always difficult for the beautiful women.
 <br>
 You never understood that, Kitty.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s acting really strange, man.
 <br>
 I think she doesn&#39;t like Kelso having a new chick.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s acting strange, becauseJackie hates Annette becauseJackie and Annette are the same person.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s scary, &#39;cause there can only be one devil, one Hitler, one Darth Vader.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not it.
 <br>
 Something&#39;s going on, and I don&#39;t like it.
 <br>
 Like, you think, maybe she still has feelings for Kelso? I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s bad, man.
 <br>
 I got the same feeling I get right before I shoplift something.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s an old story.
 <br>
 Orphan boy falls for rich girl.
 <br>
 Doofus shows up with whore.
 <br>
 Rich girl goes back to doofus.
 <br>
 Fez consoles whore, sexually.
 <br>
 And orphan boy ends up alone, slowly going blind from self-abuse.
 <br>
 Too far? I had a feeling it was too far.
 <br>
 What are you guys doin&#39; sitting here when the girls are having a pajama party right next door? Oh, I can just imagine what&#39;s going on over there.
 <br>
 No, no, Fez.
 <br>
 I got this one.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s have a pillow fight- Even though it&#39;s hard to do when I&#39;m encumbered by all these clothes.
 <br>
 Jackie! Take off my nightie.
 <br>
 Not yet.
 <br>
 I wanna practice kissing.
 <br>
 Just kissing? Or can we rub up against each other too? Well, Annette, you can&#39;t have one without the other.
 <br>
 ( All ) Yea! Yea.
 <br>
 You know, it occurs to me that you can see right into Donna&#39;s house from my driveway.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t say? I&#39;m gonna go get some CrackerJacks.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) She&#39;s so cheap, she could be the prize in the CrackerJacks.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You&#39;re jealous.
 <br>
 I am not jealous.
 <br>
 I just wanna pop that inflatable bitch and watch her fly around the room.
 <br>
 Look, here&#39;s the thing,Jackie.
 <br>
 Kelso likes bossy, vain, shallow princess types and since you&#39;re no longer available, he shipped one in from out West.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not supposed to replace me.
 <br>
 He&#39;s supposed to sit around and pine for me.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! It is always about food with you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like you&#39;re not even listening.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 New rule for slumber parties: Annette wears a robe.
 <br>
 No, Annette, not the robe.
 <br>
 Quick.
 <br>
 Somebody yell, &#39;&#39;Pillow fight,&#39;&#39; in a girl voice.
 <br>
 - Forman, that&#39;s your cue.
 <br>
 - What are you boys lookin&#39; at? - We&#39;re just testin&#39; out the crates.
 <br>
 - For charity.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 But now that we&#39;re done, let&#39;s head inside, gang.
 <br>
 - You coming? - No, I told your grandmother I was comin&#39; outside for a cigarette.
 <br>
 - Grandpa, you smoke? - Nope.
 <br>
 So, um- So- So did you guys hear about that woman who might be the first female member of the Supreme Court? No.
 <br>
 I did hear the Dallas Cowboys might hire their first redheaded cheerleader.
 <br>
 Ew! That&#39;s exactly what I said.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Redhead in the room.
 <br>
 - ( Whispering ) - ( Giggling ) - What are you guys talking about? - ( Together) Nothing.
 <br>
 - Burt! Burtikins! - ( TV:Sports Crowd Cheering ) ( Shouts ) Burt! Eric, would you please go find your grandfather before my head explodes.
 <br>
 You are all such nice boys.
 <br>
 I have a quarter for each one of you.
 <br>
 ( All ) Thanks, Grandma B.
 <br>
 - Someone call an ambulance.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s wrong? Grandpa&#39;s on the ground.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not moving.
 <br>
 They got ice cream in the cafeteria! Ice cream? Kelso, my grandpa&#39;s in intensive care.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I told &#39;em it was my grandfather so I got the ice cream for free.
 <br>
 - Put it down.
 <br>
 - Fine but when my burrito&#39;s ready, I&#39;m eatin&#39; it.
 <br>
 Why does everybody go everywhere with us? Look at all these damn kids.
 <br>
 I feel like a Mormon.
 <br>
 Man.
 <br>
 I feel like we should know something by now.
 <br>
 That is the third coffee break that doctor&#39;s had.
 <br>
 Hey, buddy! Quit the coffee, fix the sickies, all right? Hey, who took my ice cream? Oh, sure.
 <br>
 It&#39;s always the foreign guy.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re holding the spoon.
 <br>
 Oh, sure.
 <br>
 It&#39;s always the foreign guy with the spoon.
 <br>
 Kitty, how&#39;s Burt? Well I don&#39;t know how to say this.
 <br>
 Daddy&#39;s gone to a better place.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause this hospital sucks.
 <br>
 What? Oh.
 <br>
 ( Whispers ) This hospital sucks.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.
 <br>
 The service was lovely.
 <br>
 Aw, geez.
 <br>
 Aw, geez.
 <br>
 - Aw- - We got it, Bob.
 <br>
 Mom, how you doin&#39;? - Oh, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 - Mom.
 <br>
 Your husband, my father, is gone.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not fine.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I think I chipped a tooth on your manicotti.
 <br>
 When I die, get a caterer.
 <br>
 Hey, man.
 <br>
 Sorry about your grandpa.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know him, but there&#39;s a Carly Simon song that always cheers me up.
 <br>
 - ( Clears Throat ) - No, you don&#39;t- ( Singing Ballad ) - Oh, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 -  ( Ends ) What do I do? Do I clap? I&#39;m just gonna walk away.
 <br>
 That was awesome.
 <br>
 Do you know &#39;&#39;Devil Went Down To Georgia&#39;&#39;? No, Michael.
 <br>
 She&#39;s got better things to do.
 <br>
 Hey, come on! Let&#39;s go try on people&#39;s coats.
 <br>
 So, the rich girl goes off with the whore.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a happy ending.
 <br>
 Put it on ice and you got yourself a show.
 <br>
 Yeah, soJackie and Annette are friends now? I guess I don&#39;t have anything to worry about.
 <br>
 Never count Kelso out.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got a way about him.
 <br>
 You know, when he talks to you, it&#39;s like you&#39;re the only one in the room.
 <br>
 You&#39;re, like, half in love with him, aren&#39;t you? Hey, Eric.
 <br>
 I brought you half a beer.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s mixed with half a Coke, &#39;cause Red caught me.
 <br>
 - So, are you okay? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I guess.
 <br>
 - Hey, thanks for coming.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m really sorry about your grandfather.
 <br>
 I mean, right in your own driveway.
 <br>
 What was he doing out there anyway? He caught us spying on your slumber party.
 <br>
 You were spying on us? Eric! We- Okay.
 <br>
 If anyone should be mad, it should be us because, lady, you do not know how to throw a slumber party.
 <br>
 Flannel pajamas? What are you, a hundred? You need a nightie? I&#39;ll buy you a nightie.
 <br>
 So, am I allowed to drink around you guys yet? Eric, put that back.
 <br>
 That&#39;s your mother&#39;s emergency wine.
 <br>
 So, um, Mom, you haven&#39;t said much.
 <br>
 Are you holding it in? &#39;Cause it&#39;s okay to let it out.
 <br>
 We&#39;re family.
 <br>
 If anybody needs to let anything out, I&#39;d be happy to leave.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just so typical of Burt to make everyone come up from Phoenix in the middle of winter.
 <br>
 He never thought about anybody but himself and those damned ostriches.
 <br>
 Did you hear that? That is not grieving.
 <br>
 Okay, Kitty.
 <br>
 Calm down.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not as bad as you think.
 <br>
 Maybe you&#39;re just having a hot flash.
 <br>
 Oh! Dad, no.
 <br>
 Eric I need you to get to the wine.
 <br>
 Father&#39;s thoughtless.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell her who&#39;s thoughtless.
 <br>
 What is it? I, um,just wanted to see if you wanted another blanket.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 That would be very nice.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Hey, Mom.
 <br>
 Dad wanted me to give you this.
 <br>
 Donna, great news.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not jealous of Annette.
 <br>
 I thought I was, and I was afraid that I might still have feelings for Michael.
 <br>
 But I got to know her and now I really like her.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) That is such a relief because, you know what with Burt dying, I was worried about you.
 <br>
 - Yeah, me too.
 <br>
 - That was sarcasm.
 <br>
 Well, whatever it was, it was very thoughtful.
 <br>
 It is such a relief knowing I don&#39;t have feelings for Michael.
 <br>
 Get off my boyfriend! Oh, yeah! I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s so upset.
 <br>
 I was barely touching you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 This one&#39;s for Burt.
 <br>
 And a-one and a-two and a- -  ( Organ ) -  ( Singing Spiritual ) Bring it home, brother! - ( Ends ) -  ( Organ Clicks Off) Night-night.
