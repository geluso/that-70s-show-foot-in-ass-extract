<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 hey, fez, you know what was awesome? That time you rode that tree.
 <br>
 How did he ride a tree? Oh, he climbed it, kelso cut it down.
 <br>
 You guys have a million stories and you know each other so well.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like you have your own language.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even understand half the things you say.
 <br>
 If you understand anything that fez says, you&#39;re the only one.
 <br>
 Burn! Oh, kelso can&#39;t understand me? Now I know how it feels to be a book.
 <br>
 Ah-burn! See? Man, I wanna burn somebody so I can be part of the gang.
 <br>
 This gang? Angie, the only reason this gang formed was because no one would let us into their gang.
 <br>
 We&#39;re like the chess club, but better looking and dumber.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Um, so was there somethin&#39; you wanted to say to me the other day at the record store? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I wanted to talk to you about Abba.
 <br>
 Abba? No, you said you wanted to talk about us.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Our feelings about abba.
 <br>
 You know what? Good.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Believe me, I don&#39;t wanna talk about us, either.
 <br>
 Come on, angie.
 <br>
 We were supposed to open the record store, oh, about seven hours ago.
 <br>
 You told me you wanted to tell hyde that you still love him and you wanted him back.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, it&#39;s obvious he doesn&#39;t want me back.
 <br>
 So you better not tell him what I said, or I&#39;ll be humiliated.
 <br>
 My lips are a seal&#39;s.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you mean that your lips are sealed? I&#39;m not hearing the difference.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Anyways, you guys, I have huge news.
 <br>
 You know how point place cable has that public access channel? Yeah! Donna, didn&#39;t your dad do, like, a belly dancing show there? He guest-hosted.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Anyways, I&#39;m gonna have my own show! Just like mary tyler moore.
 <br>
 Oh, except I won&#39;t stop for commercials &#39;cause no one really wants to take a break from me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 That week you were in florida-- that was a nice, quiet week.
 <br>
 Have you been in bed all day? Yeah, I have.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been reading the jack kerouac classic &#34;on the road.
 <br>
 &#34; See, as I see it, why get out of bed when you can read about people who got outta bed? You have got to be the laziest non-communist I&#39;ve ever met.
 <br>
 And you are about to read a book that my foot wrote.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called &#34;on the road to in your ass.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay, now, red, please, let&#39;s hold off on the cursing until happy hour.
 <br>
 This year-off crap better come to an end or I&#39;m gonna put you in a box and mail ya to the marines.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t worry, honey.
 <br>
 Your father&#39;s too cheap to mail something that heavy.
 <br>
 He just wants you to have some direction, and so do I.
 <br>
 And you are in luck because I got the new issue of &#34;cosmo.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m just not sure I need seven new ways to please my man.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Honey, it&#39;s a job aptitude test.
 <br>
 Okay, question number one-- &#34;do you consider yourself creative?&#34; - Well-- - yes! You were a little wiz at macaroni art.
 <br>
 &#34;Do you prefer to work alone or with others?&#34; - Alone.
 <br>
 - Nope.
 <br>
 You love people.
 <br>
 Okay, question three -- &#34;do you&#34; well, that&#39;s easy.
 <br>
 Look, mom, I&#39;m happy just enjoying my world.
 <br>
 I&#39;m like an explorer I&#39;m exactly like christopher columbus, except, you know, I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been incredibly distracted by television.
 <br>
 Okay! All done.
 <br>
 Now, according to your answers you should be a nurse! That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 16 &#34;On with The Show&#34; okay, fez, since you&#39;re helping me with set dressing, I want the set to reflect my sparkling personality.
 <br>
 I want it to say &#34;jackie.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay, let me see.
 <br>
 Maybe some glitter, a disco ball uh-huh.
 <br>
 I want a big sign that says &#34;jackie.
 <br>
 &#34; I hate this room.
 <br>
 It reminds me of my dad dancing around half-naked with finger cymbals.
 <br>
 Well, my show is gonna be a news show all-nude or just topless? Not nude-- news! I&#39;m not hearing the difference.
 <br>
 Jackie, how are you gonna tell people the news if you don&#39;t know any news? I know all the news that&#39;s really important, like who&#39;s got a new car, what store is having a sale on leggings and, uh, and if there&#39;ll ever be peace in the middle-east.
 <br>
 who am I kidding? No one cares about China.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric, can I have some of your fries? Sure.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t want any.
 <br>
 Burn! I think you&#39;re confusing a burn with just talking.
 <br>
 Eric, can I have some fries? yeah, help yourself.
 <br>
 Burn! Yeah, um, I knew you were gonna do that so I spit in &#39;em.
 <br>
 Burn! Totally.
 <br>
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! You ate his spit! Burn! Uh, that&#39;s a piggyback burn.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 Come on Angie.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve gotta do inventory in the store room and I gotta go sleep behind a box.
 <br>
 Man, you want to, uh, catch a movie or something? Nah.
 <br>
 I gotta go down to the police academy.
 <br>
 They&#39;re gonna teach me what prisoners feel like.
 <br>
 Guys are gonna handcuff me to a flagpole for a few hours.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not in the curriculum, but they say it&#39;s required.
 <br>
 Hey, uh I&#39;m sorry, are you reading the new &#34;mighty spectaculus&#34;? Yeah.
 <br>
 You a fan? When trouble arrives by car or bus, we summon - The mighty spectaculus! - The mighty spectaculus! They call me eric forman.

 Stew bailey.
 <br>
 No relation to beetle.
 <br>
 Hey, Stew, I mean, if you&#39;re interested, they&#39;re havin&#39;a spectaculus spectacular down at the atomic comic book nook.
 <br>
 You&#39;re probably-- You probably have to get back to work or something.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have to be anywhere.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have a job.
 <br>
 How old are you? Well, let&#39;s just say I&#39;m two years older than professor Reveng-O.
 <br>
 S-so then, Stew, what do you do all day? You&#39;re lookin&#39; at it.
 <br>
 Oh, we&#39;re gonna be good friends.
 <br>
 Fez, jackie&#39;s show is about to start.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t you supposed to be helping her? She asked me to make a giant sign with her name on it, so I said, &#34;you got it Baby!&#34; so then I went to get some ice cream and then I went to play some space invaders and, um, and then I came here to watch the show.
 <br>
 I could never be on tv, unless it was johnny carson Because I have a very funny story about a cheeto that looked just like jesus.
 <br>
 So, Fez you&#39;ve been hanging out a lot lately with jackie.
 <br>
 Any idea what she wanted to talk to me about at the record store the other day? Um, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I was there.
 <br>
 I mean, I-i wasn&#39;t there.
 <br>
 I, uh I was, uh, I was away on business.
 <br>
 Well, if she wanted to get back together, that&#39;s something I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing.
 <br>
 So why don&#39;t you just go ahead and spill the beans? Beans? What beans? The only beans are in your head, You little bean-head! Anyway.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I opened the bag, and there he was-- the beard and everything.
 <br>
 Oh, Oh! Jackie&#39;s about to start.
 <br>
 Okay, jackie, are you ready? Yeah, of course.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got this thing&#39;s down path.
 <br>
 Okay, so after the weather report, I&#39;m gonna get into the problem with the spirit squad.
 <br>
 They&#39;re all fat.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my commentary.
 <br>
 I&#39;m anti-fat.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Ten seconds until you&#39;re on the air, offending thousands of people.
 <br>
 Thousands of people? In 5 4 3 You didn&#39;t say 2 or 1.
 <br>
 It&#39;s because you&#39;re on now! Well, but I&#39;m not hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Backie Jurkhart.
 <br>
 Jackie burkhart! - What? - It&#39;s your name! - I know what my name - you said backie jurkhart.
 <br>
 Okay, stop talking or you&#39;re fired! Fine.
 <br>
 You&#39;re on your own.
 <br>
 I&#39;m what? Oh dear she&#39;s not so good.
 <br>
 She&#39;s sweatin&#39; like muhammed Ali cut to her boobs.
 <br>
 Oh, who&#39;s directing this thing? well, guess we can&#39;t just sit and talk about comic books all day.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do some&#34;star wars&#34; trivia.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 Oh, I got a stumper.
 <br>
 Who is luke and obi-wan&#39;s nemesis at-- doctor Evazan.
 <br>
 Man, you&#39;re good.
 <br>
 look, let me ask you a question.
 <br>
 Some people think that if I keep living, you know, &#34;without a purpose&#34; that I&#39;ll be all, I don&#39;t know, unfulfilled and stuff.
 <br>
 Do you ever feel unfulfilled? I&#39;ve seen &#34;star wars&#34; in seven different states.
 <br>
 I even met the midget that they stuck inside r2-d2.
 <br>
 What could be more fulfilling than that? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Hey, dorks.
 <br>
 Listen, uh, angie had a really rough day at work, so I&#39;m gonna rub her feet and you might wanna clear out before I start rubbin&#39; other stuff.
 <br>
 Eric, come over later.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll game.
 <br>
 Who was that guy? That&#39;s this guy St-- I don&#39;t care! Burn! Angie, you&#39;re cute as a button, but you burn like a botard.
 <br>
 Look, if you wanna burn someone, you gotta embarrass them to make other people laugh.
 <br>
 You want to combine the elements of humiliation and surprise.
 <br>
 Dude, what the hell? Burn! Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Jackie, uh, I saw your show.
 <br>
 It isn&#39;t as good as a lot of other shows.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 It was great for people who think regular tv is too entertaining.
 <br>
 I freaked out.
 <br>
 I mean, the cameras turned on and I realized I&#39;m completely alone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m alone on tv and I&#39;m alone in real life.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do.
 <br>
 Burn! Oh, my god! Uh uh, I forgot to tell you the part about you don&#39;t burn someone who&#39;s already crying.
 <br>
 Okay, best side kick-- Robin or Aqualad? Ooh.
 <br>
 Uh, toughie.
 <br>
 Is the villain they&#39;re fighting terrestrial or Aquatic? Stewie, you didn&#39;t tell me you were having a friend over.
 <br>
 Eric, this is my mom.
 <br>
 Y-you still live with your mom? Oh, she&#39;s more than just my mother.
 <br>
 She&#39;s my best friend.
 <br>
 She&#39;s your best friend?! Well, you&#39;re givin&#39; her a run for her money.
 <br>
 Okay, I gotta go.
 <br>
 Are you sure? I was about to make sandwiches in the shape of x-wing fighters.
 <br>
 Uh, no, really.
 <br>
 Well-- no, I gotta go.
 <br>
 What are you doin&#39;? I&#39;m throwin&#39; out all my comic books.
 <br>
 I saw my future today and well, it&#39;s living with its mother.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I saw my future and it sweats.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Hold on.
 <br>
 You sweat? Uh, would you happen to have a picture, some tape of this that I could laugh at? Eric, I tried to have my own tv show, and I failed.
 <br>
 My life is over.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not good enough to be on tv.
 <br>
 No, jackie okay, come on.
 <br>
 You&#39;re good-looking, you&#39;re incredibly superficial and you lie constantly.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;re perfect for tv.
 <br>
 Do you really think so? Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean jeez, look, at least you&#39;re doing something with your life.
 <br>
 I have wasted an entire year.
 <br>
 Eric, let me stop you right there, okay? Since you were kind enough to cheer me up when my spirits were low, I&#39;m gonna go.
 <br>
 Thanks! Hey, forman, let me ask you a question.
 <br>
 What do you think about me and jackie? Well, man, you know what I think.
 <br>
 I think that jackie is evil incarnate.
 <br>
 I think that if you were to cut off one of her hands, it would probably grow back into another jackie.
 <br>
 Look, before jackie, you were just some pissed-off guy in my basement.
 <br>
 But with her I mean, you seemed happy, man.
 <br>
 Hey, I was never happy.
 <br>
 I was just less pissed off.
 <br>
 Hyde I lied to you when I told you that I was away on business.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 yes.
 <br>
 And I know what jackie wanted to tell you.
 <br>
 She still loves you.
 <br>
 What? Yeah.
 <br>
 She said she was wrong and that she wanted you back.
 <br>
 She was vulnerable, so I tried to french her.
 <br>
 But no-go.
 <br>
 Shouldn&#39;t jackie be here by now? Yeah.
 <br>
 She&#39;s supposed to go on in, like, a minute.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think she&#39;s gonna show up.
 <br>
 What? No! But we were gonna do this whole segment on sluts.
 <br>
 And I was gonna be the slut expert.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the only kind of expert I&#39;m ever gonna be! Hey.
 <br>
 Jackie, I can&#39;t believe you showed up.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe i showed up.
 <br>
 What am I doing with my life? Okay, come on, people.
 <br>
 We got a show to do.
 <br>
