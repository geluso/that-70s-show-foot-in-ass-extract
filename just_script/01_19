 My first prom tux.
 <br>
 Come on, guys, dig the crushed velvet.
 <br>
 Eric, you look like a pimp.
 <br>
 You know, Forman prom night could be a very special night for you and Donna.
 <br>
 Hyde, this could be the biggest night of our lives.
 <br>
 - I mean, Donna and I could go - To the prom.
 <br>
 - No, Fez.
 <br>
 All the way.
 <br>
 - All the way to the prom.
 <br>
 You know what you should do? You should rent a motel room.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s spontaneous.
 <br>
 What? Look, if this night is as big as I think, I want it to be very, very special.
 <br>
 Because this is gonna be the first time for both of us.
 <br>
 You silly virgins.
 <br>
 Anyway, this is how I picture it.
 <br>
 Well, here we are walking on the beach.
 <br>
 And now we&#39;re gonna do it.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it spontaneous? Exactly.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what got me.
 <br>
 That was nice.
 <br>
 But if I plan it out, it won&#39;t be nice.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be - Good evening.
 <br>
 - Did you bring the forms? Yes, I did.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s the guarantee of foreplay.
 <br>
 Signed, initialed, notarized.
 <br>
 Very well.
 <br>
 As you know, I&#39;m on the pill so here is your copy of the prophylactic waiver.
 <br>
 It looks like we have a deal here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking forward to consummation.
 <br>
 - Excellent.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Forman, if you don&#39;t get a motel, it&#39;s gonna be more like this.
 <br>
 You&#39;re home already? It&#39;s not even Kitty, he&#39;s home already.
 <br>
 Already? Eric, you&#39;re just such a loser.
 <br>
 He is, isn&#39;t he? Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Are you ready to rock and roll? Kitty, I am so mad at Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;m trying to improve myself, and he won&#39;t let me.
 <br>
 Plus, he says my ideas are stupid.
 <br>
 Now that&#39;s the pot calling the kettle black, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ll say.
 <br>
 What? Good coffee.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m sorry, Midge.
 <br>
 But I really have to get to work.
 <br>
 Gosh, darn it, I want a job.
 <br>
 You know, Midge, having a job is not all it&#39;s cracked up to be.
 <br>
 Working at the hospital is very hard work.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t want one of those jobs.
 <br>
 I want a fun job.
 <br>
 Okay, even with a fun job, you still You have to deal with your boss.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get a job as a boss.
 <br>
 Now, that is a sharp plan, Midge.
 <br>
 You just You let me know how that goes.
 <br>
 Okay, guys.
 <br>
 Guess who&#39;s taking Pam Macy to the prom? Anyone with a quarter? Me.
 <br>
 Damn, and I had a quarter.
 <br>
 - Kelso, you&#39;re not taking Jackie? - No way, man.
 <br>
 Jackie dumped me.
 <br>
 - I can take Jackie.
 <br>
 - Yeah, do it, Fez, and I&#39;ll kick your ass.
 <br>
 Well, well, well.
 <br>
 Look who suddenly cares.
 <br>
 Why did you hit me? That was sarcasm.
 <br>
 You know, you guys are making me sick with all your prom talk.
 <br>
 Proms are stupid.
 <br>
 What would you know? You&#39;ve never even been to one.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t been to the dentist, either, but I don&#39;t need to go to know it&#39;s lame.
 <br>
 I know who I can ask to the prom.
 <br>
 Oh, boy, who, Fez? The lucky lady is my English teacher.
 <br>
 Fez, you can&#39;t take a teacher to the prom.
 <br>
 Why not? She&#39;s always writing sexy comments on my homework.
 <br>
 See.
 <br>
 &#34;Nice job.
 <br>
 Good effort.
 <br>
 &#34;See me.
 <br>
 &#34;I love you.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay, I made the last one up but the other ones were real.
 <br>
 These are the shoes I&#39;m wearing to the prom.
 <br>
 - Aren&#39;t they cool? - My God.
 <br>
 I was gonna get new shoes except Michael didn&#39;t ask me.
 <br>
 And you like my prom dress, right? My God.
 <br>
 I was gonna get a new prom dress except Michael didn&#39;t ask me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so nervous about the prom.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s gonna be the night that Eric and I You know? My gosh, that&#39;s when Michael and I were going to do it for the first time.
 <br>
 Jackie, you and Kelso did it, like, two months ago.
 <br>
 And, like, 30 times after that.
 <br>
 Yeah, but it would have been our first time at a prom.
 <br>
 Except Michael didn&#39;t ask me.
 <br>
 Jackie, you broke up with him.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it sad? - Look, just ask Kelso to go with you.
 <br>
 - God, no.
 <br>
 This is the prom.
 <br>
 This is no time for your stupid feminist crap.
 <br>
 Hello, Michael.
 <br>
 Hello, Jackie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just over here helping Donna get ready for the prom.
 <br>
 Because Eric and Donna are going to the prom.
 <br>
 Yes, we are.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to the prom.
 <br>
 I&#39;m taking Pam Macy.
 <br>
 Oh, the thing.
 <br>
 I have a date, too.
 <br>
 Who is it? What&#39;s his name? His name is not important.
 <br>
 What&#39;s important is, he&#39;s better than you in every conceivable way.
 <br>
 Damn, Jackie, that could be anybody! Jackie if I asked you what&#39;s wrong, will you stop doing that? It&#39;s the prom.
 <br>
 Stupid Michael&#39;s taking stupid Pam Macy.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t have a date, but I told him I did, and I&#39;m a complete loser.
 <br>
 No, you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that, like, I thought he was gonna ask me and now everyone who&#39;s anyone is already going.
 <br>
 That is so true.
 <br>
 How would you know? You&#39;re not even going.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not even going.
 <br>
 And I bet you clean up real good.
 <br>
 Well, I do, but I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 See, that&#39;s a big part of who I am.
 <br>
 Look, I know we&#39;ve had our differences, but Jackie, we&#39;ve had nothing but differences.
 <br>
 In fact, don&#39;t we kind of hate each other? Yes, but this is the prom.
 <br>
 Jackie, stop.
 <br>
 Stop crying.
 <br>
 Stop it.
 <br>
 - Look, do you want to go to the prom? - Yes.
 <br>
 The gym looks like Well, the gym with streamers.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, this is just gonna be an incredible night.
 <br>
 Really incredible.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 What do you mean? What do you mean? - Nothing.
 <br>
 - Okay, then me neither.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Pam, this is Eric and Donna.
 <br>
 We have biology class together.
 <br>
 Biology? Yeah.
 <br>
 See, Pam doesn&#39;t like to talk about school.
 <br>
 - Are you guys having fun? - No.
 <br>
 I have to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 My God, Kelso, you&#39;d rather be with her than Jackie? - I love her! - No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Okay, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 See, but Jackie&#39;s gonna be really jealous.
 <br>
 Good evening, kids.
 <br>
 So, is everyone having fun? Why, yes, we are, Ms.
 <br>
 Kaminsky.
 <br>
 There you are, Diane.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been looking all over for you.
 <br>
 Shall we dance? I am not going to dance with you, Fez.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t she adorable? They&#39;re all gonna laugh at you! Shut up, Ma, you&#39;re making the night too damn special.
 <br>
 You look beautiful.
 <br>
 My God.
 <br>
 So do you.
 <br>
 Do you want me to go inside and meet your No.
 <br>
 Trust me, she&#39;s lovely.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just go, all right? Is that for me? Yeah.
 <br>
 Here, I got this for you.
 <br>
 God, Steven, this is beautiful.
 <br>
 This whole experience has taught me that I don&#39;t need Michael to go to the prom.
 <br>
 I can go with anyone.
 <br>
 Even you.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s not do that.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 I have my dad&#39;s Lincoln.
 <br>
 Will you drive? Yeah.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got insurance, right? Wait, I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve decided what kind of business I&#39;m going to open.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the one thing people can&#39;t live without? Oxygen.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s not what I&#39;m selling.
 <br>
 So keep guessing.
 <br>
 Lemonade? Give up? I&#39;m about to.
 <br>
 Greeting cards.
 <br>
 Good wine.
 <br>
 This is such a great night.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s too bad our parents aren&#39;t out of town.
 <br>
 So we&#39;d have someplace to go.
 <br>
 For after.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Like, a motel room? Yeah.
 <br>
 That would&#39;ve been great.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause I got one.
 <br>
 Did you plan on telling me? No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s better that you didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause then it wouldn&#39;t have been spontaneous.
 <br>
 You are so the girl for me.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Why so glum, Fez? Mrs.
 <br>
 Clark, you may be good at teaching the music but you cannot help me in the ways of love.
 <br>
 Fez, has someone got you down? So far down, Mrs.
 <br>
 Clark.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a little ditty I&#39;ve been working on.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;ll help.
 <br>
 Hit it.
 <br>
 Midge, you don&#39;t know the first thing about having a business.
 <br>
 - But there&#39;s no risk, Bob.
 <br>
 - Why not? Because it&#39;s your money! Kitty, don&#39;t you think I should have my own card shop? Midgie, hold on.
 <br>
 - I think I have a dynamite solution.
 <br>
 - Really? Yeah.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I love you.
 <br>
 So, I want you to have another baby and stop bugging me.
 <br>
 Oh, Bob.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 So, how much this whole setup gonna cost you, Bob? Plenty.
 <br>
 But I figure it&#39;ll be cheaper than a divorce.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll see.
 <br>
 And here we are.
 <br>
 This is so romantic.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Forman and Donna.
 <br>
 And they&#39;re gonna do it! Forman! Forman! Yeah.
 <br>
 You know what? Those guys are just jerks.
 <br>
 I forgot about them already.
 <br>
 Hang on.
 <br>
 Big stain.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m just gonna go grab a towel.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Good God! They say they&#39;re more scared of you than you are of them.
 <br>
 Right, so? You know, Donna, I&#39;ve thought about this moment like, a thousand times.
 <br>
 Me, too.
 <br>
 One, two, three.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 When you thought about this moment, was it like this? Not really.
 <br>
 You know, I was having a pretty good time at prom.
 <br>
 Me, too.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get out of here.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Donna, what if this is our only chance? It won&#39;t be.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that I always pictured Michael and I together at the prom.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the way it was supposed to be, you know? Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 Well Pam&#39;s butt looks really big in that dress.
 <br>
 No, it doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yeah, no, it doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 But thank you.
 <br>
 Do you mind if we just sit down? Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go grab some punch.
 <br>
 Hyde, you brought Jackie to the prom? You&#39;re supposed to be my friend and you dogged me.
 <br>
 She cried, man.
 <br>
 Is she having a good time? &#39;Cause she looks real pretty.
 <br>
 All right, look, you big baby.
 <br>
 She wants to be with you, and you want to be with her.
 <br>
 So, why don&#39;t you stop whining about it and just go be with each other.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause the whole thing sickens me.
 <br>
 But what am I gonna do with Pam? Don&#39;t worry about it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take care of Pam.
 <br>
 Excuse me, Pam.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Have you ever seen the backseat of a Lincoln Continental? Lots of times.
 <br>
 Would you like to see another one? - Sure.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Michael.
 <br>
 You look beautiful.
 <br>
 You look really handsome.
 <br>
 I miss you.
 <br>
 I miss you, too.
 <br>
 Eric, please may I have your motel room key, please? Fez, I&#39;m not going to a motel with you.
 <br>
 Yes, and you also said you would not dance with me.
 <br>
 <br>
