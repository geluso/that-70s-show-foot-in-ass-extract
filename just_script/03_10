<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Well- [Chuckles] Okay.
 <br>
 Now that we&#39;re all in the van and you guys can&#39;t change your mind I just want you to know that we&#39;re not exactly on the way to my uncle&#39;s fabulous cabin in the woods.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really more of an ice shack.
 <br>
 Did you say ice shack? Hmm? Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, and, uh, the hot tub- [Chuckles] It&#39;s really more of a garbage can.
 <br>
 Oh, but it&#39;s also the bathroom, so- - Kelso, turn this van around! - No, Donna, wait.
 <br>
 Is there beer? Tons.
 <br>
 Hey, and we don&#39;t even need a refrigerator &#39;cause it&#39;s so freakin&#39; cold.
 <br>
 - Paradise.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, and, uh, before we pick upJackie I just want to make sure everybody knows what this trip is about.
 <br>
 The fabulous hot-tub toilet? No.
 <br>
 Eric, tell her about my master plan.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 See, Kelso, when you start a sentence with the words &#34;master plan,&#34; I just kind of know it&#39;s gonna be stupid, so I just naturally tune out.
 <br>
 Okay, well, my master plan is- Eric! Pay attention! This is about a romantic double date.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you and Donna and me and Jackie.
 <br>
 Kelso, you do know you&#39;re not actually dating Jackie, right? That&#39;s why it&#39;s a secret double date.
 <br>
 See, I told Jackie that the whole gang was coming but then, I didn&#39;t invite Hyde, especially not Fez.
 <br>
 He&#39;s all overJackie.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not doing this.
 <br>
 Turn this van around! No! I need you guys.
 <br>
 See, if you&#39;re there- You guys are, like, the perfect couple.
 <br>
 And-And if you&#39;re there then, I can just copy all the sissy, loser things that Eric does for you.
 <br>
 I really do enjoy your sissy, loser things.
 <br>
 Yeah, like when I had first dibs on that seat, but I took the hump.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a small price to pay to keep my lady happy.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 I want to be that dork.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 [Engine Revs] - Kelso, why are you speeding up? - I gotta beat this light.
 <br>
 - Why? - I just- I gotta! [Brakes Squeal] - Damn it! - [Door OPens] [Panting] What are you doing? I&#39;ve been chasing you for six blocks.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, buddy.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t see you.
 <br>
 Yeah, nice try.
 <br>
 I know all about your master plan.
 <br>
 Now, drive, you sneaky son of a bitch.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! You brought me to an outhouse? Actually, Jackie- [Bangs On Can] That&#39;s the outhouse.
 <br>
 No! No, it&#39;s an ice shack, for fishing.
 <br>
 L-This is gonna be a blast.
 <br>
 I me- It is so beautiful out here.
 <br>
 Plus, I brought lotion.
 <br>
 Ooh, it&#39;s kinda cold.
 <br>
 Here, take my jacket.
 <br>
 I love you.
 <br>
 God, we are such the perfect couple.
 <br>
 I&#39;m cold too.
 <br>
 Well, damn, Jackie.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t control the weather! Here, Jackie, take my coat.
 <br>
 Ohh, thanks, Fez.
 <br>
 So, sweetie, what do you want to do? - Whatever you want to do, honey.
 <br>
 - I want to go inside.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s what I want to do too.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God! Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Hey, what the hell was that jacket business, man? Uh, you&#39;re making me look bad.
 <br>
 Look, Kelso, you are my good, good friend but I will stop at nothing to win Jackie and if you&#39;re in my way, I will destroy you.
 <br>
 This is nice, you coming home for lunch.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Good afternoon, sunshine.
 <br>
 So, what have you got Planned for today? Same as every day.
 <br>
 Lie on the couch, do my nails, avoid talking to you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not going that well, so far.
 <br>
 Red, that girl does nothing but party all night and sleep all day.
 <br>
 She&#39;s gonna end up like Aunt Martha.
 <br>
 Remember the beer gut on her? She&#39;s not gonna end up like Fat Martha.
 <br>
 Poor woman got so large she couldn&#39;t play putt-putt.
 <br>
 Geez, don&#39;t remind me.
 <br>
 That par two was the longest three hours of my life.
 <br>
 Red, your daughter is drifting.
 <br>
 So what are you gonna do? I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;m gonna do.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna start eating my lunch at the office.
 <br>
 Leo, man, glad you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been really busy.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah? I guess my &#34;buy one, get one free&#34; flyer is really bringing in the business.
 <br>
 That&#39;s &#39;cause you forgot the &#34;buy one&#34; part.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Well, good thing we&#39;re closing early, man &#39;cause I need you to give me a ride over to my Cousin Larry&#39;s.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t have a car, man.
 <br>
 - You can drive mine, man.
 <br>
 - I can&#39;t drive since my license got suspended.
 <br>
 - Why? What&#39;d you do? Well, I dropped it in some soda, you know? And it just hung there, suspended.
 <br>
 And then when I was looking at it, I ran a red light.
 <br>
 Boy, ice fishing&#39;s fun.
 <br>
 I like this place, out here in the middle of a frozen lake.
 <br>
 It&#39;s cozy, don&#39;t you think, Jackie? If by &#34;cozy,&#34; you mean &#34;small and smelly,&#34; then, yes! [Laughing] Good one, Jackie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Well, she needs a sense of humor with an unfaithful ex-boyfriend who brings her to a dump like this.
 <br>
 Ow.
 <br>
 - Nice.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 I mean, Eric would never take Donna to a place like this.
 <br>
 Fez, it wouldn&#39;t matter where we were.
 <br>
 - Just being together makes it fun.
 <br>
 - Aw.
 <br>
 But I would never bring you to a place like this because I know that you don&#39;t like such small, smelly places.
 <br>
 You know me so well.
 <br>
 Eskimo kiss.
 <br>
 Too bad Kelso doesn&#39;t know anything aboutJackie.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 That is not true.
 <br>
 I know everything about her.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;ll bet I know more aboutJackie than Eric knows about Donna.
 <br>
 Whoa, Kelso.
 <br>
 Walk before you run, baby.
 <br>
 You think you know me, Michael? Then prove it.
 <br>
 Oh, I have an idea.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s play The Newlywed Game.
 <br>
 Eric and Donna versus Kelso and Jackie.
 <br>
 And I will be the impartial judge who gets Jackie in the end.
 <br>
 What? I mean, uh, good- good luck to everyone.
 <br>
 [Radio: Rock] Hey, Leo, what&#39;s in the bag, man? How can I put this? Let&#39;s just say in this bag are illegal drugs.
 <br>
 What? Come on, man.
 <br>
 You know I&#39;m on probation! Nah, it&#39;s cool, man.
 <br>
 All you have to do is just not get pulled over.
 <br>
 [Sirens Wail] What did I just tell you, man? Gentlemen, our ladies have already written down the answers to their questions.
 <br>
 First up, Eric.
 <br>
 Eric, what is Donna&#39;s favorite Pizza toPPing? Pepperoni.
 <br>
 - [Fez] Donna? - Pepperoni! - We&#39;re such the perfect couple! - I know! [Clears Throat] Now, Kelso- Mushrooms! No, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 That is not your question.
 <br>
 - And minus two for interrupting the host.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 - Minus two.
 <br>
 - Okay, sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Minus two.
 <br>
 Now, Kelso, last summer you &#34;accidently&#34; bounced Jackie off a trampoline.
 <br>
 When she woke up in the hospital, what were her first words? Oh, uh, you- &#34;Michael, you idiot.
 <br>
 &#34; [Gasps] Michael, you remembered! Wow, he remembered.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, according to Donna what is Donna&#39;s last name? Pinciotti.
 <br>
 - [Shrieks] - Oh, my God! Yes! Correct.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Now, Kelso Jackie has distant relatives in the Cook Islands.
 <br>
 In the early 1900s, what species of turtle did they save from extinction? Take your time.
 <br>
 Ladderback.
 <br>
 - [Laughs] - [Screams] Michael, you&#39;re amazing! [Screams] Oh.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 No hugging! I&#39;m sorry, all right? I forgot.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right, and let&#39;s try to remember that, little lady.
 <br>
 Well, the score is horribly close.
 <br>
 I&#39;m very impressed, Michael.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I guess you just remember things about those you care about.
 <br>
 Oh, please.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna puke.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get this nightmare over with.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Okay, Donna if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? Um, well, there&#39;s stuff I&#39;d change but I know Eric, and he&#39;d say &#34;Nothing.
 <br>
 &#34; No, but, wait.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s not the question.
 <br>
 Wh-Why? What&#39;d you answer? It doesn&#39;t matter what I answered, because you answered wrong and I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t want to play anymore.
 <br>
 &#34;Huge Wile E.
 <br>
 Coyote feet&#34;? What the hell does that mean? It means you have enormous feet.
 <br>
 Jackie- Whoa, whoa, Fez.
 <br>
 Eric, you think I have enormous feet? No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 You think that.
 <br>
 Last week, you said you hated your &#34;huge Wile E.
 <br>
 Coyote feet.
 <br>
 &#34; - Eric, I only said that so you&#39;d say they&#39;re not big.
 <br>
 - And they&#39;re not big.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, but, dude, that&#39;s a lie.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, I don&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 No, Donna, no, you&#39;re looking at this all wrong.
 <br>
 Big feet make you, like, really stable.
 <br>
 You know? Really hard to knock over.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Get bent.
 <br>
 See? I have small feet.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where- Donna? Are you going somewhere, honey? Okay, this is it.
 <br>
 For all the marbles.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 What was your answer? Um, hmm well if I had to change one thing about me it would have to be that I&#39;m too cute and all other girls are jealous.
 <br>
 Kelso? [Kelso Screams] [Shrieks] Oh, my God, Michael! That&#39;s amazing! Oh! L- Oh, my God, I almost- Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I gotta go talk to Donna.
 <br>
 Who would know that you would win a battle of wits? Yeah.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Turns out that the key to winning Jackie&#39;s heart was in the last place I thought to look my own brain.
 <br>
 Donna, I think I&#39;m actually feeling something for Michael, you know? Donna, would you please stop looking at your feet and listen to me? A boyfriend is supposed to tell you the things you don&#39;t like about yourself are fine.
 <br>
 Like last week, I told Eric his pecs were getting bigger.
 <br>
 But I mean, come on.
 <br>
 If you lie him on his back, you could fill up his chest with water.
 <br>
 Maybe I&#39;m just lonely.
 <br>
 Or I need a sign from, like, God.
 <br>
 Or, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Maybe I just need someone to tell me if I&#39;m crazy.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re crazy.
 <br>
 Not you, Bigfoot.
 <br>
 Hi, honey.
 <br>
 How was- Oh, not over yet.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] No, it&#39;s not, Red.
 <br>
 Go make Laurie do something with her life.
 <br>
 I mean it.
 <br>
 Now! Oh.
 <br>
 You know, when a guy comes home from work he just wants to sit down and have a nice quiet beer.
 <br>
 Well, she drank your beer because she doesn&#39;t have a future.
 <br>
 Fine, Kitty.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going! Okay, honey.
 <br>
 First of all always save one beer for Daddy.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Second of all we feel that you need to get some direction in your life.
 <br>
 And by &#34;we,&#34; I mean your mother.
 <br>
 See, honey.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not really worried.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I know you&#39;re gonna find a nice guy and get married.
 <br>
 - Exactly.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 Someone who can take care of you, who&#39;s rich, who&#39;s not Kelso.
 <br>
 And I think this is a plan that might just work out for you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 But, Daddy, I mean, if I wanted to have a career of my own, I could, right? Well, sure.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t want you to set yourself up for- Like what happened at the college- l-lf you set the bar too high, the fall might be- You see, you&#39;re just so pretty.
 <br>
 [Chuckles Nervously] Here&#39;s five dollars.
 <br>
 Good evening, gentlemen.
 <br>
 Is there a problem, &#34;ossifer?&#34; Did you just say &#34;ossifer?&#34; Uh, no sir, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I distinctly heard him say officer, sir.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 I pulled you over because your left brake light is out.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to write you up a warning.
 <br>
 Close one, man.
 <br>
 [Sighs] I thought for sure he was gonna ask what&#39;s in the bag.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still right here.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 - Dog food? - We were framed! I mean- [Blows Raspberry] Of course it&#39;s dog food.
 <br>
 What&#39;d you think it was? Illegal drugs? [Chuckles] All right, weirdos.
 <br>
 Drive safe.
 <br>
 Dog food? Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean- Oh, wait, man.
 <br>
 If the dog food&#39;s in this bag, then where&#39;s- [Gasps] Oh, wow.
 <br>
 I gotta check on my dog, man! - Jackie, l- - Don&#39;t speak, Michael.
 <br>
 I am very close to letting myself experience strong feelings of not hating you.
 <br>
 I just need a sign.
 <br>
 I brought the lotion.
 <br>
 No, okay.
 <br>
 I want you to guess a number between one and ten.
 <br>
 - Seven.
 <br>
 - Guess again.
 <br>
 - Three.
 <br>
 - Close enough.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Jackie, if you go out that door with him whatever we might have had between us is over forever.
 <br>
 Look! The reason I haven&#39;t done anything with my life is because I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do.
 <br>
 Well, the post office has a dental plan that&#39;s supposed- Shh! But, Daddy, you forced me to sit down and think about it and now, I have found my passion! Hair! The musical? No! Hair! I&#39;m going to beauty school! This isn&#39;t something you do through the mail, is it? No! It&#39;s a real school.
 <br>
 - Oh, well, yea! [Chuckles] - Congratulations, sweetheart.
 <br>
 - So, Kitty, what do you think? - Eh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 [Squeaking] Well, looks likeJackie and Kelso are back together.
 <br>
 I won and Fez lost I won and Fez lost [Cracking] - You guys, what happened? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 The van just started shakin&#39;.
 <br>
 Uh, guys.
 <br>
 [Ice Cracking, Metal ScraPing] Quick! Everyone give me your belts.
 <br>
 Together we can pull it out.
 <br>
 - [Metal ScraPing] - Come on! Gi- Michael, this is it! This is the sign I was looking for! God doesn&#39;t want us to be together! Who cares? I&#39;m losing my van! See? That was always the problem with us, Michael.
 <br>
 It was always about you.
 <br>
 - Jackie, are you losing your van? - No! Then shut up! Wow, watching Kelso&#39;s van sink makes the size of my feet seem unimportant.
 <br>
 See, Donna? Size doesn&#39;t matter.
 <br>
 - Oh, you don&#39;t have to tell me.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s-Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s- There&#39;s my sweet girl.
 <br>
 Fez, I&#39;m cold.
 <br>
 Frankly my dear I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass.
 <br>
 [Leo] Dr.
 <br>
 Zhivago, I&#39;m home.
 <br>
 ! I brought your food.
 <br>
 ! [Fanfare] [Barking] [Barking Continues]
