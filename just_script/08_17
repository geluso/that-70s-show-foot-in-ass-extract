 Steven, why is there lingerie behind my canned goods ? Oh, sorry.
 <br>
 That&#39;s Sam&#39;s.
 <br>
 Before we split up, our love life felt a little boring so we decided to branch out and try some new locations.
 <br>
 By the way, this is a good sturdy table.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven.
 <br>
 Good morning ! Morning Red.
 <br>
 You&#39;re up early.
 <br>
 You&#39;re retired, you should be sleeping in.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I was awoken by the pleasant sound of birds chirping outside my window.
 <br>
 And now that I don&#39;t have to work, I finally have time to poison them.
 <br>
 I feed those birds bread every day.
 <br>
 Good, that will make it easier.
 <br>
 Red, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve embraced retirement yet.
 <br>
 What you need to do is to get yourself a robe, go sit down on the porch and shake your fists and yell things like:&#34;dang nabbit, why I outta&#34; I have to say, I looked forward to retirement as much as I looked forward to playing catch with my son.
 <br>
 And both of them have left me bitterly disappoint.
 <br>
 Well, you know, we could take a trip.
 <br>
 When Amy O&#39;Brian&#39;s husband retired, they went to see the Nutcracker museum in Rhode Island.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t have to go anywhere that fancy but there is that cave in West Virginia I&#39;ve been wanting to see.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a good idea Red.
 <br>
 You and Kitty should travel, you know, see the world.
 <br>
 I saw the world when I was in the navy.
 <br>
 It shot at me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know West Virginia is supposed to be pretty nice.
 <br>
 It is the Ohio of the Atlantic states.
 <br>
 Well, if you need something to do, you can always come down to help me at the record store.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a light switch that keeps shocking people.
 <br>
 Although on the upside the jolts seems to make Leo remember stuff.
 <br>
 Yeah ! Sure, I&#39;ll help you out.
 <br>
 It will be good to get out of the house.
 <br>
 If I have to listen to Phil Donahue tell one more housewife that it isn&#39;t her fault that her life is messed up I gonna drive to Chicago and hit him in the head with a hammer.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna, I have something to admit to you but it&#39;s something really embarrassing.
 <br>
 You read a book for pleasure ? I like Fez.
 <br>
 Wow ! Well I guess the only thing I have to say is, I freaking knew it ! Donna ! Look, I know I made that stupid list to figure out who my perfect match should be, and you were right, it&#39;s Fez.
 <br>
 This is one of the biggest thing I&#39;ve ever heard you said.
 <br>
 I know, I know.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I like him.
 <br>
 No ! You admitted I was right.
 <br>
 Okay, are you sure you like Fez ? I mean, think about all the things you said about him over the years.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a bad, poor, sweaty, stinky, crazy, sick, ridiculous, foreign, spazoid, weirdo.
 <br>
 Okay, alright Donna, you busted me.
 <br>
 I like a bad, poor, sweaty, sticky, crazy, ridiculous, sick, foreign, spazoid, weirdo.
 <br>
 Hey lucious ladies ! Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez ! What&#39;s up ? Well, I made up a new way to play Candy Land, where I will eat the appropriate candy for each square I land on.
 <br>
 So Jackie, get prepared to come home to a candy-covered-pants-less roommate.
 <br>
 Wait ! Why do you have to take your pants off to play ? You don&#39;t know me at all ! There it goes, Jackie.
 <br>
 Your candy-covered-pants-less prince charming.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 8 episode 17 &#34;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&#34; Traduction par Mona Sax La Forman Team Bis* Fez, now that I&#39;m spending so much time here, maybe you should get a water bed.
 <br>
 That  way we won&#39;t keep Jackie up with all the squeaking.
 <br>
 Yeah, sorry about that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a squeaker.
 <br>
 Donna I like a squeaker.
 <br>
 Wh, what I am gonna do ? Okay look, a few years ago, - I went to see a therapist.
 <br>
 - Looser My parents were going through their divorce and it helped.
 <br>
 Not everyone who goes to a therapist is a looser.
 <br>
 Ok wait so, - you think this therapist actually helped you ? - Yeah ! He must be pretty good if he convinced you you&#39;re not a looser.
 <br>
 Ouah, man ! Impressive ! Yeah, Mr Forman is real good at fixing stuff.
 <br>
 No, 6 across, impressive.
 <br>
 No wait, that&#39;s more than 3 letters.
 <br>
 There you go ! Oh, nice job Red.
 <br>
 The only problem is that now I can see how dirty everything is.
 <br>
 I gotta do something about that.
 <br>
 There you go.
 <br>
 Alright man, thanks.
 <br>
 I guess I&#39;ll see you later.
 <br>
 Actually I thought I&#39;d fix that wobbly chair before I left.
 <br>
 Take a high, carphead ! Hey, quiet ! Oh, sorry, it&#39;s quilt.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just saying, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m in a therapist office.
 <br>
 I mean, there is no way I&#39;ll be able to talk for a whole hour.
 <br>
 Well, thank you Dr.
 <br>
 Hamond.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, I am pretty and I am special.
 <br>
 And  I am in the wrong office.
 <br>
 Wow, that was a tough hour.
 <br>
 Come on in girls.
 <br>
 Have a seat.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Hello ? Oh, hello Helen.
 <br>
 Fine ! I&#39;ll heat up my own dinner ! God knows you haven&#39;t heat up anything in our home in months.
 <br>
 Well, have a great time, eh ? So ! Donna, nice to see you again.
 <br>
 How are your folks ? Well, uhm, still crazy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re telling me ! They paid for my watch.
 <br>
 And you must be Jackie.
 <br>
 Yeah, but before you think there is anything wrong with me.
 <br>
 You see, I&#39;m only here because I like this boy and I don&#39;t wanna like him so you know, if you could just write a prescription for that, I&#39;ll be on my way.
 <br>
 Do you see how messed up she is ? Still eating your cuticles ? No.
 <br>
 Jackie, first tell me about some of the other men that you had feelings for.
 <br>
 Okay, well, there is Mickael, who cheated on me.
 <br>
 And there is Steven who would rather vandalize a car than committing to a relationship.
 <br>
 And now there&#39;s Fez.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s been after me for years and who is really, really sweet, but I never paid any attention to him &#39;cause you know, he&#39;s foreign.
 <br>
 He seems like a fine man, or at least he is now before you get you sadistic female claws into him and make him forget that he&#39;s even a man at all.
 <br>
 Well, none of this matters anyway because of course now that I like Fez, he  has a girlfriend.
 <br>
 Have you ever considered that you like unavailable men ? I mean, the others were emotionally unavailable but you weren&#39;t interested in Fez until he was taken.
 <br>
 Wow, so I don&#39;t really like Fez, I just think I like Fez because he has a girlfriend.
 <br>
 Do you see how messed up she is, Doctor.
 <br>
 I mean she&#39;s got some real issues.
 <br>
 I noticed you died your hair.
 <br>
 What are you running away from ? I just want people to like me ! Jackie, just remember that whoever you end up with, the key to any relationship is good communication.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Hello ? Helen, I told you I&#39;d move it as soon as Al can help me.
 <br>
 Well, I wish you had more upper body strength.
 <br>
 No, you are.
 <br>
 Noo, youu are.
 <br>
 GO TO HELL YOU COW ! So, yes, good communication ! That&#39;s the key.
 <br>
 Why is the closed sign on the door ? Oh, Red put that up.
 <br>
 He said I could either have a closed sign up the door or an open sign on my ass.
 <br>
 I should never have asked him to come down, man, he&#39;s bad for business.
 <br>
 You think that&#39;s bad for business, I&#39;ve been stealing money for months ! Red ! Red ! Hey, man, why are you working so hard ? You should be enjoying your retirement, you know ? There&#39;s still plenty to do here.
 <br>
 The hinge on that door is busted.
 <br>
 The window needs caulking and that back room is such a mess, you got a bunch of weeds growing in there.
 <br>
 Look, man.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just call it today, you know ? You&#39;re retired, it&#39;s 2 o&#39;clock, hey ! It&#39;s almost dinner time ! Are you kicking me out ? No ! You know Yeah ! Look, wh, why don&#39;t you just go home ? I don&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 He seems mad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a good thing you&#39;ll never have to see him again.
 <br>
 Oh oh ! Fez, great news ! I have an opportunity to do something that&#39;s gonna make me incredibly happy.
 <br>
 - Oh, that&#39;s wonderful ! - I&#39;m gonna become a nun.
 <br>
 YOU SELFISH WHORE ! I&#39;m joining the covent next week so I&#39;m sorry, but if it makes you feel any better, you&#39;re the last man to ever touch me unless I meet someone in Italy before I take my vows.
 <br>
 See ya ! Hey, Fez ! What&#39;s going on ? Hillary broke up with me.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I just need someone to hold me and tell me it&#39;s alright.
 <br>
 I gotta go find Hyde.
 <br>
 I am pretty.
 <br>
 I am special.
 <br>
 My casserole is not too oniony.
 <br>
 Hey ! Oh, Steven.
 <br>
 I need to talk to you.
 <br>
 How could you kick Red out of your store ? I wasn&#39;t expecting him home so early and he walked in on me taking a bath without any bubbles.
 <br>
 There goes the mystery.
 <br>
 Sorry Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, he was in the way.
 <br>
 In the way ? When your parents left you and we took you in, did we say you were in the way ? No ! We fed you and loved you and we let you in to our Cirrus family portrait.
 <br>
 Look, I asked him to fix one little switch, the next thing I know he&#39;s pouding and sweating and swearing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like watching Fez eating a cake.
 <br>
 Well, you need to find a way to make Red feel useful and you know what else you nee to find ? A beige cardigan ! Cause that&#39;s what&#39;s we&#39;re wearing in this year&#39;s picture.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t wanna hear about how it&#39;s not cool I just wanna you to put the damn thing on, smile and say FREAKING CHEESE ! Jackie, what is it about me that makes everyone leave ? I&#39;m going to die alone with nothing but a room full of candy and pornography to keep me company.
 <br>
 Although when I say that, it sounds okay.
 <br>
 Oh, okay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not going to die alone.
 <br>
 Yes, I am.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a foreign weirdo.
 <br>
 No ! no, you, you have fascinating stories about far away lands.
 <br>
 I scare women away with my clingingness.
 <br>
 But when someone needs you, you&#39;re always there.
 <br>
 People barely understand a word I say.
 <br>
 Well, yes.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s a good thing because sometimes you say really stupid things.
 <br>
 Okay, look Fez, you&#39;re a great guy.
 <br>
 Okay ? You&#39;re funny and you&#39;re cute and any girl would be lucky to have you.
 <br>
 Oh, Jackie, you&#39;re so sweet.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t I find a woman like you who likes me ? I gotta go.
 <br>
 Well, maybe if I watch some TV, I&#39;ll feel better.
 <br>
 And now Masterpiece presents The Lonely Foreigner.
 <br>
 Hyde, I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going to destroy Mr Forman&#39;s house and that&#39;s supposed to make him feel better ? Yeah ! Then he can fix everything and feel very useful.
 <br>
 Red would be happier than the time he chased those dead heads off in the park.
 <br>
 Well, you can&#39;t camp there, man.
 <br>
 Some bold guy chases you off.
 <br>
 I just ripped that off the furnace.
 <br>
 I busted the TV.
 <br>
 I totally destroyed the washing machine, man ! Oh, hey, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here man.
 <br>
 Things are just falling apart around here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s freezing in my room, the TV&#39;s broken and this thing just popped out the washing machine.
 <br>
 Jeez, I&#39;m gone for one day, the whole house goes to hell ! Yeah, it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re here so you can fix everything.
 <br>
 You know what ? I&#39;ll get to this stuff later.
 <br>
 Later ? Yeah.
 <br>
 I was thinking about what you said this afternoon at the record store.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I do deserve to slow down and enjoy my retirement.
 <br>
 So, right now, I&#39;m  going fishing.
 <br>
 Yeah, but it&#39;s like 10 degrees in my room.
 <br>
 Can I at least call the repair-man ? Sure, but you&#39;re paying for it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on a fixed income.
 <br>
 I&#39;m retired.
 <br>
 This is bad, we destroyed everything, on the bright side, I don&#39;t live here.
 <br>
 What I am gonna do, man.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t watch Tv, I can&#39;t sleep in my room.
 <br>
 I guess I could drag my bed right here.
 <br>
 Hyde, man.
 <br>
 Wait to see what I did to your bed.
 <br>
 Ok, Donna.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 I thought I only liked Fez because he was unavailable.
 <br>
 But now he&#39;s available and I still like him.
 <br>
 I mean, I almost kissed him.
 <br>
 On the mouth.
 <br>
 He eats couscous with that thing.
 <br>
 Okay, before I tell you what to do, let me just get one thing straight.
 <br>
 You really like Fez ? Fez is the one you like.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 So you wanna go out on dates with Fez.
 <br>
 And make out with Fez.
 <br>
 - Yes ! - Okay.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s Xmas morning and you get up and your gift is Fez.
 <br>
 - Donna ! Sorry.
 <br>
 Alright, well look.
 <br>
 If you really like him, you&#39;re gonna have to tell him.
 <br>
 I know, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 So uh I heard you liked Fez.
 <br>
 WHAT  !? How did you hear that ? Since we weren&#39;t trap in a soundproof lead box, we were able to hear your delicate voice from across the street.
 <br>
 Alright, okay, I know you guys probably think I&#39;m crazy and I&#39;m going from guy to guy but Fez has always been there for me and he makes me feel good about myself.
 <br>
 So go ahead, go ahead make fun of me.
 <br>
 No, I think that&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 You know, Fez is a good guy.
 <br>
 And I think if he makes you happy that&#39;s what you should do.
 <br>
 Wow, Steven, thanks.
 <br>
 And if it doesn&#39;t work out I hear Bob&#39;s available.
 <br>
 And if that&#39;s no good, here comes the garbage man.
 <br>
 Oh hey, there&#39;s a guy across the street you haven&#39;t done.
 <br>
 Oh hey Fez, we need to talk.
 <br>
 Yes, we do.
 <br>
 I thought about what you said and you were right.
 <br>
 - I was ? - Yes.
 <br>
 Hillary did me a big favor by leaving.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Okay, I think so too.
 <br>
 And what I realize is, I shouldn&#39;t be tied down to one woman.
 <br>
 Wait, what ? Yes, I should be spreading my seeds all across the land.
 <br>
 So, America, get ready, cause Fez is coming out and no woman is safe.
 <br>
 Except you.
 <br>
 Nighty night.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t get me started on my home life.
 <br>
 My wife and I haven&#39;t slept together for months.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s not all good news.
 <br>
 Oh, well, looks like our hour is almost up.
 <br>
 But it seems like you could use a drink.
 <br>
 Pour one for yourself.
 <br>
 Oh, no I never touch this stuff.
 <br>
 Oh, what the hell ? Doctor&#39;s orders !
 <br>
