 Ahh, to be young and trapped in a lovely scheme of a marriage.
 <br>
 Kitty, where&#39;s the coffee? - Oh, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I almost forgot.
 <br>
 Since no one fixed my sink yet, today instead of coffee we&#39;re having pipe sludge.
 <br>
 You know the doctor told me not to do household chores.
 <br>
 It&#39;s either a working sink or a dead husband, it&#39;s your choice.
 <br>
 Well Red somebody&#39;s gotta do something around here, the garage needs to be painted, the lawn mower won&#39;t start and I&#39;m getting tired of running to the hose everytime I need bourbon and water.
 <br>
 Fine, fine we&#39;ll let Eric do it.
 <br>
 Maybe if I supervise him he&#39;ll only screw up half as much.
 <br>
 Yeah, thanks dad, you know what i got it.

 <br>

 <br>
 But I have to use the bathroom.
 <br>
 - What? I have to use the bathroom! Well go ahead.
 <br>
 But you only get one flush so make it count.
 <br>
 Well I guess I can hold it.
 <br>
 I just hope I don&#39;t sneeze.
 <br>
 Would you sit still.
 <br>
 - Jackie, she&#39;s not a doll.
 <br>
 Well not a good one anyway.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want a makeover.
 <br>
 You&#39;re suppose to be helping me with my homework.
 <br>
 Homework is for ugly girls.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Pretty girls get geeky boys to do their homework for them.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re supposed to do fun stuff like go roller-skating.
 <br>
 Not teach her to prostitute herself for geometry notes.
 <br>
 She&#39;s cool.

 Why can&#39;t she be my big sister? See, Donna already has a little sister.
 <br>
 Her name is Eric.
 <br>

 Get under the sink and loosen that disposal so we can get to the pipes.
 <br>
 Under there? But, it&#39;s all spidery.
 <br>

 <br>
 Lower dumbass.
 <br>
 Alright, I&#39;m in.
 <br>

 <br>
 Oh my god.
 <br>
 A brillo pad? You were afraid of a brillo pad? It bit me.
 <br>
 Boy, somewhere down the line I failed with you.
 <br>
 You know, I think it was that one day when you were ten and I cought you with those dolls.
 <br>
 They were action figures.
 <br>
 I wanna go to the movies.
 <br>
 Why? You&#39;re watching me live my life.
 <br>
 It&#39;s better than any movie.
 <br>
 Good afternoon, civilians.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s my frog you son of a bitch? Well the good news is I let him loose.
 <br>
 The bad news is he hopped in front of an eighteen wheeler.
 <br>
 He dodged the first wheel, but the last seventeen got him.
 <br>
 Did you show up in a cop car? My training officer let me take the cruiser out for a spin.
 <br>
 Mind if we check it out? - Fine, just don&#39;t touch anything.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in the bathroom taking care of some police business, or as the boys down at the station like to say I&#39;ll be taking the 10100.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you like to see a police car? - I already saw one when the police took my daddy to jail.
 <br>
 Alright, you know what, cheer up or you&#39;re not getting lunch.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re getting lunch.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have a clue when it comes deeling with kids.
 <br>
 Well if you think you&#39;re so good at it, why don&#39;t you give it a shot? Okay, I will.
 <br>
 C&#39;mon, Colette, you&#39;ve just been upgraded to Little Donna.
 <br>
 You know what.
 <br>
 It is your lose cause I was gonna let you give me a pedicure.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t belive they trusted Kelso with a cop car.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t belive he left the keys in it.
 <br>
 Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking? Burn rubber, little buddy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re out of soap in the mens room.
 <br>
 My eagle eye catches everything.
 <br>
 This is so exciting.
 <br>
 What should we do next? Plant some evidence? Bust some prostitutes? Plant some evidence in the bust of some prostitutes? Oh hey, check it out.
 <br>
 Walkie talkie.
 <br>
 Freeze, you&#39;re under arrest.
 <br>
 Freeze, you&#39;re under arrest.
 <br>
 Freeze, you&#39;re under arrest.
 <br>
 Oh yeah, that&#39;s the one.
 <br>
 This is officer Michael Kelso.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not wearing any pants.
 <br>
 Am I supposed to be driving all over the road? Cause I&#39;m loaded .
 <br>
 My car is gone.
 <br>
 Somebody call the police.
 <br>
 Okay that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t fix it.
 <br>
 I just, I can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 Oh, what&#39;s the problem now? Did the fuzzy dish towel jumped out and attack you? I can belive you said you said you failed with me.
 <br>
 Oh, c&#39;mon that was a joke.
 <br>
 You know like a &#34;priest and a rabin walk in to a bar&#34; or &#34;I&#39;ve failed with you&#34;.
 <br>
 Do you really think that? - No, not completely.
 <br>
 I mean, maybe you&#39;re not good at fixing stuff but you stayed behind from school to help the family out.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s admirable.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah it is.
 <br>
 Some might say it&#39;s the greatest gift a son can give his father.
 <br>
 No, the greatest gift a son could give his father is a Heisman trophy.
 <br>
 Look, you&#39;ve tortured yourself enough for one day, lets just pack it up and call the plumer.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Look I can fix some things.
 <br>
 Boba Fetts jet pack doesn&#39;t just glue itself back on.
 <br>
 You know what, I&#39;m gonna fix lawn mower.
 <br>
 Right now.
 <br>
 No, why would you wanna embarass yourself like that? I mean, I&#39;ll be standing there, and you&#39;ll be standing there and the mower won&#39;t work and I&#39;ll say something mean and claim it&#39;s a joke.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna fix that lawn mower.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna fix the hell out of it And when I&#39;m done, you&#39;re be able to race that baby at the Indy 500.
 <br>
 Look son, just so you know, the lawn mower is the red thing with wheels on it.
 <br>
 Yeah, well not for long.
 <br>
 More news after this.
 <br>
 You know if a white man has stolen that car it would be all over that news.
 <br>
 Fez, not having every cop in Wisconsin looking for us is probably a good thing.
 <br>
 Shut up, whitey.
 <br>
 Has anyone seen Little Jackie? - No, why? Ahh, never mind.
 <br>
 Oh my god, you lost Little Jackie? No, I didn&#39;t loose Little Jackie! We&#39;re playing hide and seek, and she&#39;s really, relly good.
 <br>
 Oh, so you look for her, but when you play with Fez you let him sit in a closet all day.
 <br>
 I can not belive you Donna, you said I didn&#39;t know what I was doing, and look at what you did.
 <br>
 Okay, are you gonna help me find her or not? - Well I&#39;m gonna have to.
 <br>
 I mean this is serious.
 <br>
 If we don&#39;t find that little girl, I&#39;m gonna get like half hour detention.
 <br>
 Where is my cop car? You know what, I&#39;m gonna count to three, and before I&#39;m done you better tell me where it is.
 <br>
 One, two two and a half Three.
 <br>
 No, you can&#39;t say three.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not how it works.
 <br>
 Did my frog know how it worked when he seen that tire coming? His tiny green life flashing before his eyes.
 <br>
 Guys c&#39;mon.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t just take somebodies car without asking permission especialy since I kind of took it without asking permission.
 <br>
 What? - You stole it? I was supposed to be watching it while my training officer got a hair cut.
 <br>
 They are gonna have my paper badge for this.
 <br>
 Mom, dad come quick, I fixed it.
 <br>

 <br>
 It was like God had control over my hands.
 <br>
 Let me start it for you.
 <br>
 - Eric don&#39;t.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve seen you use a wrench.
 <br>
 If you went lefty-lucy instead of righty- tighty we could all die.
 <br>
 Let me just put this in a garage.
 <br>
 But dad No,no honey, honey your father&#39;s right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not safe.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll let Bob start it later.
 <br>
 What did you do? Why? Why, why is it always my house? You really wanna now or you wanna just keep yelling? - I wanna keep yelling.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care whos fault it is, just get that thing out of here.
 <br>
 Now! - Yes sir.
 <br>
 Alright everybody show&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go in the house.
 <br>
 Dad, the lawn mower, I fixed the lawn mower.
 <br>
 You gotta see.
 <br>
 Kelso, wait Hey look Fez, just like your frog.
 <br>
 Oh well, it was broken anyway.
 <br>
 No, it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 I fixed it.
 <br>
 Mom, you belive me, don&#39;t you? - Of course I do honey.
 <br>
 I belive that you belive you fixed it.
 <br>
 Why are you on my seat? - This automobile has not moved.
 <br>
 Wait, you didn&#39;t ask me that.
 <br>
 Did you touch anything? Cause if you did, you are in big trouble.
 <br>
 No, I can assure you, everything is exactly as you left it.
 <br>
 Hey Kelso, did you get the cop car back before you boss found out you stole it? Okay, that I can explain that.
 <br>
 Where am I? Yeah, I can&#39;t explain that.
 <br>
 Socket wrench.

 Drives the spaceship, sits next to the hairy guy.
 <br>
 Han Solo.
 <br>
 Flathead screwdriver.
 <br>
 Oh, I know this.
 <br>
 Guy with the breathing problem.
 <br>
 Guy with the breathing problem? This is Darth freaking Vader.
 <br>
 Seriously dad if you don&#39;t know the dark lord of the Sith, the most hated enemy of the jedi warrior then I guess somewhere down the line I failed with you.
