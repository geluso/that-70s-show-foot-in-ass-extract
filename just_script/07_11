<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Guys, check it out.
 <br>
 Somebody just left all these toys at the police station.
 <br>
 Guess they figured if cops have something to play with, Then we won&#39;t stress out and accidentally shoot somebody.
 <br>
 Or, and stay with me here, inspector meathead, Maybe these toys are for the toy drive.
 <br>
 Yeah, Kelso, These toys are probably all those needy kids get on Christmas morning.
 <br>
 Holy crap! Is that an Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle? Oh, my god! Let&#39;s set it up.
 <br>
 We have to find something for Evel Knievel to crash into, like something funny.
 <br>
 Fez, lie down over here and close your eyes.
 <br>
 Oh, Man, I feel just like a kid on, like, I don&#39;t know, like some morning where kids get to open a lot of presents.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t feel right about this.
 <br>
 Oh, buddy, we&#39;re not gonna aim it at your head.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not worried about my head.
 <br>
 Awesome.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not worried about his head.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s aim it at his head.
 <br>
 No, I just don&#39;t feel right about taking these toys away from kids.
 <br>
 Oh, but, Fez, This could be the Christmas that I never had.
 <br>
 My parents wouldn&#39;t get me cool stuff when I was a kid.
 <br>
 Every year, I got a raincoat.
 <br>
 And then to make sure it worked, We had to go outside and Red would spray me with a hose.
 <br>
 Yeah, Fez, what about my Christmas, man? I mean, I&#39;d wake up in the morning, rush out in my P.
 <br>
 J.
 <br>
 S And find what strange man Santa had left laying underneath my mother.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll each open one present, but only one.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Look at what we&#39;ve done.
 <br>
 What should we do now? We need batteries.
 <br>
 A buttload.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 11 &#34;Winter&#34; Www.
 <br>
 Forom.
 <br>
 Com Thanks for helping me with my Christmas party, girls.
 <br>
 You know, this is the most important event of the year for the ladies of Point Place, or As we like to call ourselves, the Lopps.
 <br>
 You know, the Lopps are known for being super stuck-Up and totally 2-Faced.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait till I get in.
 <br>
 Hey, mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I need, like, a buttload of batteries.
 <br>
 What for? Oh, um, Kelso wants to see how badly he can shock himself.
 <br>
 Oh, Okay, they&#39;re in the drawer.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Steven, don&#39;t forget about the ladies of Point Place party tonight.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, I forgot.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t go.
 <br>
 Something more important came up.
 <br>
 But you promised you&#39;d go.
 <br>
 Jackie, If I promised, I clearly wasn&#39;t listening, Which you should have known, so This is your fault.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Steven.
 <br>
 He knows this is a big deal to me, and he doesn&#39;t even care.
 <br>
 Jackie, don&#39;t be so hard on him.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s a big deal to you, and I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Knock, knock.
 <br>
 Patty Ryals, I didn&#39;t know you were back in town.
 <br>
 Well, you always return to where you were young, Which I know for you, Kitty, is a long time ago.
 <br>
 Actually, I just dropped by to tell you I&#39;m taking over tonight&#39;s ladies of Point Place Christmas party.
 <br>
 What? No, I&#39;m in charge.
 <br>
 Past tense.
 <br>
 The Lopps remembered that you aren&#39;t the most reliable L.
 <br>
 Of P.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 After I reminded them about the punchbowl incident of 1973.
 <br>
 You dredged up my chappaquiddick? What did Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman do? She spiked the wrong punchbowl.
 <br>
 I missed the sixth grade Christmas play &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t walk a straight line.
 <br>
 Verti-Bird central, You are cleared for take off.
 <br>
 Prepare to transport funyun.
 <br>
 We have visual.
 <br>
 Funyun&#39;s remaining secure.
 <br>
 Verti-Bird to Kelso, prepare to receive funyun.
 <br>
 Roger that.
 <br>
 Awaiting funyun.
 <br>
 Funyun&#39;s under attack! Funyun&#39;s under attack! Steady with the funyun.
 <br>
 Houston, the funyun has landed.
 <br>
 - Yeah! - Yeah! What&#39;s going on? Eric flew a funyun into my mouth.
 <br>
 This is what&#39;s more important than going to a party with me? Jackie, I think you&#39;re overreacting And, yes.
 <br>
 You guys seriously need to grow up.
 <br>
 Okay, I think someone&#39;s a little mad that we didn&#39;t fly a funyun into her mouth.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven, I&#39;m going to that Christmas party, And if you don&#39;t come with me right now, you are in so much trouble.
 <br>
 Right now.
 <br>
 I&#39;m opening the door.
 <br>
 I&#39;m  stepping outside.
 <br>
 I&#39;m closing the door.
 <br>
 You are in so much trouble! Yeah, I thought Steven was maturing.
 <br>
 He&#39;s out of high school, he&#39;s got a job And lately he&#39;s even been taking his sunglasses off inside the house.
 <br>
 That&#39;s real progress, Donna.
 <br>
 Well, maybe what&#39;s going on with Hyde is the same thing that&#39;s going on with my boyfriend, Lieutenant funyun.
 <br>
 I bet it&#39;s that stupid Kelso.
 <br>
 He&#39;s  always talking them into having fun.
 <br>
 Steven should not be having fun.
 <br>
 He should be with me.
 <br>
 Okay, girls, time to get to the party.
 <br>
 Well, Jackie, look, I think Eric and Hyde are feeling the pressures of life And they wanna have one last blowout.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven does not need a blowout.
 <br>
 He needs a kick in the nads.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Christmas.
 <br>
 At holiday time, we say He needs a kick in the sleigh bells.
 <br>
 Kitty, these decorations look awful.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t your living room.
 <br>
 Everything has to match.
 <br>
 You should have mentioned that to your plastic surgeon.
 <br>
 Jackie Burkhart, welcome to the Lopps Christmas party.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your boyfriend? Oh, um, he can&#39;t be here.
 <br>
 He&#39;s at rich stockbroker school.
 <br>
 Well, then I&#39;m just gonna have to seat you with the single ladies of Point Place.
 <br>
 The Slopps? Ha! You&#39;re a slopp.
 <br>
 Hey, there, hi, there, ho, ho, ho, there.
 <br>
 Patty Ryals? It&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Well, yes, Santa, it&#39;s good to see you.
 <br>
 Bob Pinciotti.
 <br>
 We went out that time.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t have the beard then, although I think I wore a similar Red jacket.
 <br>
 Speaking of which, that&#39;s rented, so try not to sweat through it.
 <br>
 What a woman.
 <br>
 Bad news, Kitty.
 <br>
 I went by the police station to pick up the toys.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve been stolen.
 <br>
 - What? - Yeah, Makes me think the police in this town aren&#39;t that good.
 <br>
 Red, getting those gifts here was the only job Patty left me.
 <br>
 Okay, you need to go home, you need to find something, Anything, to wrap up and give away at the party.
 <br>
 Oh, fine, But this counts as one of your Christmas presents.
 <br>
 This is horrible, Taking toys from children.
 <br>
 What kind of monster would do such a thing? Argh! I&#39;m a monster! It&#39;s broken already? This toy&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 Looks like somebody needs a nappy-Nap.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I wanna open another present.
 <br>
 Forman, just take a rest.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not tired, okay? Can I have a turn? I&#39;m playing with it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re supposed to share.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wanna.
 <br>
 What the hell? Where did all these toys come from? Well, Dad, I guess I&#39;m just gonna have to tell you the truth.
 <br>
 It was Santa Claus.
 <br>
 How could you do this? I told them it was wrong.
 <br>
 I told them.
 <br>
 But then they drove a toy into my head, and it was all blurry after that.
 <br>
 These toys were for the needy kids at your mother&#39;s party, you idiot.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 There&#39;s, uh, There&#39;s no chance that they might want a raincoat, is there? Red, The thing is is that these toys are too nice for the needy kids.
 <br>
 You need to start them off with something simple, like a A ball of yarn.
 <br>
 Look, Dad, I think we can safely say that none of this would have happened If you had just bought me an Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle when I was younger.
 <br>
 I bought you one of those.
 <br>
 Santa left it under the tree that year when Oh, wait.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric&#39;s all tucked in, put out carrots for the reindeer and A little wine for Santa.
 <br>
 Look at this thing that I got for Eric.
 <br>
 You rev up the bike, and Evel Knievel goes flying.
 <br>
 In real life, he&#39;s a moron, but as a toy, he&#39;s awfully fun.
 <br>
 Let me see if I can make it over the garage.
 <br>
 Go! Damn.
 <br>
 I really thought I could make it over the garage.
 <br>
 Oh, well, everybody makes mistakes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna give you a pass on this one.
 <br>
 Just get these presents wrapped up and over to the community center.
 <br>
 Okay, yeah, we&#39;ll take care of it, dad.
 <br>
 All right, I think it&#39;s clear what we gotta do.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Can we at least drive the Stunt Cycle into Fez&#39;s head one more time? What  do you say, buddy? Well, It is Christmas.
 <br>
 - Set it up, boys.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 All right, Kitty, I brought some stuff from the house that I&#39;m sure the kids are gonna love.
 <br>
 A cheese grater? Kids love cheese.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like play-Doh to them.
 <br>
 Look, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 The real presents are gonna be here soon.
 <br>
 How do you know? Because you have to believe, Kitty Like me.
 <br>
 Believe in Christmas.
 <br>
 We need to stall.
 <br>
 Read the kids a story.
 <br>
 Well, I have a book in the car, but it&#39;s about the Korean war.
 <br>
 Well, go get it.
 <br>
 Better those kids suffer emotional damage than I look bad in front of the Lopps.
 <br>
 Tell you what, Santa will bring you the bike for Christmas if you go bring Santa a hoagie.
 <br>
 You know what I&#39;d really like for Christmas? Patty Ryals.
 <br>
 All you men ever think about is what you want.
 <br>
 What about what we want? Boys never grow up.
 <br>
 You know, one minute they agree to go to a party with you, and the next, They&#39;re in a basement full of stolen toys.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re no better, Sitting there pretending to be Santa Claus.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not Santa Claus? No.
 <br>
 No, no, he is.
 <br>
 He is, it&#39;s just that She is the evil ice witch.
 <br>
 Come on, let&#39;s get you some grown up punch.
 <br>
 Well, Can&#39;t bring these presents through the front door.
 <br>
 Looks like the chimney&#39;s the only way in.
 <br>
 I love being on a rooftop.
 <br>
 You can really see the whole town spread out in front of you.
 <br>
 It really is a crappy town, isn&#39;t it? All right, who&#39;s gonna take the plunge? Not me.
 <br>
 If we were jumping off the roof, I&#39;d do it, but This just seems foolish.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 I always wanted to save the day by sliding down a chimney.
 <br>
 That opportunity comes up Surprisingly rarely.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;m gonna do this.
 <br>
 Okay, it looks like it might be kind of a tight fit.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna fit all the way down! All right, Toss down the toys.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay, Forman.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just gonna sneak them in through the back door.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a back door? Yeah, I saw it on the way in.
 <br>
 I just wanted to see one of you guys go down the chimney.
 <br>
 &#34;Blood ran like a river that day on heartbreak ridge.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Hundreds of soldiers had given their lives and limbs trying to take&#34; Trying to take the North Pole.
 <br>
 &#34;The North koreans&#34; The North Pole Korean elves, &#34;Were weary from heaton that sun-Baked&#34; Snowy Christmas eve.
 <br>
 Kitty, where are the toys? Oh, um, This year in order to build anticipation, I hid them behind the curtain.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t see them now, not because they&#39;re not there, But because they&#39;re behind the curtain Hidden.
 <br>
 Well, the children won&#39;t wait.
 <br>
 Gladys, open the curtain.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Boys and girls, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just, you know, I think Santa hasn&#39;t quite finished Christmas Christmas Okay, kids, go get &#39;em! Who was in charge of giving out the toys here? It was Kitty.
 <br>
 I think she&#39;s been drinking.
 <br>
 Well, it was perfect.
 <br>
 The Lopps would like you to run our valentine&#39;s party.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in charge? Oh! Oh, This is the same as Lyndon Johnson being sworn in on the airplane after president Kennedy was Well, that was a tragedy, but I&#39;m in charge.
 <br>
 You hear that, Patty Ryals? She&#39;s in charge, So you will be taking orders from her.
 <br>
 So put that in your face lift and smoke it.
 <br>
 Oh, Look at the two of you.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t this just the most special Christmas? Where&#39;s Eric? Yeah, um Um, Yeah, Just  a quick question.
 <br>
 Um, where does that chimney up on the roof go? Well, I&#39;m kind of a Chimney enthusiast.
 <br>
 Oh, well, that goes into the bakery next door.
 <br>
 Hello? Hyde? Somebody? I&#39;ll be at the bakery.
 <br>
 Damn, that&#39;s a nice crop of Slopps.
 <br>
 Look at who decided to finally show up.
 <br>
 Jackie, are you still mad? Come on, man, this is not a big deal.
 <br>
 I mean, six months ago, you would have thought this was really funny.
 <br>
 Yeah, six months ago.
 <br>
 Steven, you can&#39;t act like this forever.
 <br>
 I need to know the guy I&#39;m in love with isn&#39;t gonna blow me off for a roomful of toys.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not a guarantee I can ever give you.
 <br>
 Well, things are changing, Steven.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;re practically grown up.
 <br>
 Yeah, and you know what? I&#39;m just trying to have a little fun before I Settle down and life goes to crap.
 <br>
 Is that what you think, that life with me will be crap? That&#39;s not what I said.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 At least now I know how you feel.
 <br>
 Jackie I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember our date, barry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Bob.
 <br>
 But Since it is Christmas eve and we are both alone, Would you like to get some dinner? I like the way you&#39;re thinking.
 <br>
 Or we could skip dinner.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m more active with a burger in me.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde, you and Jackie fix things up? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 If she wants to ruin Christmas, fine by me, &#39;cause I am not playing her game.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the stupid needy kids who are playing games.
 <br>
 They took all of our games.
 <br>
 Look what I found in the bakery curled up in the fireplace.
 <br>
 What the hell? You guys just left me there.
 <br>
 If I hadn&#39;t landed on, Well, some of the most delicious baked goods that I ever tasted, I very well could have starved to death.
 <br>
 All right, man, I&#39;ll make it up to you, &#39;Cause I got a Christmas present for everybody.
 <br>
 This is one messed up Christmas, man.
 <br>
 You guys are all starting to look like elves.
 <br>
 That must have freaked you out.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna fall off.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 It is gonna fall off.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Let me give you my recipe for holiday cheer Take one slopp, Add half a bottle of schnapps, Then stir freely with Fez.
 <br>

 You finally got me an Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle.
 <br>
 Ooh, you can go outside in your new raincoat and give it a try.
