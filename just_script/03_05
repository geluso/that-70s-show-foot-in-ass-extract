 Oh, don&#39;t put Batman in the clam of death, Riddler.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just gonna make him mad.
 <br>
 God, you&#39;re stupid.
 <br>
 Fez, for the last time, the Riddler can&#39;t hear you.
 <br>
 Riddle me this, Riddler.
 <br>
 When Batman escapes from the clam of death who will kick your riddle-telling ass in? Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 Riddle me this.
 <br>
 [Grunts] Then riddle me this.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Oh, but, Fez, only if you riddle me this.
 <br>
 Ow! Riddle me this, you son of a bitch! - Oh, my God! Guess what! - Stop! Fez! This could be important! You guys, the Roller Disco Doo-dah is coming to Kenosha next Friday! Oh, my God! Guess what! [Raspberry] See, now, that&#39;s the kind of thing the judges really frown upon during competition, Steven.
 <br>
 Excuse me? We&#39;re gonna be partners! Skating partners.
 <br>
 Hey, how about instead, you hit me in the face with a wrench, and I black out? Steven this is not just a last chance at roller disco.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a last chance at love- our love.
 <br>
 Now, will you or will you not skate with me? I would, Jackie but seeing you there in your cute little skating outfit with all your tassels and sequins I might be tempted to push you down a flight of stairs.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Jackie, what do you say- you and me, roller disco? I mean, we used to have some good moves, you know, like, when we did it so it would be like that except for with lights and skates.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Um, first of all, you make me sick.
 <br>
 Okay? Second, you&#39;re lame, and you make me sick.
 <br>
 Third, you make me sick, and any one of these guys would be a better partner than you, even Fez.
 <br>
 Really? Then I am in.
 <br>
 Um, no, I didn&#39;t really mean it, Fez.
 <br>
 Oh, then I am out.
 <br>
 Damn it.
 <br>
 Let me in.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! [TV] So, who willJackie choose as her roller disco partner? Who, who, who? No freakin&#39; way.
 <br>
 Hmm, how very sad.
 <br>
 [Sighs] No one to disco with.
 <br>
 Now, where did I leave my potato chips? Oh, there they are.
 <br>
 Look at that.
 <br>
 I left my soda back in the other side of the room! Refreshing.
 <br>
 God, my arm is sore! Wow, Fez! Oh, come on, Jackie! You&#39;re gonna pick him over me? All right.
 <br>
 Watch this.
 <br>
 [Grunts, Groans] Jackie, I&#39;m just a roller disco machine and I don&#39;t work for nobody but you.
 <br>
 [Kelso Groans] Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be partners.
 <br>
 But hear me now.
 <br>
 I want first prize.
 <br>
 If I lose and some stupid, spoiled rich girl wins I&#39;ll scream.
 <br>
 [Kelso] I am really hurt.
 <br>
 ! - Hi, sweetie.
 <br>
 How was work? - Oh, pretty good except for the fact that Dad&#39;s getting sued for firing a Price Mart employee.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, good.
 <br>
 Have a cupcake.
 <br>
 Mom, did you hear what I said? Uh-huh, and it&#39;s just so very unpleasant, I&#39;m ignoring it.
 <br>
 So, have a cupcake.
 <br>
 Earl is suing Dad for wrongful termination.
 <br>
 Earl? He didn&#39;t do his job.
 <br>
 He was always late.
 <br>
 He was a complete dumb-ass person.
 <br>
 Mom, you said &#34;ass.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, now so did you.
 <br>
 Give me back the cupcake, foul mouth.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even imagine the mood your father&#39;s in.
 <br>
 Actually, he doesn&#39;t know yet.
 <br>
 I got the news after he left.
 <br>
 God, Dad is gonna freak.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know how we&#39;re gonna tell him.
 <br>
 - Tell me what? - That, uh Mom said the &#34;ass&#34; word.
 <br>
 Well, now actually, um Red, um- You know, Mom, I got this one.
 <br>
 Okay, uh, everyone here who&#39;s not being sued by Earl for wrongful termination raise their hand.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t getJackie, man.
 <br>
 I mean, picking Fez over me? Me? I have the three things that women want.
 <br>
 I&#39;m-I&#39;m hot, and I&#39;m smart.
 <br>
 That&#39;s two things, moron.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s three.
 <br>
 I count hot twice.
 <br>
 I mean, come on.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Kelso, who cares? It&#39;s a stupid roller disco thing.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s silly for me to be jealous.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re a good friend, Donna.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause when you think about it, I mean, what does Fez have going for him except an incredibly sexy accent and an extremely hot body? Okay.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re being a bad friend, Donna.
 <br>
 I mean, come to think of it, if Fez helps Jackie win a roller disco she might rip his clothes off and have sex with him right there on the rink.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how hot he is.
 <br>
 Bad friend, Donna! Bad! Oh, look at this guy&#39;s complaint.
 <br>
 &#34;Red Forman was habitually ill-tempered.
 <br>
 &#34; Am I ill-tempered? No, sir.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like Mary Poppins.
 <br>
 Okay, honey.
 <br>
 Well, it says here you have to go to the labor board.
 <br>
 You know what, Red Forman, you have to go in there and defend yourself.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I&#39;ll defend myself.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go in there, and I&#39;ll tell those morons that they&#39;re wasting my time with this stupid crap! Or you could control your temper.
 <br>
 No offense, Mom, but what&#39;s plan &#34;B&#34;? [Chuckles] Hey, shut it, pal.
 <br>
 Okay, now, see, that&#39;s the kind of thing that&#39;s gonna get you in trouble.
 <br>
 Now, when-when I get really angry, I just- I laugh it off like this.
 <br>
 - See? - Oh, geez, Kitty.
 <br>
 That&#39;ll never work.
 <br>
 That&#39;s dumb.
 <br>
 [Disco] [Ends] Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I think Jackie and Fez are next.
 <br>
 Look! There they are! Hey! The next contestants are cheaters.
 <br>
 The brown guy is a robot.
 <br>
 - Robot? Shut up.
 <br>
 - [Man On P.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 ] Ladies and gentleman welcome to the rink our last contestants of the evening- from Point Place, Wisconsin, Jackie Burkhart and, uh Jackie Burkhart&#39;s Partner.
 <br>
 ! Boo! [Disco] This is so cool.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 They&#39;re amazing! - Oh, did you see that? Fez just tripped.
 <br>
 - No, he didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - The foreign guy tripped.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a deduction right there.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna lose! Kelso, shut up.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 They&#39;re doing too well.
 <br>
 [Grunts] What the hell is that? - It&#39;s my secret weapon.
 <br>
 - A marble? Yep.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna chuck it out there so they trip.
 <br>
 You moron, it&#39;s one marble.
 <br>
 - Give me that.
 <br>
 Give me that.
 <br>
 - No! No! [Singing] [Continues] [Ends] Boo! Boo! - Boo! - Whoo! Oh, no.
 <br>
 They were good.
 <br>
 I swallowed my marble.
 <br>
 Boo! - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You guys were so great.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 And even when I almost tripped, my natural grace totally saved us.
 <br>
 Well, I saw plenty of mistakes out there, especially from Fez.
 <br>
 Shut your hole.
 <br>
 - Here come the scores.
 <br>
 - [Drumroll] [Man On P.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 ] And the winner of Kenosha&#39;s Annual Roller Disco Doo-dah is - Jackie Burkhart and- - Oh, my God! - Friend.
 <br>
 - Fix! Fix! I can&#39;t believe it! I&#39;m so sorry I doubted you.
 <br>
 You-You are my hero- my- my hunky, sexy, foreign skating hero! And you are my- my spoiled, whiny skating princess.
 <br>
 Oh, Fez, thank you! - [Gasps] Yea, champagne! Yea! - Yea! - Yea! - Get off me.
 <br>
 Kelso, you booed us the entire time.
 <br>
 What? No! That was some rude guy.
 <br>
 So I popped him one, and then I was goin&#39;, &#34;Ooh,&#34; because I hurt my hand when I popped the rude guy.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 You wanna kiss it? Let&#39;s go, Fez.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Come on, Kelso.
 <br>
 Look at the bright side.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the bright side? The bright side is there isn&#39;t one.
 <br>
 Fez has Jackie, and you have to squeeze out that marble.
 <br>
 Now, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, at any point did you ever berate Earl Arthur by calling him any of the following names: Candy-ass dumb-ass, lazy-ass- Uh, it- it just goes on like that.
 <br>
 Well, that sounds like just good-natured ribbin&#39; to me.
 <br>
 - Doesn&#39;t sound that way to me.
 <br>
 - [Clears Throat] [Laughs] Are you callin&#39; me a liar? &#39;Cause it&#39;s funny if ya are.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Well, you know, Eric worked with him too.
 <br>
 Eric, tell him about Earl.
 <br>
 Actually, I&#39;d be more interested in hearing what Eric thinks about working with you.
 <br>
 Eric? No.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I&#39;m-I&#39;m here just to answer questions about Earl- old, dumb Earl.
 <br>
 So, you know, you fire away with the Earl questions.
 <br>
 I think we know all we need to know about Earl.
 <br>
 Oh, then good.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just step out then.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 - This was good.
 <br>
 - No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 Eric, just a few more questions.
 <br>
 Is your father ever unnecessarily angry? [Chuckles] Unnecessarily angry.
 <br>
 Well- [Clears Throat] you know, what does &#34;unnecessarily&#34; mean really? I mean, my sister likes to put salt on roast beef but I think it&#39;s unnecessary.
 <br>
 I mean, why cover up the flavor of such a delicious meat? Just answer the question, dumb-ass! I mean-[Laughs] Good work, Son.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I love champagne! Yes.
 <br>
 Was it any good? Great.
 <br>
 Just great.
 <br>
 [Gasps] Hey, Fez, I just made up a poem.
 <br>
 - Do you want to hear it? - Okay.
 <br>
 There once was a guy named Fez who had a really cute butt.
 <br>
 Ta-da! Well, I have to say I don&#39;t hate it.
 <br>
 Hey- Psst Fezzie do you want to know a secret? If you try to kiss me right now I probably wouldn&#39;t stop you.
 <br>
 [Giggles] In fact I&#39;d probably let you do more than that.
 <br>
 [Giggles] - Fez- - Huh! Good God, man.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 She is drunk.
 <br>
 But, Batman, she is so hot.
 <br>
 But she&#39;s drunk.
 <br>
 There is no honor in this.
 <br>
 Ah, screw honor.
 <br>
 Take her pants off.
 <br>
 Ay! Riddler, nefarious fiend.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t do it, Fez.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a trap.
 <br>
 Riddle me this, Fez.
 <br>
 Why would Jackie ask you to make out with her if she didn&#39;t want you to? Seriously, he makes an excellent point.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the dastardly alcohol talking.
 <br>
 If you and Jackie get together, you want it to be real, not like this.
 <br>
 Honestly, I was rooting for you but imaginary Batman makes a lot of sense.
 <br>
 Then riddle me this.
 <br>
 What does Batman know about girls? Slides down a pole and lives with a teenage boy.
 <br>
 Enough said.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Now I have to say, advantage Riddler.
 <br>
 What are you trying to say, Riddler? I think you know what I&#39;m trying to say.
 <br>
 Ooh-la-la.
 <br>
 Oh, you want to go, question dork? Oh, bring it on, bat-wuss.
 <br>
 [Grunting] So are you gonna kiss me, Fez? No, I am sorry, Jackie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You still have a very cute butt.
 <br>
 Come on, Kelso.
 <br>
 SoJackie likes Fez.
 <br>
 Big deal.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going out with Laurie.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, you know seeing her with another guy just made me remember all the good times we had together and it just made me sad.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 You know, Kelso I guess underneath it all you&#39;re kind of a good guy.
 <br>
 Sometimes.
 <br>
 Sort of.
 <br>
 - Things&#39;ll work themselves out.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing? We can&#39;t fight these feelings anymore, Donna.
 <br>
 - What? - What? We&#39;ve been doing this dance all night and, oh, God, I&#39;m tired of dancing.
 <br>
 You moron! Nobody likes a tease, Donna! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not a tease.
 <br>
 Come back.
 <br>
 Tease! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Donna! I guess &#34;violent&#34; is the wrong word but, you know, it&#39;s definitely some kind of rage.
 <br>
 Although, I mean, you know, Earl had it coming.
 <br>
 I love you, Daddy.
 <br>
 [Panting] Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Sorry I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 Hour and 10 minutes late.
 <br>
 I can only assume you&#39;re Earl.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 So, um, sorry.
 <br>
 My, uh, dog got hit by a- a guy in a- - Car? - [Snaps Fingers] Thanks, Red.
 <br>
 - So, what&#39;d I miss? - You missed everything.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna lie.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, you- you scare the living hell out of me.
 <br>
 - No offense.
 <br>
 - None taken.
 <br>
 That&#39;s kind of his thing.
 <br>
 [Laughs] But, Earl, in light of your failure to show up for your own hearing we have no choice but to rule in favor of Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 - Yes, sir! - Way to go, Dad! Damn dog.
 <br>
 And Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, even though this hearing did go your way today in light of some of your son&#39;s responses I would strongly encourage you to go to anger management classes.
 <br>
 Sure, I&#39;ll- I&#39;ll do that.
 <br>
 Neat! Anger management- That sounds like it could be kind of fun, right? [Laughs] We-We won.
 <br>
 Hey! You and me- We&#39;re such a good team.
 <br>
 Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah.
 <br>
 We did it.
 <br>
 How about us, huh? Stickin&#39; it to the man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll see you at home.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 But, Dad, we- we drove here together.
 <br>
 Then she fell asleep, and I stroke her hair.
 <br>
 You did the right thing, Fez, but a word of advice.
 <br>
 Next time you tell the story, ya nailed her.
 <br>
 Yeah, but, you know, it&#39;s better you didn&#39;t &#39;cause scammin&#39; on another guy&#39;s woman- That&#39;s totally breaking the code.
 <br>
 Donna told me what you did, you dill-hole! No, she&#39;s lying! [Shouting] Oh! That&#39;s my nipple! [Grunting, Shouting] Hello buttercup.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re drunk.
 <br>
 Madam, I may be drunk, but you should have sex with me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 But you have to, because last night I made a big mistake.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even remember last night.
 <br>
 Ay!
 <br>
