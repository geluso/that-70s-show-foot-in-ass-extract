<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So get this, I got fired! I&#39;d never thought I&#39;d say this but apparently I&#39;m not good enough for the dog food factory.
 <br>
 I thought you&#39;d say that.
 <br>
 Honey, don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll get along fine without your paycheck.
 <br>
 Instead of going to the movies, we&#39;ll watch TV.
 <br>
 Instead of eating popcorn, we&#39;ll lick salt.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like, why would Joanne fire me? Bob she&#39;s your girlfriend, did she say anything? Eric, ixnay on oanne-jay.
 <br>
 Donna, you know I don&#39;t understand Pig Latin.
 <br>
 Bob, what is Joanne&#39;s problem? Eric, ixnay means shut up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay, honey.
 <br>
 I can talk about it.
 <br>
 Me and Joanne broke up.
 <br>
 And-- and I didn&#39;t see it coming.
 <br>
 Bob, what did I tell you last week? Don&#39;t cry in your kitchen? And I didn&#39;t mean just that day.
 <br>
 I meant always.
 <br>
 I better go then.
 <br>
 Nice going.
 <br>
 Ackass-jay Ackass-jay?! Oh Jackass! Well, honey, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a jackass.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;re a jack-angel.
 <br>
 Hey Mom, look, I know you&#39;re worried about money with Dad not being able to work.
 <br>
 But I want you to know, I&#39;m gonna go right back out there and get a a better job, a high paying job.
 <br>
 Well sure, just go down to the Bureau of High Paying Jobs.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t miss it, it&#39;s right next to the Pie-in-the-Sky Office.
 <br>
 Jackass! Oh really? Thank you.
 <br>
 Well the job search is going great.
 <br>
 I think I have a shot at washing an old man&#39;s back on tuesdays and thursdays.
 <br>
 They were looking for a waiter down at the restaurant.
 <br>
 Whoa, why&#39;d you tell him, I&#39;m up for that job.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I told him.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 Look, Eric, I need this job way more than you do.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have a baby on the way.
 <br>
 But I do have a family to support.
 <br>
 And-- if I don&#39;t keep the booze flowing, they&#39;re going to get violent.
 <br>
 Well, look the only way Brooke&#39;s going to let me be a part of my kid&#39;s life is if I prove to her that I&#39;m responsible.
 <br>
 A promotion at the restaurant would impress her.
 <br>
 And, I mean busboy is a job but waiter is a career.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well then, you know what.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll just both go down there, apply and may the best man win.
 <br>
 No, I want it.
 <br>
 Season 6 Episode 6 We&#39;re Not Gonna Take It Laurie! Well look what the whore dragged in.
 <br>
 Herself.
 <br>
 Need I remind you that you are married.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 The guy from last night was married too.
 <br>
 What is your problem? Are you two at it again? Your green card is on the way, I thought this marriage was over.
 <br>
 Laurie, I gave you $50 last week to go down to the court house and file for divorce.
 <br>
 What happened? Well I had to get a new make up mirror and some wine.
 <br>
 Tomorrow we&#39;re going to the court house.
 <br>
 Hmm, the court house is across town.
 <br>
 I wonder if you can make it all the way there without sleeping with someone.
 <br>
 I bet I can make it there without sleeping with you.
 <br>
 Bitch! Bob? What are you doin&#39; here, anyway? Oh, it&#39;s just something I&#39;m trying out.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it goin&#39;? It&#39;s a little uncomfortable.
 <br>
 I thought it&#39;ll be better than sitting home alone.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not.
 <br>
 Oh, my poor dad.
 <br>
 I wish there was something I can do to make him feel better.
 <br>
 Well, once when I was sad, when Michael was cheating on me I got flowers from a secret admirer, and it cheered me right up.
 <br>
 I mean, sure I send them to myself.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s the thought that counts.
 <br>
 Those flowers were from you? You let me go on and on about how they were from me.
 <br>
 God, try a little honesty! Wait.
 <br>
 That&#39;s actually not a bad idea.
 <br>
 If my dad thought somebody else likes him, he wouldn&#39;t be so bummed about Joanne.
 <br>
 But men don&#39;t really like flowers, do they? No, they remind as of bees.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;ll send him fudge.
 <br>
 He loves fudge.
 <br>
 I know because one time he got some and I asked if I can have a piece, and he quickly changed the subject.
 <br>
 Well, let me tell them what to write in the card.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good at that.
 <br>
 When I sent myself those flowers and read how much I love me, I felt so much better.
 <br>
 Hey, Roy, remember me? I&#39;m Eric Forman.
 <br>
 - Oh hey, how are you? - I&#39;m here to apply for the waiter position.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Roy that&#39;s the guy I was telling you about.
 <br>
 Ohh Well, I don&#39;t think we can hire a waiter who&#39;s got a disease that spreads through food.
 <br>
 Roy, he really doesn&#39;t like to talk about his death-a-food-a-spreaditis.
 <br>
 Death-a-food-a-spread-a-what? Who are you? Elmer Fudd? All right fine, he doesn&#39;t have a disease.
 <br>
 I just-- I really want the job, Roy.
 <br>
 Well I wish I could give it to both of you.
 <br>
 I mean Eric&#39;s got that Zippy personality and Kelso&#39;s old man.
 <br>
 I know what we should do.
 <br>
 We should make it a competition.
 <br>
 That way, there&#39;s the fun of someone losing.
 <br>
 Okay, everybody, let&#39;s put some smiles on those faces.
 <br>
 We&#39;re goin&#39; to get divorced.
 <br>
 What the hell&#39;s this? Looks like a box.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s a box.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s with the attitude? I&#39;m just making conversation looks like a box, it is a box.
 <br>
 This is how real people talk, man.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s a present.
 <br>
 Ooh, it&#39;s a wedding present from Aunt Martha! You told her about the marriage? We agreed never to speak of this evil to anyone! Well, I had to tell a few people because I never thought I&#39;d be able to say &#34;Laurie got married&#34; without adding &#34;and the baby came early&#34;.
 <br>
 Ooh, look at the paper sparkle! I wonder what it is.
 <br>
 Well keep wondering &#39;cause this package is going right back.
 <br>
 - But Daddy! - But Daddy! No, no, I-- I&#39;m just curious Aunt Martha&#39;s well to do.
 <br>
 So you have to figure, it&#39;s a pretty nice present.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you want to just peek? No, I want to go to the court house.
 <br>
 Now get moving.
 <br>
 Whatever&#39;s in this package might make you happy for a day, but a divorce is a gift that lasts a lifetime.
 <br>
 Guess what girls? I got fudge.
 <br>
 Fudge? What a surprise! Who is it from? It doesn&#39;t say.
 <br>
 But there&#39;s a poem.
 <br>
 &#34;Roses are red Violets are blue Fudge is sweet Here&#39;s some fudge.
 <br>
 &#34; Wha-- they rushed me.
 <br>
 I wonder who it&#39;s from, &#39;cause it sounds like someone likes you.
 <br>
 I hope it&#39;s a lady.
 <br>
 Hello! Oh, hi Joanne.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Joanne.
 <br>
 Really? Well I think it&#39;s a little late to talk about getting back together it turns out, I&#39;m very desirable.
 <br>
 So I think this is goodbye.
 <br>
 Oh, and I want my Barry White albums back and my body paints.
 <br>
 Oh my God! I know they painted each other! Ugh! Eric, you&#39;re first.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna test you on the skills every waiter should have.
 <br>
 Roy, I want you to know that because of my extensive background in crafts I can fold a napkin into a rose, a swan and the rarely seen, X-wing Fighter.
 <br>
 - Cool! - I know.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m gonna place a difficult order and you&#39;ll relay it to Steven in the kitchen.
 <br>
 Here it goes.
 <br>
 Surf and turf, no seafood.
 <br>
 Meat, nice and pink.
 <br>
 Mashed potatoes, not mashed.
 <br>
 Sliced into wedges and fried up.
 <br>
 Okay, so steak, medium rare and french fries.
 <br>
 Okay I&#39;m gonna need #4, still kickin&#39;, hold the guppy and send it to France.
 <br>
 And that is how you do that.
 <br>
 Surf and turf, no seafood.
 <br>
 Meat, nice and pink.
 <br>
 Mashed potatoes, not mashed.
 <br>
 Sliced into wedges and fried up.
 <br>
 One cheese burger.
 <br>
 It&#39;s very important that a waiter can deal with difficult costumers.
 <br>
 Steven and I are gonna play a married couple.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not so into this Roy.
 <br>
 Excuse me waiter, uh, this wine is no good.
 <br>
 It&#39;s our anniversary and I want everything to be perfect.
 <br>
 God knows it&#39;s hard enough just to get him out of the house.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m very sorry madam if you&#39;ll allow me to bring you a complimentary bottle of our finest wine I&#39;d be most obliged.
 <br>
 Most obliged? That&#39;s Shakespeare.
 <br>
 Waiter! Uh, it&#39;s our anniversary and this wine is no good.
 <br>
 Yeah, you got a lot more problems than the wine.
 <br>
 You are one ugly broad.
 <br>
 I do not appreciate your tone.
 <br>
 My tone? Dude your wife&#39;s a bitch! Okay.
 <br>
 Work your way around the tables with a tray full of dishes without spilling or dropping anything.
 <br>
 And for God&#39;s sake, watch out for the baby.
 <br>
 Go! Ten bucks says his skinny little wrist snaps under the weight.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take that bet.
 <br>
 He&#39;s scrawny, but strong.
 <br>
 Like the Vietcong.
 <br>
 So Like when does this test start? All right.
 <br>
 Oh, what&#39;s this? Roy, I think you might have left a 20 dollar bill tucked in my sleeve.
 <br>
 I&#39;m always losing stuff.
 <br>
 But-- No Roy, that was And, go! Well Eric, you&#39;re hired.
 <br>
 Oh really? Roy, this is like a dream.
 <br>
 Uh A really mediocre dream.
 <br>
 All right everybody only twelve signatures to the end of what I like to call the shame.
 <br>
 Still there and it calls to me.
 <br>
 Like a box with something mysterious in it.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing like a present wrapped in beautiful paper.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like Cary Grant in a tuxedo.
 <br>
 I just want to rip it off.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t touch it! I&#39;m not I&#39;m smelling it.
 <br>
 What does it smell like? A box.
 <br>
 - I hope it&#39;s a sewing machine.
 <br>
 - I hope it&#39;s a TV.
 <br>
 I hope it&#39;s a a chocolate TV.
 <br>
 There could be perishables in there.
 <br>
 Oh my God! What if it&#39;s a puppy? We have to open it.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care if Eric&#39;s in there.
 <br>
 It&#39;s going back.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s get this signed.
 <br>
 - Look right here, paper&#39;s ripped.
 <br>
 - Oh my gosh, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 I see part of a word, moore and under that, something cro Moore Cro Moore Cro It&#39;s a Kenmoore Microwave! I win! I win! Hey.
 <br>
 Hyde, where&#39;s table seven&#39;s fish? Oh, I got that for you Eric.
 <br>
 Here is your Fillet of Sole.
 <br>
 Ohh Burn! All right Eric, here&#39;s the pea soup you ordered.
 <br>
 You peed in this soup, didn&#39;t you? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m done trying to screw you over.
 <br>
 All right bud.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not your fault you got the job some people are busboy, and some people are waiters.
 <br>
 And guess I&#39;m just an extremely handsome busboy.
 <br>
 Roy that extremely handsome busboy just broke my heart.
 <br>
 I really don&#39;t think he&#39;d peed in the soup, Eric.
 <br>
 Look, couldn&#39;t you find another waiter job for him? He needs a break, he&#39;s got a baby on the way.
 <br>
 Well, there might be a job opening up &#39;cause Jeannie said she&#39;d quit if I don&#39;t stop asking her out.
 <br>
 Come on, I&#39;m not gonna stop asking her out.
 <br>
 So if I really work hard with Kelso will you give him another tryout? Sure.
 <br>
 But I really don&#39;t think he can handle it and my standards for food service are really low.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t washed my hands in four days.
 <br>
 - Dad-- - Too late, I finished it.
 <br>
 So, I was trying to figure out who sent me the fudge and I thought, it could be the lady at the pharmacy.
 <br>
 Which is nice because she&#39;s seen my prescriptions so we can skip that awkward conversation.
 <br>
 Or it could be the mail lady.
 <br>
 Dad, I have to tell you something.
 <br>
 Jackie and I sent you the fudge.
 <br>
 What? Well you seemed so sad that we wanted to cheer you up.
 <br>
 But then we screwed your chance of getting back together with Joanne, so So nobody likes me.
 <br>
 We like you! Eh We&#39;re really sorry, Dad.
 <br>
 I guess it&#39;s not so bad.
 <br>
 I mean I haven&#39;t thought about Joanne all day.
 <br>
 Well if you want we can all do something today.
 <br>
 I could take you to the model train shop.
 <br>
 Some of the tiny trees in Pinciotti Town are looking pretty ratty.
 <br>
 Nah, I&#39;m gonna go down and talk to the girl at the pharmacy.
 <br>
 She&#39;s got a better keister than the mail lady.
 <br>
 You&#39;d think with all that walkin&#39; Hey, guess you either got it or you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Guys, give it up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna be able to do this.
 <br>
 Hey! That&#39;s not the Kelso I know.
 <br>
 A lot of people said couldn&#39;t fit and who proved them wrong? I did.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right! And a lot of people said you couldn&#39;t make out with both of the Ziegler twins on the same night and who proved them wrong? I did! Oh, and I also brushed your mom&#39;s boob at a bake sale so actually it was a three-fer.
 <br>
 Exactly! You are Michael Kelso.
 <br>
 Right? You make the impossible happen.
 <br>
 Now come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do this! Okay.
 <br>
 Ready.
 <br>
 Get set.
 <br>
 Kelso! What?! Good luck.
 <br>
 Ah! What a beautiful morning! The birds are singing.
 <br>
 The flowers are blooming.
 <br>
 Divorce is in the air.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s finish this.
 <br>
 Red, no one wants to get divorced on an empty stomach.
 <br>
 Ooh, and that&#39;s breakfast! You used the microwave! Red Forman, I firmly believe that God wants me to bake a potato in four minutes.
 <br>
 No, God wants these two divorced and all evidence of their unholy union out of this house.
 <br>
 We got another present.
 <br>
 No, no! Don&#39;t open it &#39;cause we&#39;re not keeping it.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Look at that saw! It&#39;s from Billy Schneider down at the hardware store.
 <br>
 He&#39;s had a crush on me since I went ladder shopping in that miniskirt.
 <br>
 Okay, just to make it clear.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re buying me a gift I want candy.
 <br>
 For my birthday, christmas, daylight savings-- candy.
 <br>
 Candy! Now, you can have the saw, Red.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I that would be, uh wrong.
 <br>
 Well.
 <br>
 It would be wrong if they were divorced.
 <br>
 But if they stayed married, sending the gifts back would be rude.
 <br>
 You make a good point! But I want a divorce.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you what, honey.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll wait a month.
 <br>
 If a riding mower hasn&#39;t shown up by then, we&#39;ll talk.
 <br>
 Okay, remember, buddy.
 <br>
 The tray is like a lady.
 <br>
 Dance with her.
 <br>
 And, go! I did it! Congratulations! You got the job.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait to tell Brooke! - Hey.
 <br>
 Welcome to the exclusive ranks of waiter at a crappy hotel restaurant.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe that I did it.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe the glue held.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Super Glue kicks ass! You know what Kelso.
 <br>
 Your first shift is not gonna go well.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s gonna be a disaster! &#34;Warning: Never put metal in the microwave&#34; This isn&#39;t metal, it is soup.
 <br>
 Miss Kitty! Eric broke the microwave! Season 6 Episode 6 We&#39;re Not Gonna Take It
