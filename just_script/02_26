 Okay.
 <br>
 You guys I just got an advance copy of the yearbook and you&#39;ll all be happy to know that 1977 is my cutest year ever.
 <br>
 Jackie, that is so weird because I was just telling the gang how there&#39;s no way you could be cuter than last year.
 <br>
 - You were? - Yes.
 <br>
 I, for one, totally believe that you are cuter this year.
 <br>
 Yeah, since I dumped you.
 <br>
 Nice burn.
 <br>
 Donna, we&#39;ve talked about that.
 <br>
 Hey, Steven.
 <br>
 Want to pop some popcorn and look at all the yearbook pictures of me? Nah, I figure I&#39;ll do plenty of that when I die and go to hell.
 <br>
 God, you&#39;re such a card.
 <br>
 This is so exciting.
 <br>
 My first American yearbook.
 <br>
 Show us some pictures of Fez.
 <br>
 Sorry, Fez.
 <br>
 There aren&#39;t any.
 <br>
 What the hell? So, they don&#39;t let foreigners in your yearbook? Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s me cheering at the pep rally last fall.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! Someone in the crowd is mooning.
 <br>
 You&#39;re all cheering away, and the whole time you&#39;re getting mooned.
 <br>
 Yeah! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a girl butt.
 <br>
 Hee-hee.
 <br>
 There&#39;s girl butt in the yearbook.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t tell who it is.
 <br>
 I wish we had a magnifying glass.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 I I was just playing with some bugs.
 <br>
 God, I can&#39;t believe it.
 <br>
 Someone&#39;s nasty butt is in my picture.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not girl butt.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s Donna&#39;s butt.
 <br>
 - Yes, it is! Eric.
 <br>
 Are you okay? &#39;Cause you look weird.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Could it be because of your girlfriend&#39;s naked butt? - Kelso, you&#39;re not helping.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not trying to help.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 It is too, Donna.
 <br>
 Your nasty butt ruined my picture.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Maybe your nasty face ruined my butt picture.
 <br>
 I know why I&#39;m not in the yearbook.
 <br>
 It&#39;s because whitey&#39;s keeping me down.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 Just look at Donna&#39;s naked butt some more.
 <br>
 Yes, that&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Donna, take me through the chain of events.
 <br>
 Now, uh, you&#39;re at the pep rally Oh.
 <br>
 And at this point your pants are on.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 And then they weren&#39;t.
 <br>
 Donna, mooning&#39;s not something you just do.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not something you just do because it&#39;s impossible to moon when you have no ass.
 <br>
 Michael is such a boy.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t even know who he is.
 <br>
 You know who knows who he is? Steven Hyde.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Now you like Hyde? No, I don&#39;t like him.
 <br>
 I just I just think he&#39;s, like, the sweetest, coolest guy I&#39;ve ever met.
 <br>
 Jackie, I thought you hated him.
 <br>
 Feelings change, Donna.
 <br>
 Like, remember when we first met, and I hated you? - What? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I thought you were, like, this big goon.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t we have this talk? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I mean, I hated you too.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s &#39;cause you were a big goon.
 <br>
 - Bitch.
 <br>
 - Goon.
 <br>
 - Bitch! - Goon! See? See, we&#39;re closer then ever.
 <br>
 I gotta go find Steven.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hello, strangers.
 <br>
 Look, Red.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the Pinciottis.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And they&#39;re dressed the same.
 <br>
 We were jogging.
 <br>
 So you had to dress the same? Well, I hope we&#39;re still on for cards tomorrow night.
 <br>
 Oh, about that.
 <br>
 Uh, we can&#39;t Hey.
 <br>
 No excuses necessary.
 <br>
 Gosh.
 <br>
 Darn the luck.
 <br>
 That just makes me so sad.
 <br>
 I gotta go inside.
 <br>
 Well, me too.
 <br>
 Um, Midge, is something bothering Bob? Oh, he&#39;s uncomfortable around you and Red now that Donna and Eric know each other.
 <br>
 If you know what I mean.
 <br>
 You see, I&#39;m using the word &#34;know&#34; in a different way here.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a pun.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a Okay, Midge.
 <br>
 Good pun.
 <br>
 Bye-bye now.
 <br>
 Oh, they are nuts.
 <br>
 Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of things about Steven that I used to not like that now I really like.
 <br>
 Like Well, I thought his pork-chop sideburns were a sign that he was poor and dirty and lived in a shack.
 <br>
 But then But then I realized that Elvis had sideburns, and he lived in Graceland.
 <br>
 Well, that was an eye-opener.
 <br>
 There he is.
 <br>
 Hi, Steven.
 <br>
 What&#39;s she doing here? I think she&#39;s hitting on me, man.
 <br>
 But I ain&#39;t interested.
 <br>
 Tell her I ain&#39;t interested and make her go away.
 <br>
 Hitting on you? I&#39;m not hitting on you, you relic.
 <br>
 Hey, name-calling&#39;s no way to win someone&#39;s heart.
 <br>
 - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Great.
 <br>
 Now he got away.
 <br>
 Steven! What was she talking about? Man, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into Jackie.
 <br>
 &#34;Steven, let&#39;s hang out.
 <br>
 Steven, let&#39;s go to the mall.
 <br>
 &#34; My life&#39;s a living hell, you know.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re hilarious! You know, Steven and I tease each other.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what best friends do.
 <br>
 You know what? I love showing my butt! I don&#39;t care what Eric says.
 <br>
 I like to show it, and I like to shake it.
 <br>
 Donna, I can totally respect that.
 <br>
 Just be careful, though, or they&#39;ll call you a home-wrecker.
 <br>
 I can count the number of homes I&#39;ve wrecked on one hand.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry, ladies, &#39;cause no one&#39;s gonna label you here.
 <br>
 If you guys want to take off some clothes and shake some stuff, feel free.
 <br>
 Not you.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t call you a home-wrecker, Laurie.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;d call you a slut.
 <br>
 And a home-wrecker.
 <br>
 Shake, shake, shake Shake, shake, shake Shake your booty Whoo! Rock it, girl.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good stuff.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see a smile.
 <br>
 After all, no card game with the Looney Tunes tonight.
 <br>
 Red, they are the only friends we&#39;ve got.
 <br>
 I am having them over tonight, so we can clear the air.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to clear the air.
 <br>
 Red, I&#39;m clearing the air.
 <br>
 Kitty, this is our chance to grow apart.
 <br>
 How can you throw that away? How? Because six nights a week I have to stare at your sour puss and even God got to rest one day a week.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 So, the yearbooks are out, and no one&#39;s noticed your fleshy indiscretion.
 <br>
 So I guess I&#39;m cool with it.
 <br>
 What a relief.
 <br>
 I tossed and turned all night.
 <br>
 Well Relax, Donna.
 <br>
 Relax.
 <br>
 Because, I mean, it&#39;s a tiny picture.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all out of focus.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s safe to say this little episode is behind us now.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody.
 <br>
 Donna showed her ass! Donna showed her ass! Donna showed her ass! Donna showed her ass! Donna showed her ass! Okay.
 <br>
 Um We&#39;ve been friends and neighbors for a long time and, um, I think there&#39;s something we need to talk about.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t you, Bob? - Nope.
 <br>
 Kitty, don&#39;t push him.
 <br>
 He might just get up and leave.
 <br>
 I&#39;d respect you if you got up and left.
 <br>
 Eric and Donna are having sex.
 <br>
 - What the hell? - Kitty! I didn&#39;t know that &#34;clearing the air&#34; meant we were gonna have a sex talk with the neighbors.
 <br>
 I did.
 <br>
 And I thought it was gonna be fun.
 <br>
 And it is fun! I think what Midge means is it&#39;s good to clear the air.
 <br>
 Secrets cause cancer.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Bring it on.
 <br>
 Just so long as I don&#39;t have to talk about this.
 <br>
 I gotta say I&#39;m with Bob on this.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 So let&#39;s all just not talk.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Deal.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Deal, buddy.
 <br>
 No, Bob.
 <br>
 Deal.
 <br>
 You lose again, cracker.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you go home and cry to your big white mama? Well, first of all, dude, I think I&#39;m Chinese.
 <br>
 And second of all, let me see you put your money where your mouth is.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Twenty bucks.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to dip into my babysitting money.
 <br>
 I mean my drag-racing money.
 <br>
 Time to lose, little white girls.
 <br>
 Score.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 Hey, I just remembered, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really good at this game.
 <br>
 Ooh, Steven.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Jackie, please.
 <br>
 I&#39;m right in the middle of &#34;Smokey and the Band-Aid,&#34; okay? Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But I signed us up for roller-disco lessons at Skate World tonight.
 <br>
 Class starts in half an hour, so we better hustle.
 <br>
 You get it? &#34;Hustle&#34;? Okay, let me explain something to you.
 <br>
 On Friday nights, I don&#39;t roller-disco.
 <br>
 I go out looking for roller-discoers to punch in the head.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We won&#39;t roller-disco.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll do anything you want.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 We won&#39;t.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Man You and I don&#39;t have anything in common.
 <br>
 You&#39;re, like, a square, you know? A A cheerleader.
 <br>
 So, just roller-disco on out of here, okay? Fine.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I guess I&#39;m not cool enough to hang out with you anymore.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re getting it.
 <br>
 You know what, Steven? You think you know me, but you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know me at all.
 <br>
 I know you like unicorns.
 <br>
 So, bye-bye.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Call Walter Cronkite.
 <br>
 My girlfriend has her pants on.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re behaving like the biggest baby.
 <br>
 What&#39;s your problem? What&#39;s my My problem is it&#39;s your butt.
 <br>
 It&#39;s our butt.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my butt.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s my butt.
 <br>
 And when I showed it, it was funny.
 <br>
 And you should be glad that you have a girlfriend who&#39;s cool enough to moon.
 <br>
 Well Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re right, but You know what? Once the jocks and the guys with the Firebirds see it you know, they&#39;re just gonna totally want you.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 With my weak-willed girlie mind, I&#39;ll go too.
 <br>
 You&#39;re such a bonehead.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 Okay, it&#39;s great.
 <br>
 But, you know, in the future would it kill you just to have a smidgen of modesty? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 What What&#39;s so funny? You&#39;re a prude.
 <br>
 I am not.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 You&#39;re uptight.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like a little pilgrim.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
 <br>
 In the end, I&#39;m glad my Donna&#39;s with your Eric.
 <br>
 At least I know Eric&#39;s not a degenerate.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s the prude now, huh? My ass is swingin&#39;, baby! Whoo! Eric.
 <br>
 Hi, Mom.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Bob, uh, you want to go ahead and cancel next week&#39;s game, buddy? Okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a tie game.
 <br>
 This is it, Fez.
 <br>
 Channel all of your hatred for the white man into this one last point.
 <br>
 I am full of hate, my brother.
 <br>
 Hey, foreign guy.
 <br>
 Will you sign your yearbook picture? My what book picture? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 It is half my face.
 <br>
 Oh, I feel the warm, loving embrace of the whitey.
 <br>
 I forfeit.
 <br>
 You win.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 No one is embracing you, Fez.
 <br>
 You&#39;re brown, okay? So let&#39;s kick some racist ass! We lost? Nice game, my white friends.
 <br>
 You owe me money! Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Is the roller-disco craze over already? Of course not.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Hyde.
 <br>
 I just wanted you to know that I&#39;m not a square cheerleader.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on the wrong side of the law.
 <br>
 Because I have this.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 A paper bag.
 <br>
 Run.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I bought it in the ghetto.
 <br>
 Jackie, there is no ghetto here.
 <br>
 I mean, there&#39;s, like, that one house that needs to be painted.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 I bought it from my housekeeper.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 So, what are you saying? You want to be like a burnout now? No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Hyde, I just want to be with you.
 <br>
 Okay? I think you&#39;re one of the coolest, sweetest guys I&#39;ve ever met.
 <br>
 - No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Yes, I do.
 <br>
 Is there a problem here? No, sir, Officer.
 <br>
 There&#39;s, uh There&#39;s no problem at all.
 <br>
 - Right, Jackie? - There&#39;s nothing in the bag.
 <br>
 Okay, miss.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t go to jail.
 <br>
 I have to cheer tomorrow.
 <br>
 What are you doing, man? The bag is mine.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Cheerleader, dirtbag.
 <br>
 Okay, man.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Steven Hyde, you were right.
 <br>
 We will never be friends.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be more than friends.
 <br>
 Because now I love you! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Would you shut up? As God is my witness, I will wait for you.
 <br>
 Well, I hope you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think Bob will ever recover from the sight of your rear end.
 <br>
 What rear end? What I can&#39;t figure out is how you expected to run away with your pants down around your ankles.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 He&#39;s dumb.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Steven, where have you been? You missed the funniest damn thing.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Pants around the ankles? Oh, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Look, Red.
 <br>
 I gotta talk to you about something.
 <br>
 Arrested? For what? For possession of what? Son of a bitch! Hyde got arrested? For what? - For holding.
 <br>
 - For holding what? For holding my heart.
 <br>
 - Because I love him.
 <br>
 - What? It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I love Steven Hyde.
 <br>
 And someday he&#39;ll love me.
 <br>
 And he&#39;ll cut off those stupid sideburns, and we&#39;ll live happily ever after.
 <br>
 What?
 <br>
