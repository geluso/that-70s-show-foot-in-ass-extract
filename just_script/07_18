<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Man, I am so psyched for this auto show.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling you, once I trick out my el camino, it is going to be bad freakin&#39; ass.
 <br>
 You know, &#34;tricking out&#34; sounds a lot like accessorizing.
 <br>
 Hey, don&#39;t ever call it that, all right ? But, yeah, that&#39;s basically what it is.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;m begging you to stop.
 <br>
 There&#39;s gonna be hundreds of auto parts salesmen, and now that I have the muffler shop, they&#39;re gonna be getting in line to kiss my butt.
 <br>
 Well, and they will be happy to kiss it because everything from my house is spotless.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;m getting in the car, I&#39;m counting to 60, and if you&#39;re not there, I&#39;m leaving.
 <br>
 Ah, the honeymoon speech again.
 <br>
 Whoops.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t forget my book.
 <br>
 You know, this new jackie collins romance really gives me a case of the tingles.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, please, your tingles are your own business.
 <br>
 You move into my house, you hear about my tingles.
 <br>
 Jackie, I hope you brought a book.
 <br>
 When we get to the auto show, the guys are gonna ignore us.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I&#39;m a beautiful girl with a shrill, demanding voice.
 <br>
 I&#39;m pretty hard to ignore.
 <br>
 Okay, but we can&#39;t compete with a bunch of cars.
 <br>
 Wheels are like bosoms to men, and a car has four.
 <br>
 I&#39;m getting better.
 <br>
 Leo, check it out.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my baby ! oh, this is brooke.
 <br>
 Oh, isn&#39;t she adorable ? Yeah.
 <br>
 I can see why you knocked her up.
 <br>
 Michael, thanks again for watching betsy.
 <br>
 Everyone else was busy.
 <br>
 Thanks for trusting me.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my first time.
 <br>
 I&#39;m pretty nervous.
 <br>
 I tried on three outfits.
 <br>
 No, you guys will be great.
 <br>
 All little girls love their daddies.
 <br>
 Plus I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll probably like a lot of the same toys.
 <br>
 Ooh, I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 Oh, yes.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Ohh ! Bye-bye, betsy-pie.
 <br>
 Mommy loves you.
 <br>
 - Yes, she does, yes, she does.
 <br>
 - All right, hand her over.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re so attached.
 <br>
 Just - oh look, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 All she does is sleep.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like taking care of a bowling ball.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like bowling, man.
 <br>
 You throw the ball down there, and it keeps coming back.
 <br>
 It&#39;s spooky, man.
 <br>
 Okay, donna, I&#39;ve just spent the last ten minutes cologning and powdering myself.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s spill&#39;em and feel &#39;em.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t, because fez is here.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here, and you can&#39;T.
 <br>
 Fez, buddy, come on.
 <br>
 You of all people should understand how important sex is to a man.
 <br>
 Why should you do it if I can&#39;t ? Because I have a girlfriend.
 <br>
 Why should you have a girlfriend if I can&#39;t ? Okay, how are we gonna work this out ? Give her to me.
 <br>
 Guys, check it out.
 <br>
 Brooke finally let me take care of betsy.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna stay here for the day, okay ? No.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Donna and i have a do-it day planned.
 <br>
 Yeah, and I think I got a piece of this.
 <br>
 Look, why don&#39;t you do it at your house ? I can&#39;T.
 <br>
 My brother&#39;s friends are over there, and they&#39;re playing darts, and they don&#39;t use a dartboard.
 <br>
 They just run around and throw &#39;em at each other.
 <br>
 Okay, donna, I&#39;m going go upstairs and change into something sexy.
 <br>
 Now either you come join me in 60 seconds, or I&#39;m gonna have to start without you, and we both know how awkward it is when you walk in on that.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this ? That&#39;s breast milk.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t touch it.
 <br>
 Breast milk ? From real breasts ? What don&#39;t they do ? Kelso, she&#39;s so adorable.
 <br>
 why is she making that weird face ? - it&#39;s poo ! - it&#39;s poo ! It smells in there, too ! It&#39;s everywhere ! That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 18 &#34;Oh, Baby (We Got A Good Thing Goin&#39; )&#34; We have to dispose of the dirty diaper.
 <br>
 Shark.
 <br>
 Shark.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 What do you want me to do with it ? Just chuck it.
 <br>
 What about the shark ? Chuck it.
 <br>
 Chuck it all.
 <br>
 why is she still crying? We just changed her.
 <br>
 Maybe she doesn&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 Ah, baby burn.
 <br>
 no.
 <br>
 I know what it is.
 <br>
 We left her teddy bear at my house.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get it.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Um aren&#39;t you gonna take her with you ? No.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t take betsy in my car.
 <br>
 I took out the seat belts to make it go faster.
 <br>
 Okay, don&#39;t grab those.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not your mommy.
 <br>
 Yeah, a lady once said that to me on the bus.
 <br>
 Well, it wasn&#39;t a lady.
 <br>
 It was more like a man-lady.
 <br>
 It&#39;s hard to tell sometimes, you know ? Why tell this story, fez ? Why ? yeah, man, look at this place.
 <br>
 Chrome, tires, half-dressed women it&#39;s like sunday dinner at my grandma&#39;s house.
 <br>
 All right, salesmen, pucker up.
 <br>
 Red forman&#39;s ass is in the building.
 <br>
 Okay, well, mine&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 I give yours about 30 seconds.
 <br>
 All right, jackie, so let&#39;s start off looking at new tires, then after lunch, you can help me pick out an obnoxiously loud car stereo.
 <br>
 Wait, you&#39;re gonna spend the day with jackie ? Yeah, man.
 <br>
 She&#39;s my chick.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;m gonna go get us a funnel cake.
 <br>
 But listen, this is a rough crowd, all right ? So if any guys come up to you and offer to teach you how to drive a stick, just say no and pull the fire alarm.
 <br>
 Told ya he wouldn&#39;t ditch me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m his &#34;chick.
 <br>
 &#34; Jackie, he&#39;s a man.
 <br>
 Accept the fact that he is not coming back.
 <br>
 When I was in labor, red went to get me ice chips.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t see him for an hour and a half because he found a pinball machine.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Ha.
 <br>
 I laugh about it now.
 <br>
 I do.
 <br>
 I will.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just not that funny.
 <br>
 I think she&#39;s out.
 <br>
 Well, in that case eric, we can&#39;t do that with her in here.
 <br>
 What ? Come on.
 <br>
 She&#39;s fast asleep.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s been over a week for us.
 <br>
 Donna, you can only keep the tiger in its cage for so long.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m callin&#39; it a tiger now.
 <br>
 crap, the baby&#39;s awake.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 Hey, betsy.
 <br>
 Close your eyes, &#39;cause aunt donna and uncle eric are gonna do it.
 <br>
 Eric, you are seriously disturbed.
 <br>
 We have to take care of her.
 <br>
 No, no, come on.
 <br>
 She&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t put the tiger back in his cage now, donna.
 <br>
 He&#39;s all agitated.
 <br>
 How can a crying baby not turn you off ? Two words, donna eight teen.
 <br>
 - Nothing turns me off.
 <br>
 - Yeah ? Hey, fez.
 <br>
 Why are you staring at that milk ? It&#39;s from a breast.
 <br>
 Simply remarkable.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re clearly a demented pervert, so let me ask you something.
 <br>
 Would you be able to have sex with a baby in the room ? No way.
 <br>
 I can barely do it with a woman in the room.
 <br>
 Congratulations, eric.
 <br>
 You&#39;re more despicable sexually than fez.
 <br>
 Okay, donna, here&#39;s the thing, I&#39;m a man, so my on/off switch is always on.
 <br>
 Now you can either deal with that or you can switch to girls.
 <br>
 Donna, if that&#39;s your baby, I&#39;m gonna snap eric in half.
 <br>
 Dad, don&#39;t you think you woulda noticed if I was pregnant ? Not really.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not that hands-on of a dad.
 <br>
 Anyhoo, I bought a hammock and put it up in the den &#39;cause it&#39;s too cold outside.
 <br>
 Now I need someone to push me.
 <br>
 Sure, I&#39;ll push you in the hammock, bob.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll climb up a tree and pluck you a fresh coconut.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think so, bob.
 <br>
 Okay, it&#39;s your loss, but I&#39;m a big tipper.
 <br>
 Okay I got betsy&#39;s teddy bear.
 <br>
 And it wasn&#39;t easy dodging my brothers.
 <br>
 I got a dart in the calf.
 <br>
 oh.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s my little girl.
 <br>
 Huh ? Hey, baby.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Look, it&#39;s your teddy bear and your handsome daddy.
 <br>
 why won&#39;t she stop crying ? Maybe it is me.
 <br>
 What if she doesn&#39;t like me ? Kelso, don&#39;t take it personally.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t like you when I first met you.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s because you were peeing on my swing set.
 <br>
 Well, it was brand-new, and I was jealous.
 <br>
 one funnel cake, extra sugar.
 <br>
 Oh, steven, I knew you&#39;d come back, and to show you how thankful I am, I&#39;m gonna feed you a piece.
 <br>
 Oh, get a room.
 <br>
 Did you see red ? He didn&#39;t come back yet ? That&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 He was in front of me in the funnel cake line.
 <br>
 What the okay, gals, say, &#34;funnel cake.
 <br>
 &#34; funnel cake.
 <br>
 oh, my god ! There goes the fun.
 <br>
 Well, I hope you&#39;re happy, red forman, because we are leaving.
 <br>
 You two ! get your a-s-ses back to the car.
 <br>
 You two, get your b-double o-bs off my husband.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe that lookin&#39; in this mirror isn&#39;t puttin&#39; her in a great mood.
 <br>
 It always works for me.
 <br>
 Man, am I glad I found you guys.
 <br>
 All these houses look alike.
 <br>
 Except for that red one on the corner where the clown lives.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a mcdonald&#39;S.
 <br>
 well, whatever his name is, he&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s with the baby, man ? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t get her to quit crying.
 <br>
 Here, let me try.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 yeah.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you do that ? Babies love me, man, &#39;cause I&#39;m fuzzy.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go give her a bottle.
 <br>
 That proves it.
 <br>
 My own baby hates me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 She only stopped crying when leo held her because he has the shakes.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s me.
 <br>
 She hardly knows me, and a girl needs her father, you know, for guidance.
 <br>
 What happens if she grows up and starts dating, like, fez ? Boy, if she looks anything like you, she&#39;ll be way outta my league.
 <br>
 Kelso, if you really feel like that, you should start getting to know her now.
 <br>
 Go hold her.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Leo ? Oh, my god.
 <br>
 They&#39;re gone.
 <br>
 Everybody everybody just stay calm ! The breast milk is safe.
 <br>
 Are they outside ? Not in the driveway, but eric went to check the park.
 <br>
 And they&#39;re not upstairs.
 <br>
 Although I did find kitty&#39;s special occasion panties hanging on the towel bar.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a lot more goin&#39; on up there than we think.
 <br>
 How could i let this happen ? I am the worst father ever.
 <br>
 betsy ? No, michael, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m callin&#39; to check in.
 <br>
 How&#39;s she doing ? How&#39;s she doing ? Fine.
 <br>
 God, quit smothering her.
 <br>
 Hey, put the phone to her ear, let me say hi.
 <br>
 it&#39;s brooke.
 <br>
 She wants to talk to the baby.
 <br>
 Gimme.
 <br>
 hey, mama, send more milk.
 <br>
 Was that fez ? Yeah.
 <br>
 We we&#39;re just messin&#39; around.
 <br>
 But, uh, betsy she&#39;s she&#39;s sleepin&#39;.
 <br>
 She&#39;S yeah.
 <br>
 She&#39;s she&#39;s sleepin&#39;like a little somethin&#39; that sleeps a lot.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, just give her a kiss for me, and I&#39;ll see you later.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You guys, what am I gonna do ? I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m really startin&#39;to freak out.
 <br>
 All right, kelso, just relax.
 <br>
 She&#39;s with leo.
 <br>
 He&#39;s great with kids.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure he&#39;s watchin&#39; her like a hawk.
 <br>
 Oh, little sweetie.
 <br>
 What are you doin&#39; in my house, hippie ? Are you sure this is your house ? Of course it&#39;s my house.
 <br>
 I believe ya.
 <br>
 The guy screaming usually owns the house.
 <br>
 all right, when kitty shows up, she&#39;s gonna be pretty mad.
 <br>
 So I think we should just leave her here.
 <br>
 She can&#39;t getany madder.
 <br>
 I think you should definitely leave her here.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 they tried to leave you! I tried to stop &#39;em.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m perfectly fine.
 <br>
 I just need to speak to redin the car for a minute.
 <br>
 How could you, red forman ? Steven stayed with jackie, but you went off and gave my funnel cake to those whores.
 <br>
 I was just trying to have a little fun.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah ? Well, you can take your funand shove it up your michael, I just want to talk to my daughter.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, brooke.
 <br>
 She&#39;s still asleep.
 <br>
 Kelso, tell her the truth, or I&#39;m gonna touch you with mrs.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s special occasion panties.
 <br>
 Oh, those are in my backpack.
 <br>
 Okay brooke, uh about betsy.
 <br>
 There&#39;s something I have to tell you.
 <br>
 Anyone lose a baby ? I found her ! You found her ? No, no, I said, &#34;I love her.
 <br>
 &#34; That is not what you said.
 <br>
 You know what ? You never listen to me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hanging up.
 <br>
 Kelso, you did say you found her.
 <br>
 You know, you women all stick together.
 <br>
 think she wants her daddy.
 <br>
 it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Daddy&#39;s here.
 <br>
 do you hear that ? She stopped crying.
 <br>
 I think she knows it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 And I think she likes me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s so beautiful.
 <br>
 I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t do this.
 <br>
 Listen, kitty, I&#39;m sorry about today.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just they pay those ladies to flirt with guys like me.
 <br>
 They&#39;re almost hookers.
 <br>
 I shoulda stayed in the den.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 Those girls didn&#39;t bother me.
 <br>
 I can outlast those tramps any day of the week.
 <br>
 It was just seeing steven and jackie together.
 <br>
 Oh, you can&#39;t compare our mature relationship to what those kids have.
 <br>
 Ah, we&#39;re past all those highs and lows.
 <br>
 We&#39;re like A like a sailboat in a dead calm.
 <br>
 Look, kitty the important thing is every morning, I get to wake up next to my favorite girl in the whole world.
 <br>
 Reginald Albert forman.
 <br>
 whoa.
 <br>
 Okay, how about that ? On or off ? Yeah, that&#39;s a showstopper.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s too bad &#39;cause it really turns me on.
 <br>
 No, get god, get off of me.
 <br>
 Who loves you ? Your daddy does, that&#39;s who.
 <br>
 Well, I can&#39;t remember the last time you made that much of a fuss over me.
 <br>
 Ohh.
 <br>
 There&#39;s my baby girl.
 <br>
 Mommy missed you.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t want to let her go.
 <br>
 She&#39;s so beautiful and warm.
 <br>
 Well, apparently I&#39;m ugly and cold.
 <br>
 - Oh, here.
 <br>
 Look at her smiling.
 <br>
 - There we go.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m so happy she loves her daddy.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Yes, It is.
 <br>
 Hey, listen, uh I know I haven&#39;t been around much, but, uh that&#39;s gonna change &#39;cause she&#39;s my girl, and I wanna know her.
 <br>
 That would be awesome.
 <br>
 - Um - I got it.
 <br>
 Grab her stuff, and I&#39;ll go put her in the car.
 <br>
 Yeah, here.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 You need help, man.
 <br>
 Yes, I do.
 <br>
 I hate myself.
 <br>
 But the money&#39;s just so good.
 <br>
 A little faster so it stirs my drink.
 <br>
