 Oeh! Now I&#39;ve got Park Place and Boardwalk.
 <br>
 T his game is just like life! I am the richest of all.
 <br>
 Jackie I&#39;ve got ninehundred and seventy dollars here, it&#39;s all yours if you just GO AWAY! Relax Forman.
 <br>
 It&#39;s better then having Laurie down here.
 <br>
 She&#39;s like a big cancerous tumor.
 <br>
 And Jackie, she&#39;s like a tiny benign cyst.
 <br>
 Thank you Hyde! Here, buy yourself a hotel.
 <br>
 Why are you giving him money, I&#39;m the one in jail, does Hyde punch me in the arm.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t we start over? Because Aiiiii.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t try tipping over the board again either! Next time we go hiking make sure you bring a blanket.
 <br>
 I think I have a twig in my shorts.
 <br>
 What a coincidence, so does Kelso! BURN! Okay, okay, nice burn.
 <br>
 Hi Jackie.
 <br>
 Oh look it is Michael and his community chest.
 <br>
 Nice! So Michael, when you come over for dinner tonight, don&#39;t wear that stupid unicorn tie.
 <br>
 OH! Oh I&#39;m sorry Jackie, was that a gift? Oh yeah?! Well, were those shoes a gift? Because they&#39;re ugly! What are you even doing here anyways? Shouldn&#39;t you be off playing with ribbons and ponies? Well shouldn&#39;t you be off being a bitch? Oeh I made the little girl say a bad word! See you tonight Woops Laurie makes me SO mad! I just wanna rip out her hair, show it to her and hope it doesn&#39;t grow back.
 <br>
 I hate her.
 <br>
 Jackie, that&#39;s what she wants.
 <br>
 She feeds on your anger man, it only makes her stronger.
 <br>
 Well then what am I supposed to do? If you really want to get under her skin, you have to be Zen.
 <br>
 Zen? Okay, you can&#39;t just make up words Hyde.
 <br>
 No, man, Zen.
 <br>
 At peace, aloof Zen Okay then, Hyde, will you teach me how to be Zen? You can&#39;t just teach someone to be Zen Jackie, you can only learn to be Zen.
 <br>
 Okay, I don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s your first lesson.
 <br>
 Huh?! Jackie, if you wanna be my student you need to follow my instructions.
 <br>
 Without question.
 <br>
 Okay okay, see, I can do that.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 First thing, finish polishing my boots.
 <br>
 - Okay Hyde, how is THAT gonna help - WHAT? Okay! You make a fine student! Shine Grasshopper! Shine! Kelso, man you&#39;re not seriously coming to dinner tonight are you?! Why shouldn&#39;t I? You know, Jackie broke up with me and I needed a girlfriend and Laurie&#39;s it.
 <br>
 And plus I need to eat, soI&#39;m coming to dinner! Yeah Kelso, you&#39;re lame.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re sad.
 <br>
 But if you go to dinner with Red, you&#39;re gonna get your just deserts.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t really care what they serve I just wanna be there for Laurie you know.
 <br>
 Hope it&#39;s pie! Oh Kelso.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be SO bad! Can I come to dinner tonight? No.
 <br>
 Look, Red loves Laurie right, and Laurie likes me.
 <br>
 Therefore, Red has to like me.
 <br>
 I mean, what father wouldn&#39;t like the guy who is nailing his daughter? Oh Laurie you can&#39;t bring Michael to dinner! Are you out of your mind? Mom! I&#39;m an adult, and this is my choice.
 <br>
 No, if you were really an adult, you&#39;d try to meet someone with a future, instead of Michael, who, bless his heart, is probably gonna end up ripping tickets at the Tilt-A-World.
 <br>
 Well he could invent something! Yeah, I guess I&#39;m lazy.
 <br>
 Uhuh.
 <br>
 And Laurie, have you given any thought to what you&#39;re gonna say to your father when he finds out? HE&#39;S MY BOYFRIEND DADDY AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND YOU CAN&#39;T STOP US FROM BEING TOGETHER! What do you think? .
 <br>
 Laurie I absolutely forbid you to bring that boy to dinner! OH! Sometimes I hate you! Well, that is just too bad because I love you! Because I have to Whatéver No, more aloofness! Whatever I&#39;m not believing you.
 <br>
 Hyde, when are we going to move on? I have been saying &#39;whatever&#39; for half an hour! You can say very much by saying very little, small Grasshopper.
 <br>
 Pretend you&#39;re Laurie and insult me.
 <br>
 Okay Hey Hyde! Youre stupid! Whatever - Wow that was great! - Yeah! Now, another part of this is ambiguity.
 <br>
 Say it with me.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 BOTH: Ambiguity! Very good.
 <br>
 See, you dont want people to know exactly what you mean.
 <br>
 Here, ask me if I want to go to a movie tonight.
 <br>
 Hey Hyde, would you like to go to a movie tonight? Thats cool.
 <br>
 See, you dont know if I mean Thats cool - Ill go or Thats cool  no thanks.
 <br>
 - And thats cool? - Whatever Oh my God! I am so sorry I got impatient! Thats cool.
 <br>
 Hey guys.
 <br>
 So Jackie, Eric wont invite me to dinner tonight.
 <br>
 So do you wanna like go to the mall or something? Thats cool.
 <br>
 Wait, what do you mean? Oh my God it worked! I mean whatever Hi guys, sorry Im late What? You guys started eating without me?! That is SO rude! I&#39;m just kidding! Hahaha! Ahahahahahaa! Well Eric, you must have forgotten to mention that you invited Michael to dinner tonight? Oh right.
 <br>
 Uhhh yeah I guess I did! Oh and there are my chocolates, the chocolates that I asked you to bringover to me.
 <br>
 Oeh Fanny Farmer! No no, those are for Laurie! Kelso, what the hell are you doing here?! DAD! Err.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 nougat? Don&#39;t worry Red, I got something for you too!  Huhh! FIVE beers? Uh yeah, they were all out of sixpacksWeird huh.
 <br>
 Let me help you out with that there Red! Are you taking a beer?! HEY FOCUS MAN! He&#39;s dating your daughter! Laurie, what&#39;s going on? HE&#39;S MY BOYFRIEND DADDY! And he loves meandhe&#39;s good to me and we&#39;re happy together Kelso, you have five seconds to get as far away from me as possible.
 <br>
 But Red, what about our unspoken bond? ONE! TWO! I&#39;ll call you Beer Red? And the rest of dinnerwas eaten in complete silence.
 <br>
 The only sound was the dull throbbing of that vein in Red&#39;s giant shiny head.
 <br>
 Boy, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not Kelso.
 <br>
 Sure he&#39;s had sex a lot and I&#39;m still a virgin but OH I wish I was Kelso.
 <br>
 No you don&#39;t Fez.
 <br>
 Being Kelso is likeknowing the truth behind all the deceptions of society but not being able to convince any of your fellow suburban clones that anything&#39;s wrong man! No wait, that&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Man, I just totally forgot why I was laughing! Isn&#39;t that funny?! Okayno more for the cheerleader okay? Jackie you seem different.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s your hair, your outfitor your red puffy eyes.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 She&#39;s Zen man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve taken her under my wing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m running a dojo of coolness.
 <br>
 Jackie, demonstrate.
 <br>
 Oogly-googly.
 <br>
 Oogly.
 <br>
 Yeah, It&#39;s her first day Kitty I don&#39;t want our daughter dating that kettle-head! Well maybe it&#39;s just a phase.
 <br>
 Nohe&#39;s been a kettle-head since No no, I meant Laurie.
 <br>
 This is how it starts you know.
 <br>
 First they&#39;re dating and having fun and then the next thing you know they&#39;re prying the money to pay for a wedding from my cold dead hands.
 <br>
 Oh honey, they&#39;re not gonna get married! He&#39;ll leave her when she gets pregnant.
 <br>
 Ahahahahaha! Oh.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I see Mr.
 <br>
 Smiley isn&#39;t in town today I expected more from her.
 <br>
 What the hell is she doing with some highschool kid? She went to college! Well she did flunk out.
 <br>
 Oh Kitty.
 <br>
 I can see how their future is gonna turn out and it&#39;s not good ROBOT-FEZ (with robotvoice): More mashed potatoes Red? Why thank you, ServaTron 2000 Well that&#39;s cold! Damn foreign robots.
 <br>
 Oh it&#39;s so nice to have dinner with the family like this.
 <br>
 Yeah it&#39;s a good thing we found a babysitting droid for the quintuplets.
 <br>
 So Michael, how is the jobhunt going? Great! You know, they had a real short line at the unemployment office so I got home in time to catch the end of the Spaceprice is Right.
 <br>
 You know, times are tough for me and Kelso right now.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll help us won&#39;t you Daddy? I&#39;ll always be there for you honey.
 <br>
 I think she means financially Red.
 <br>
 I know what she means.
 <br>
 Kettle-head.
 <br>
 You&#39;re giving us more money, right dude? Yes dammit.
 <br>
 Allright allright.
 <br>
 Hey Laurie, I think it&#39;s time for our &#39;nap&#39; Allright! That&#39;s it! I&#39;ve got to go to Saturn on business for a week.
 <br>
 Now when I get back, you better have a job or it&#39;s off to the asteroidmines for you! ROBOT : Don&#39;t forget your briefcase Red Thank you ServaTron 2000.
 <br>
 Now, roll back the roof, cause I gotta go.
 <br>
 Jetpack blast off! Red! Red! That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just gonna tell her that she can&#39;t see him anymore.
 <br>
 No no, you can&#39;t do that Red.
 <br>
 In fact the more we fight it the more she&#39;s gonna want to be with kettle-head.
 <br>
 Ah at this rate I&#39;m gonna have a heart-attack before I even get my jetpack.
 <br>
 You know, I missed you guys.
 <br>
 Yeah this place just isn&#39;t the same when I&#39;m not around.
 <br>
 Oh hey.
 <br>
 You guys wanna hear a really funny story? I was just upstairs, and Red was yelling at me about you.
 <br>
 And uh then I said: what are you doing yelling at me, Kelso is right downstairs.
 <br>
 In fact.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get him for ya I said! Say that is a funny story! I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll talk to Red.
 <br>
 He was really mean to me, and here I&#39;m brought him a fivepack.
 <br>
 So I hope he is ready to apologize.
 <br>
 Oooohhh yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 If there&#39;s one thing Red&#39;s about, it&#39;s forgiveness No he&#39;s not.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the opposite of that! Oh wait.
 <br>
 I get you! Funny! Wait uhh Red, can&#39;t we leave that open? Have a seat Kelso.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about your &#34;relationship&#34; with my only daughter.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a gem.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Kitty says that if the two of you want to see eachother there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.
 <br>
 But she&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Cause I could kill ya.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a joke Kelso.
 <br>
 You should laugh when I make a joke.
 <br>
 Huhuhhhey good one Red See you&#39;re making me think that I should take a personal interest in you.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t want that.
 <br>
 Take Eric for example.
 <br>
 I have a personal interest in him.
 <br>
 Oh God.
 <br>
 There you go.
 <br>
 What you wanna do here, is fly in under my radar.
 <br>
 So that if I never see you and Laurie together, or hear your name mentioned in the same breath I might just forget that you even exist.
 <br>
 Got it? Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay so you mean if me and Laurie UH now, see, you just mentioned my daughters name.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Okay uhh, if Kelso and your daughter No no no no, see that&#39;s not gonna work either.
 <br>
 Well this is hard Red! Well you gonna be here till you get it right Kelso! Well okay Red, but eventually my parents are gonna come looking for me.
 <br>
 Yeah, but they&#39;re not gonna find ya! Well that&#39;s another joke! Come on, laugh Kelso! Oh you again.
 <br>
 What happened, did they let out kindergarden early today? Whatever.
 <br>
 Jackie don&#39;t you have a lame comeback, saved for just this very occasion? That&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 Ohhh so now you&#39;re little miss Cool huh.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Well, if you&#39;re really as cool as you think you are, you would have been able to hold on to your one true love.
 <br>
 But you couldn&#39;t, could you? Loser! Oh well.
 <br>
 Catfight!! You guys stop it!! OWWW! You bit me! Jackie hit her in the eye!! Oh I know! We can throw water on them and then we can see through their shirts! BITCH!! You kicked her ass man! Yeah yeah, whatever Oh my God, I&#39;m so turned on! I can&#39;t believe Laurie bit me.
 <br>
 I hope she didn&#39;t give me like slut rabies.
 <br>
 Jackie, you&#39;re my hero! You hit her in the eye! Yeah, but I guess it wasn&#39;t very Zen of me, was it Hyde? Well, where Zen ends ass-kicking begins.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s your final lesson, Grasshopper.
 <br>
 Hey man, let&#39;s do that thing where we all sit in a circle again The fact, that you actually went into garage with Red, that&#39;s so brave.
 <br>
 Yeah,I guess we both have to fight for our love baby.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m coming to the living room now - Dough Well, hi there kitten.
 <br>
 Hi daddy.
