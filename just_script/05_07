<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 What are those? Oh, Donna.
 <br>
 Did you buy Playboy for me? No, they&#39;re college brochures.
 <br>
 Donna, these people are fully dressed.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just not gonna work for me.
 <br>
 My guidance counselor gave them to me but I already told him I&#39;m going wherever you go.
 <br>
 How did I ever get a girl as great as you? - You know you can do better than me, right? - ( Laughs ) - But you&#39;re right next door.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so easy.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 Oh, you two make me sick.
 <br>
 Looks like my mom, but speaks like my dad.
 <br>
 I-I- I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean that.
 <br>
 That wasn&#39;t me talking.
 <br>
 That was- That was-That was the menopause.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t have to apologize.
 <br>
 We totally get what you&#39;re going through.
 <br>
 Well, thank the Lord! Fertile Myrtle totally gets it! - I miss the basement.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Kitty, I know these past few weeks have been hard on you- hard on all of us, really.
 <br>
 But especially hard on you.
 <br>
 I mean, since you found out you were- Just say it, Red.
 <br>
 Barren.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s no need for both of us to say it.
 <br>
 So I got somethin&#39; to cheer my girl up.
 <br>
 Oh, good, &#39;cause I finished off the last bottle this morning.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 I got you a puppy.
 <br>
 He needs someone to take care of him.
 <br>
 - His mother got run over by a car.
 <br>
 - Did you run over a dog, Red? No! I just hate to see you sad, and I thought- Oh, forget it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take him back and go to the liquor store.
 <br>
 Well, now wait.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 He&#39;s kind of cute.
 <br>
 Can I hold him? Oh-ho-ho! What a little lover boy! Ooh! - See? He likes you.
 <br>
 - ( Barks ) Ah, how about that? He&#39;s got menopause too.
 <br>
 ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) I&#39;ll see you later.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go get out of this thing.
 <br>
 - Oh, boo! - Selfish! Man, what is with you guys and this uniform? It makes us want to corrupt you.
 <br>
 Man, Donna is so awesome.
 <br>
 She can afford to go to any school she wants but she wants to go where I go just so we can be together.
 <br>
 Yeah, she is awesome.
 <br>
 Why is she with you again? &#39;Cause a good girlfriend accepts her guy no matter what.
 <br>
 Jackie was always trying to change me.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Grow up, Michael.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Act your age, Michael.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Stop shooting grandmother with a water pistol, Michael.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; She&#39;s 92, Michael.
 <br>
 She had jam on her face! Well, all I know is things with me and Donna are going really, really well.
 <br>
 This is just about the point where I screw things up.
 <br>
 - So don&#39;t screw it up.
 <br>
 - Fez.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Oh, Fez.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) If history has taught us anything, it&#39;s that screwing up is my nature.
 <br>
 But you know what I can do is bank a little goodwill- do something nice.
 <br>
 - ( Snaps Fingers ) - Buy her a present.
 <br>
 Yep, she deserves it too.
 <br>
 Do you know how many times I tried to grab her boob on the way to California? And it would&#39;ve been easier for her if she would&#39;ve let me! &#39;Cause you know me.
 <br>
 I won&#39;t stop.
 <br>
 I gotta get Donna something really special something that reminds her that even though I&#39;m an idiot I&#39;m an idiot who loves her.
 <br>
 I got it! A scented candle! Chicks can&#39;t keep their shirt on around a scented candle.
 <br>
 Please, the battlefield of love is littered with guys who give candles.
 <br>
 It&#39;s expensive jewelry or nothing.
 <br>
 Look, if you can&#39;t put a price tag on love then how do you know how much it&#39;s worth? Jackie, what kind of crap is that? - You haven&#39;t learned a thing from me.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 Steven.
 <br>
 Well, what do you mean? I mean, romance was created by corporations to prey on losers who think buying nice things will make somebody love them.
 <br>
 If you ever read anything besides what- ( Scoffs ) Donny Osmond puts on his waffles, you might learn something.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) I put whipped cream on my waffles too.
 <br>
 I eat like the stars! - ( Remote Clicks ) - Hey, when did you get the cute little wiener dog? No, no, no, no, no! Not in my chair! Red Forman! Schotzie is a helpless, little animal with four breakable legs.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t throw him around the room like you would Eric! Red, you don&#39;t seem like the type of guy who&#39;d get a dog being that you&#39;re unfriendly.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 I just wanted to do something to cheer Kitty up.
 <br>
 Well, if you really wanted to cheer her up, you should&#39;ve bought her a banjo.
 <br>
 A banjo, Bob? You can&#39;t hold a banjo and not smile.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t hold a potato chip and not smile.
 <br>
 Yes? Um, I want to buy a present for my girlfriend you know, that lets her know how I feel about her.
 <br>
 Oh, no problem.
 <br>
 Oh, oh.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Would the, uh, lady like a necklace? Huh? ( Muttering ) - Well, it&#39;s- it&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s a little- little creepy.
 <br>
 - Mmm.
 <br>
 Um, it doesn&#39;t really say what I want to say though.
 <br>
 Oh, okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh.
 <br>
 - How about a promise ring? - Oh, don&#39;t even - get me started on promise rings.
 <br>
 - Really? Like, once I gave her one, and she didn&#39;t even want it.
 <br>
 - But then she gave me- - How about that.
 <br>
 Look how that shines.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s nice, huh? Uh.
 <br>
 Well, your finger hair - curling over the ring is kind of ruining it for me.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Does, uh, wearing the merchandise usually work for you? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m new here.
 <br>
 I used to work at the lingerie store.
 <br>
 - They fired me.
 <br>
 - Ah, yes.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 I think I know what you&#39;re looking for.
 <br>
 Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 How about a diamond ring? Oh, isn&#39;t that gorgeous? Look at that.
 <br>
 - Whoa.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s an engagement ring.
 <br>
 - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in high school, man.
 <br>
 That says, uh, too much.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t you tell me what it is you wanna say? That I love her and we should be together forever.
 <br>
 An engagement ring says that verbatim.
 <br>
 Well, too bad, &#39;cause I ain&#39;t buyin&#39; one.
 <br>
 Well, I refuse to put on any more jewelry! Well, thank God for that! ( Clears Throat ) - Would you like to look around a little more? - Sure.
 <br>
 And sorry about what I said.
 <br>
 - You look-You look really nice.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 ( Stereo: Rock ) Donna.
 <br>
 You, me, tonight at the water tower.
 <br>
 Make yourself foxy, &#39;cause you&#39;re getting something pretty special.
 <br>
 Really.
 <br>
 A present? I will get foxy.
 <br>
 Oh, and Donna? Donna, don&#39;t forget to wear flats so that Eric can feel like the boy.
 <br>
 So, Forman, you finally broke down, huh? - What&#39;d you get her? Earrings? A little bracelet? - No.
 <br>
 I got her way more than a piece of jewelry.
 <br>
 I got her a gift that really says something- a diamond engagement ring.
 <br>
 As a joke? No.
 <br>
 You guys, I&#39;m gonna ask Donna to marry me.
 <br>
 As a joke? The stupid helmet? Why do I have to wear the stupid helmet? Because you&#39;re stupid! You can&#39;t ask Donna to marry you, man! Why not? I mean, come on.
 <br>
 We already know that we&#39;re gonna be together forever.
 <br>
 No, you think that you&#39;re gonna be together forever.
 <br>
 Remember how you were worried about screwing things up? This your Bay of Pigs, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, even in my country we weren&#39;t stupid enough to get married in high school.
 <br>
 And we eat bugs! Forman, what the hell are you thinking? You don&#39;t understand, okay? I love her.
 <br>
 I was down at the store and I realized- What am I waiting for? We&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t get engaged when you&#39;re happy! What&#39;s the point? You do it when your back&#39;s against the wall and there&#39;s no way out like if the girl&#39;s pregnant.
 <br>
 It is settled, then.
 <br>
 Eric will get Donna pregnant.
 <br>
 I will oversee the proceedings for verification purposes.
 <br>
 Ah, but he&#39;s so stupid, how do we know he can do it? -Jackie, help me out here.
 <br>
 - Well, I think it&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 Well, then you&#39;re crazy too.
 <br>
 Look, Steven.
 <br>
 I am my own woman, okay? I&#39;m allowed to have opinions about jewelry, you present hater! Listen, you guys.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve thought about this a lot, okay? Donna&#39;s willing to commit four years of college to me.
 <br>
 I wanna commit too.
 <br>
 Forman, I say this to you as a friend that likes to see you get hurt.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t take that ring back right now you are going to end up in a world of misery and pain.
 <br>
 Hey, I love Donna, okay? So, did it ever occur to any of you that I&#39;m ready for a world of misery and pain? Think about that! Who wants the last piece of salami? I&#39;ll take it.
 <br>
 Who wants the salami? - I said, I do.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) There you go, Schotzie! I said, I wanted that.
 <br>
 But he was begging, Red.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t turn down beggars.
 <br>
 Do we, Schotzie? No, we don&#39;t! Okay, you guys know more about relationships than my moron friends - so I have a question about me and Donna.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No more about you and Donna.
 <br>
 You need to be thinking about your future- college, getting out of my house.
 <br>
 But Donna is my future.
 <br>
 Honey, we know you love Donna but you two are so on again and off again.
 <br>
 You&#39;re probably gonna be off again sometime soon.
 <br>
 Won&#39;t they, Schotzie? Yes, they will! How about a career? Have you even given thought to what you&#39;re gonna do with your life? - Yes, Donna and I- - I think he should be a pharmacist.
 <br>
 Now there&#39;s an idea.
 <br>
 You can count.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no heavy lifting.
 <br>
 You oughta see him try to wrestle with that big mop down at the store.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) - I don&#39;t see what any of this has to do with me and Donna.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, but you would be such a good pharmacist.
 <br>
 Your slender fingers are perfect for picking up tiny pills.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t they, Schotzie? Yes, they are! ( Laughs ) Did you see that? He just nodded.
 <br>
 Man, everyone&#39;s down on me and Donna getting engaged-you guys, my parents.
 <br>
 Even the Magic 8-Ball said, &#39;&#39;Outlook not so good.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I just- Lo- I really think Donna would love an engagement ring.
 <br>
 Oh, she&#39;ll love the ring.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the thought behind it that&#39;ll send her running for the hills.
 <br>
 Or, maybe she&#39;ll see how smart it is to get married when you&#39;re still in high school and have no money or future.
 <br>
 I know I ran when Jackie wanted to marry me.
 <br>
 &#39;Cept I ran for California instead of the hills.
 <br>
 I mean, the beach kicks the hills&#39;s ass! I mean, there&#39;s way more bikinis, and they usually have a snack bar! What if you guys are right? What if she thinks I&#39;m moving too fast? Man, giving her this ring is a huge gamble.
 <br>
 Am I man enough to make that bet? No, no.
 <br>
 The answer is no.
 <br>
 You see, Forman? You tried to do a nice, thoughtful thing, and you screwed yourself.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all about expectations, man.
 <br>
 Like, I&#39;ve taughtJackie to think I&#39;m rude and inconsiderate.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t disappoint her, because I&#39;m always disappointing her! And if I don&#39;t give Donna the ring, what are we gonna do at the water tower? Oh, God! I do deserve this! Does anyone else think that Schotzie looks like Fez? That dog is flyin&#39;! Well, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into Schotzie.
 <br>
 He&#39;s so hungry, he went through three cans of food.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you, Schotzie? Yes, I did! ( Giggling ) Hey, Bob, hand me that remote there, will ya? No, thanks, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;d have to buckle my belt.
 <br>
 Well, buckle your belt anyway.
 <br>
 No one wants to see that.
 <br>
 Oh, not again! There we go.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) What the hell? Oh, crap! That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 That damn dog&#39;s gotta go! I think he just went, Red.
 <br>
 ( Cackling ) - Are you laughin&#39;, Bob? - Your bottom&#39;s all wet.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just plain funny in my book.
 <br>
 Well, he can&#39;t stay.
 <br>
 He&#39;s makin&#39; everyone miserable.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Kitty&#39;s seemed pretty darn happy the past couple of days.
 <br>
 - Yeah, well- - Look, Red.
 <br>
 You did a nice thing.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t spoil it by, you know, being yourself.
 <br>
 I guess if the incontinent little bastard makes Kitty happy I&#39;ll put up with it.
 <br>
 What the hell? I&#39;ve never been that happy anyway.
 <br>
 At least, not since I&#39;ve known you.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Weird coincidence, huh? Okay.
 <br>
 Look, you.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking about all your conspiracy mumbo jumbo about presents and diamonds and buying me stuff.
 <br>
 And I realized that all your paranoid, delusional crap about romance is just a cover-up for you being cheap! Okay, first of all, it&#39;s not paranoid, delusional crap.
 <br>
 Advertisers spend billions to make you think I&#39;m a jerk if I don&#39;t buy you jewelry.
 <br>
 And second of all, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I am cheap.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;d better quit it.
 <br>
 Because I like to get stuff especially shiny stuff.
 <br>
 Would you settle for a cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil? Well, for you I will.
 <br>
 But just know that I&#39;m really lowering my standards.
 <br>
 That makes two of us.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 So? Huh? This is romantic, huh? It&#39;s a little more romantic in the summer or any time not below freezing.
 <br>
 - So what am I getting? - What are you getting? What are you getting? This is what you&#39;re gettin&#39;.
 <br>
 - A candy bar? - Well, half a candy bar.
 <br>
 I figured, uh, you know, we could share it under the stars.
 <br>
 What a delightful moonlit snack.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re being weird, and it&#39;s freezing out here.
 <br>
 Aw, come on.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not that cold.
 <br>
 - Uhh.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) - Eric, why are we up here? - Okay, I&#39;m sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 I had something that I was gonna give you, but I realized it was stupid.
 <br>
 Or everyone said it was stupid, so I just decided against it.
 <br>
 - Well, what was it? - It was nothing.
 <br>
 Well, it was something.
 <br>
 I mean, I can see that it was something.
 <br>
 -Just tell me.
 <br>
 - Okay, fine.
 <br>
 I was gonna give you this.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Is that a- - Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s stupid, right? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) And no.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 What would you have done with it? Well, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I guess I would have told you how beautiful you are and that you mean everything to me.
 <br>
 And then I would&#39;ve gone down on one knee you know, like this.
 <br>
 And I would&#39;ve taken your hand and taken the ring- Go ahead.
 <br>
 and I would have put the ring on your finger like this.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 So, uh- So, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 Uh, why don&#39;t I just hold on to that until you know, until the real moment comes.
 <br>
 Oh, sure.
 <br>
 Or I could hold on to it.
 <br>
 - You could? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Eric, I love you, and I wanna be with you forever.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I told everyone and they made me wear the stupid helmet.
 <br>
 So, um - did we just get- - I think we did.
 <br>
 Donna, I love you.
 <br>
 - We are so stupid! - I know, right? Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Here comes your dad.
 <br>
 Put the ring in your pocket.
 <br>
 - Why? He&#39;ll be happy for us! - Oh, yeah? Hey, Mr.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, what would you do if I, say -made a long-term commitment to your daughter? -Oh, I&#39;d kill ya.
 <br>
 You know what? A secret engagement is even more romantic.
 <br>
 And more stupid.
 <br>
