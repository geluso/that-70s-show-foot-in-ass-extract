<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, whatcha doin&#39;? Just countin&#39; my secret stash.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m gettin&#39; something special for Donna.
 <br>
 - Something special, huh? Oh, is it firecrackers? No.
 <br>
 No, no, &#39;cause if it&#39;s somethin&#39; that blows up, I&#39;ll go halfsies.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a promise ring.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause, you know, Donna and I have been fighting a lot lately.
 <br>
 Forman, you get mushy with Donna she&#39;s gonna see the secret girl inside the man.
 <br>
 Now, trust me, you don&#39;t want to let Erica out.
 <br>
 Erica.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good burn.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t do that with Michael.
 <br>
 I&#39;m lucky.
 <br>
 Oh, really, Michelle? Oh, I forgot about Michelle.
 <br>
 Look, Hyde obviously doesn&#39;t understand mature relationships but I do.
 <br>
 And a promise ring is not only a gift from the heart but it also means more sex and less mouthing off.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gettin&#39; one for Jackie too! Great.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 See you later, Hyde-a alicia.
 <br>
 What&#39;s a good girlie name for Hyde? Uh, Hyde drangea? It&#39;s Heidi, you morons! Heidi! Okay, is it me, or is this not a ring store? Will you trust me? I know a guy who knows a guy.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll be here any minute.
 <br>
 Hey, dudes.
 <br>
 Leo&#39;s the guy? Kelso, I thought you knew a guy who knew a guy.
 <br>
 Yeah, I do.
 <br>
 But I know Leo.
 <br>
 Fine, so you&#39;re the guy! So, Leo, you sell promise rings? Promise rings, concert T&#39;s other stuff.
 <br>
 - Really? - That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, we&#39;ll take two rings and a misdemeanor&#39;s worth of the other stuff.
 <br>
 Ah, the ring of love.
 <br>
 Just holding it makes me feel mellow and content.
 <br>
 Actually, that might not be the ring.
 <br>
 Why is everybody but Fez in love? If I don&#39;t get some romance soon, I&#39;m going to give myself a blister.
 <br>
 Well, another blister.
 <br>
 Tell you what, Fez.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to take you cruising for chicks in the El Camino.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna let you buy the gas and buy my dinner.
 <br>
 And if we meet a chick I&#39;m gonna let you walk home.
 <br>
 Guys, what if Jackie doesn&#39;t want a ring from a guy like me? I mean, sure, I&#39;m good lookin&#39;, but I can&#39;t be trusted.
 <br>
 No, you guys are the perfect couple.
 <br>
 You do the bad stuff, and she tries to catch you.
 <br>
 She&#39;s Smokey to your Bandit.
 <br>
 God, it&#39;s like that movie applies to everything! I just I wish there was a way I could give Jackie a thing that wasn&#39;t actually the ring.
 <br>
 You know, like a a test gift just to see what she would say.
 <br>
 And then if it went bad, I could just walk away.
 <br>
 Hey, am I talking in rhyme? I wish I could do that all the time.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh, man! That was fun, huh? It was a good movie.
 <br>
 It was one of those love movies like you like, huh? And who took ya? This guy.
 <br>
 - Yeah, it was great.
 <br>
 - You know what else this guy did for ya? Got you a present.
 <br>
 &#34;To Donna.
 <br>
 Love, This Guy.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! It&#39;s a promise ring.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s it&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad you like it.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause look - even though things have been a little weird lately - Oh! Look how cute on the car! Here, look what Eric got me! Oh, my! Red, go get the camera.
 <br>
 - Kitty - Mom, I Go! It&#39;s in the drawer near the cheese grater.
 <br>
 Mom No.
 <br>
 Hush.
 <br>
 Donna, now make the face you made when Eric gave you the ring.
 <br>
 Oh, now, see, I don&#39;t think you rolled your eyes! Kitty I cut myself on the cheese grater.
 <br>
 Oh, now you get back here and smile, damn it! Can you believe it? - Isn&#39;t it pretty? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I really need to introduce you to my good friend nail polish.
 <br>
 And a promise ring is sacred, Donna.
 <br>
 - Why aren&#39;t you wearing it on your left ring finger? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I like it on this finger.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the difference? Donna, if you don&#39;t wear your promise ring on your left ring finger it totally cancels out the promise that you will be together forever.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I promised? Hey, ladies.
 <br>
 Oh, nice ring, Donna.
 <br>
 Jackie, let me see yours.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t have one.
 <br>
 - Oh, no, of course not.
 <br>
 Because Kelso has not given you one yet.
 <br>
 I mean, ever.
 <br>
 I mean Look away.
 <br>
 Donna, did you hear that? Michael&#39;s giving me a promise ring.
 <br>
 - Yeah, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - I wonder how he&#39;s gonna give it to me.
 <br>
 I hope he hides it in food.
 <br>
 I told him if he ever gives me something nice he should put it in food.
 <br>
 It&#39;s classy.
 <br>
 All right, man, be cool.
 <br>
 These chicks are checking us out.
 <br>
 Cool, gotcha.
 <br>
 Hello, ladies! No, man, that&#39;s not how you do it.
 <br>
 You gotta be aloof.
 <br>
 Did you just call me a &#34;loof&#34;? Because if so, I&#39;ll have to kick you in your &#39;nads.
 <br>
 No, man.
 <br>
 Aloof.
 <br>
 Distant.
 <br>
 Zen.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s not what loof means in my language.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t care what you think it means, that&#39;s what it means here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the loof.
 <br>
 - Fez, it&#39;s not - I said loof! Hey, sweetie.
 <br>
 I got you something.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a gift.
 <br>
 A token of my love.
 <br>
 - Do you accept it? - A sundae? Oh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Mmm! Michael, this is good.
 <br>
 Uh You could, uh Uh, y-you could close your mouth if you if you wanted.
 <br>
 What the hell, Michael? This is ice cream.
 <br>
 Stupid ice cream? No, it&#39;s stupid ice cream of love.
 <br>
 Oh, there you are.
 <br>
 The movie&#39;s about to start.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 We&#39;re - Where&#39;s your ring? - Oh, I put it on a chain so I could wear it around my neck.
 <br>
 Burn! Oh, super burn.
 <br>
 The wedding&#39;s off! Kelso, shut up! Yeah, Michael, you don&#39;t know anything about anything.
 <br>
 I do too! Now I don&#39;t know which fight&#39;s the funniest.
 <br>
 Wait, fight? We&#39;re Okay, I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 Donna, why aren&#39;t you wearing the ring on your hand? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t think it was a big deal.
 <br>
 That is not true! I told you.
 <br>
 I told her it was a big deal.
 <br>
 Look, Eric, why don&#39;t we talk about this later? Well, I You know, there&#39;s not really anything to talk about.
 <br>
 Unless you don&#39;t wanna wear the ring.
 <br>
 Ouch! Sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s great.
 <br>
 The ring is great.
 <br>
 See? - It&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - So we&#39;re good? Yeah, fine.
 <br>
 Okay, good.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my God-given right as a mother! Oh, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, that is a wonderful picture.
 <br>
 You can really see how unhappy Donna is.
 <br>
 Okay, all I know is when Donna said she was fine, she didn&#39;t seem that fine.
 <br>
 Eric has never been good at knowing when fine isn&#39;t fine.
 <br>
 It runs in the family.
 <br>
 Oh, it does not.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 - Okay, good.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t look that unhappy.
 <br>
 She kinda looks like you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m unhappy, Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just so worried about Eric and Donna.
 <br>
 Ah, fine.
 <br>
 Welcome to Let&#39;s Make A Deal! All right, Donna, which is it going to be your future behind door number one, door number two or door number three? Oh, my God! I don&#39;t know! Um - Okay.
 <br>
 - Yeah? - Door number three.
 <br>
 - Door number three.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s take a look at what you didn&#39;t choose behind door number one! It&#39;s a leather jacket and a typewriter which you could have used when you became a globe-trotting rock-and-roll journalist.
 <br>
 Wow, that would&#39;ve been nice.
 <br>
 Yeah, too bad.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s take a look at what was behind door number two.
 <br>
 The U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 Constitution, which would come in handy when you became the first woman president! Oh, Monty, these prizes are bitchin&#39;! Yeah, truly bitchin&#39;.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s take a look at what you did choose behind door number three.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your boyfriend and a promise ring! I love you! Hyde, when I cruise a girl how long do I have to talk to her before she will French me? That depends on what kind of girl you&#39;re cruising for.
 <br>
 Which is why I&#39;m gonna aim low.
 <br>
 Real low.
 <br>
 Just this side of gross.
 <br>
 Where is Michael Kelso? I want my ring! He&#39;s in the toilet.
 <br>
 Jackie, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Kelso wants to give you the ring - but he&#39;s scared.
 <br>
 - Why is he scared? Because you&#39;re scary.
 <br>
 No, because Kelso is delicate, sensitive.
 <br>
 Girlish even.
 <br>
 You cannot push him into this.
 <br>
 You gotta be gentle.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll do it when he&#39;s ready.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s my ring, you idiot? Or yell at him.
 <br>
 It&#39;s more fun for us.
 <br>
 Look, you, I want my promise ring, and I want it now.
 <br>
 Give it.
 <br>
 Really? Okay, just wait.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I I just I wanna do this right.
 <br>
 Jackie from the first minute that I saw you I knew that I wanted to fool around with you.
 <br>
 And then, after we did that and I still wanted to talk to you? I knew that I never wanted to be without you.
 <br>
 So will you accept my ring? Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, Michael, I will.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s up? - So, how was cruising? - Unsettling.
 <br>
 When a girl is in a car, you can only see her from the neck up.
 <br>
 Talk about the tip of the iceberg! Oh.
 <br>
 - So where&#39;s Donna? - Ah, she said she had to study.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 So everything&#39;s cool? Okay Look I don&#39;t know what everyone thinks is going on but Donna and I are not only fine we&#39;re great.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s finally settled, so we&#39;re happier than ever.
 <br>
 Well, one of you is.
 <br>
 - What is that supposed to mean? - Look, Forman I get what you&#39;re trying to do.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;re trying to lock her up, seal the deal.
 <br>
 And all I&#39;m saying is Maybe Donna&#39;s not that kind of girl.
 <br>
 Okay, you don&#39;t know as much as you think, Hyde.
 <br>
 So you need to just shut up.
 <br>
 Now, that man is a loof.
 <br>
 Hey! What are you doing out here? Um I wanted to talk to you.
 <br>
 Look, this is gonna be hard.
 <br>
 Um Eric, I love you.
 <br>
 A lot.
 <br>
 But I have to give you your ring back.
 <br>
 What? Why? Okay How do you see the next 20 years? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I guess I always figured we&#39;d go to college together, then come home Yeah, but, Eric, you know that&#39;s not what I want.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;ve told you that.
 <br>
 And who knows? I might want to go to school back East.
 <br>
 Or maybe in Paris.
 <br>
 Okay, well, you know what, Donna, whatever.
 <br>
 Okay? The important thing is when you see yourself in Paris or wherever I&#39;m there, right? Right? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Not always.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anyone else but sometimes I&#39;m by myself.
 <br>
 I mean All I mean is, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Neither of us does.
 <br>
 And this ring is just a stupid high school promise.
 <br>
 If we&#39;re meant to be together, then we&#39;ll end up together.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 The way we end up together is by saying we&#39;ll be together and then, being together.
 <br>
 Eric, come on.
 <br>
 We&#39;re together now.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that enough? No! I mean I mean, damn, Donna.
 <br>
 If you can see a future for yourself without me and that doesn&#39;t, like, break your heart then we&#39;re not doing what I thought we were doing here.
 <br>
 And you know what? Maybe we shouldn&#39;t even be together at all! Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Are you breaking up with me? Well are you giving back that ring? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Then Yes.
 <br>
 - Leo, I I need to return this.
 <br>
 - Hey, man I only said it was gold, not real gold.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s Donna and I broke up.
 <br>
 What? What happened to the love, man? Well, I don&#39;t really feel like No! If you kids can&#39;t make it, who can? Tell me, who? Why, God, why?
 <br>
