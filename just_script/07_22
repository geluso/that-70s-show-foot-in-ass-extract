<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 hey ! Great news.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on my way to becoming a teacher.
 <br>
 I filled out all my college applications in red pen.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a little that&#39;s, like, a little teacher joke.
 <br>
 Well, now look at him out of bed and doing something productive before noon.
 <br>
 Honey, you&#39;re like a marine.
 <br>
 A marine ? The only time I ever saw him storm a beach was when he was running away from a jellyfish.
 <br>
 Hey, dad, all I need from you now is a financial statement so the school can see where I&#39;m getting the old moola.
 <br>
 Uh, well, um, bad news.
 <br>
 I, uh I spent your college money to keep the muffler shop going.
 <br>
 What ? This is really weird, because my parents, instead of paying for my college, bought me a muffler.
 <br>
 Dad, how am I supposed to pay for college ? Look, with this damn mild winter, nobody&#39;s muffler rusted.
 <br>
 I tried to rust them.
 <br>
 I went out at night and sprinkled salt all over the streets.
 <br>
 Not my good kosher salt.
 <br>
 Yes, kitty, I sprinkled the streets of point place with your half-pound bag of salt.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Mom, you knew about this ? And you just said, &#34;please, go ahead.
 <br>
 &#34;Take my son&#39;s college money and use it on a muffler shop&#34; ? No.
 <br>
 I think your father asked me if I thought you would amount to anything, and I said, &#34;I really, really hope so.
 <br>
 &#34; And then he said, &#34;I&#39;m spending eric&#39;s college money on my muffler shop.
 <br>
 &#34; And then I made the best blueberry cobbler I have ever made.
 <br>
 Man, that was good.
 <br>
 Best cobbler ever.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 I remember that cobbler.
 <br>
 I always wondered why, when I said it was so good, you said, &#34;at least I can give you this,&#34; and started to cry.
 <br>
 Well, look at the bright side.
 <br>
 There&#39;s always a place for you at a failing muffler shop.
 <br>
 So the upshot is, I have absolutely no money for college.
 <br>
 Eric, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 There are plenty of ways to get money for school.
 <br>
 Yeah, man.
 <br>
 You could always get a football scholarship.
 <br>
 Hey, look, he weighs about as much as a football, and people do like to kick him.
 <br>
 I know what you should do.
 <br>
 You should go to hollywood and become the next gene wilder.
 <br>
 That guy&#39;s a laugh riot.
 <br>
 Eric, you should go see mr.
 <br>
 Bray.
 <br>
 Finding money for college is what high school guidance counselors do.
 <br>
 Yeah, they also spend a lot of time staring at themselves in the mirror saying, &#34;I can&#39;t believe &#34;I&#39;m a high school guidance counselor.
 <br>
 &#34; I don&#39;t know about mr.
 <br>
 Bray.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think he really liked me.
 <br>
 One time I told him I was being bullied, and he just said, &#34;what&#39;d you expect ?&#34; All right, I&#39;ll go with you.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll help.
 <br>
 He totally loved me in almost entirely appropriate ways.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m breaking up with angie.
 <br>
 All we have anymore is hot sex.
 <br>
 Hot sex ? All I have is hot soup.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t make love to that.
 <br>
 Too damn hot.
 <br>
 So, kelso, you gonna break up with her your usual way send a note saying you got kidnapped by kung fu robots ? No, it won&#39;t work with her.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t even believe in kung fu robots.
 <br>
 Just gonna have to talk to her.
 <br>
 Whoa ! Kelso, you never break up with a girl to her face.
 <br>
 You usually have me tell her you&#39;re dead.
 <br>
 And then when she eventually sees you, you have me tell her you&#39;re a ghost.
 <br>
 Michael, why don&#39;t you do what you did with me ? Toilet paper my house ! I can&#39;t do that to angie.
 <br>
 I respect her too much &#39;cause she agreed to have sex with me so fast.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t care how you do it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just happy you won&#39;t be violating my sister anymore.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know you hated it, hyde.
 <br>
 I would have broken up with her sooner if I didn&#39;t find it so hilarious.
 <br>
 you be nice, or I will marry her.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 22 &#34;2000 Light Years From Home&#34; I&#39;m so glad you came by, daddy.
 <br>
 Well, I missed you guys.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not just your rich boss.
 <br>
 I&#39;m also your rich dad.
 <br>
 In fact, everyone related to me, grab some cash from the register.
 <br>
 Uh, I&#39;ve already been in there once today.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re the boss.
 <br>
 okay.
 <br>
 I can do this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just gonna tell angie that things are fizzling between us, and we should end it.
 <br>
 - Hey, how&#39;s it going, sweets ? - Not bad, toots.
 <br>
 Oh, him.
 <br>
 Go, go, go.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, um, we need to talk about something.
 <br>
 This might be kind of hard to take.
 <br>
 Fez still wets the bed.
 <br>
 - What ? - Eww ! At least we&#39;re still together.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll see you later.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to wet your bed.
 <br>
 Hey, angie, can you recommend a record ? Something dean martiny, but not dean martin, because I don&#39;t like that he didn&#39;t wave to me in atlantic city.
 <br>
 Well,  I don&#39;t know much about dean martin, but I do know that the top-selling record this week is blondie.
 <br>
 A broad, huh ? Is she jazzy ? Well, I know she&#39;s blonde.
 <br>
 Here you go, bob.
 <br>
 Try this joey bishop.
 <br>
 He swings like dean, but he&#39;ll wave at anybody.
 <br>
 Good  job knowing the number one album, honey.
 <br>
 I love watching you in action, because the more you work, the less I have to.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m just trying to get ready for the day you kick the bucket, and I get everything.
 <br>
 Just like her mother.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I have to tell my high school guidance counselor that I spent an entire year doing nothing.
 <br>
 He&#39;s gonna think I&#39;m such a loser.
 <br>
 Oh ! Donna, let&#39;s tell him it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a much more believable loser.
 <br>
 Oh, come on.
 <br>
 He won&#39;t judge you.
 <br>
 He loves you.
 <br>
 I mean, jeez, he asked you to prom.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s see donna.
 <br>
 What a pleasant pleasant surprise.
 <br>
 Jeez, you&#39;ve done something different with your hair since the prom.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You noticed.
 <br>
 Well, I notice everything about all my students.
 <br>
 I put on a little weight.
 <br>
 And you are ? Eric.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 improved mathlete.
 <br>
 Oh, right.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, eric.
 <br>
 I I just figured the bullies had gotten ya.
 <br>
 Anyway, donna here is looking for some college scholarships.
 <br>
 Well, donna, you&#39;ve come to the right place, because I am an expert at college scholarships as well as the affairs of the heart.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you have just a little seat right here, young lady ? Thank you.
 <br>
 Uh I guess I&#39;ll, um great.
 <br>
 So, donna, to figure out what scholarships you&#39;re eligible for, I&#39;ll have to know what you&#39;ve done for the last year.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Um, well, not a lot.
 <br>
 I read comic books acted out movies with my dolls action figures ! You always insist that they are called action figures.
 <br>
 Jeez, that&#39;s you know, if eric had told me he had wasted a whole year of his life, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, but but you ? I know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just as surprised as you are.
 <br>
 It has been a long, ugly fall.
 <br>
 Very hard to watch.
 <br>
 In fact, just between you and me, she&#39;s even gotten into a little bit of the smokey-smokey.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Screw this.
 <br>
 The scholarship is for him.
 <br>
 Eric, good luck.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Bray, my coming here was not an invitation to start driving by my house again.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, my mother lives right next door.
 <br>
 I live right next door.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well how&#39;s mother ? Oh, my god ! You guys, I just got a promotion.
 <br>
 Daddy says I&#39;ve been doing such a great job that he wants me to move to milwaukee and help run the corporate office.
 <br>
 Wait, what about steven ? He&#39;s the one doing the great job.
 <br>
 You just sit around doing your nails and making smart-ass comments.
 <br>
 Jackie, that&#39;s you.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s annoying, now isn&#39;t it ? How did you get a promotion ? You don&#39;t know anything about music.
 <br>
 Last week a guy came in asking for kiss.
 <br>
 You called him a pervert and slapped him in the face.
 <br>
 Well, did your dad say anything about steven ? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I just heard the word &#34;promotion,&#34; and I got a little dizzy and sort of blacked out.
 <br>
 It was awesome.
 <br>
 Well, here&#39;s the america I know the person who can&#39;t do anything rises to the top, while the guy who&#39;s working his ass off gets nothing.
 <br>
 Are you supposed to be the guy that works his ass off ? Don&#39;t make this more complicated than it has to be.
 <br>
 Jackie ! Listen, I need some advice on breaking up with girls, okay ? And you&#39;ve been broken up with a lot, and several times by me.
 <br>
 So what didn&#39;t you like ? Oh, um, the lying, the cheating, the sneaking around.
 <br>
 Oh, and I also didn&#39;t like fez trying to make out with me five minutes later.
 <br>
 Well, then you&#39;re really not gonna like this.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t know how to break up with angie.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t you try to figure out how to do it kindly, maturely, respectfully ? Yeah.
 <br>
 - That sounds nice.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m just gonna sleep with her best friend.
 <br>
 Okay, I actually got some great news from the guidance counselor.
 <br>
 There&#39;s this program where you go and teach in an impoverished area for a year, and then they pay for your college.
 <br>
 I  signed up.
 <br>
 - Eric, that&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s wonderful ! See ? I knew spending your college money would work out for the best.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 So what impoverished area will you go to ? is it east milwaukee ? I  made a wrong turn there once, and I ended up in an awful neighborhood.
 <br>
 There were kids playing radios on a street corner.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not going to milwaukee.
 <br>
 So where then ? Africa ! Africa, Wisconsin ? you&#39;re going to teach in africa ? What are you gonna teach &#39;em, how to get eaten by an ostrich ? Mom, an ostrich ? I saw a documentary.
 <br>
 They are vicious, cruel creatures.
 <br>
 Well, I think it&#39;s great he&#39;s going to africa.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll make him a man.
 <br>
 You think the only way to become a man is to die.
 <br>
 How are you gonna feel when your son gets killed by a lion or a disease-carrying fly ? You get killed by a fly, I&#39;m not buying you a headstone.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t go to africa.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t even have ketchup there.
 <br>
 You put ketchup on everything.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll starve to death.
 <br>
 Can you believe how much she&#39;s freaking out ? No.
 <br>
 I cannot believe that someone you supposedly love is upset that you decided to go to africa without considering her feelings at all ! See ? Donna understands.
 <br>
 so there&#39;s a problem with my &#34;sleeping with angie&#39;s best friend&#34; plan.
 <br>
 Angie&#39;s best friend is hyde.
 <br>
 You know what we may have to do here ? The dark room switch.
 <br>
 You will make love to her in a dark room.
 <br>
 Halfway through, you will excuse yourself.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll come in, pretend to be you and finish the job.
 <br>
 And how does that fix my problem ? Oh.
 <br>
 I was working on my problem.
 <br>
 You guys, donna&#39;s totally freaking out about this africa thing.
 <br>
 She won&#39;t return any of my calls.
 <br>
 Think I have a solution.
 <br>
 The dark room switch.
 <br>
 Look, man, tell donna to just lay off, okay ? Africa is gonna be awesome.
 <br>
 You know, they have this bug over there that burrows into your brain, and it lays, like, a thousand eggs.
 <br>
 And then when the eggs hatch, they, like, shoot out of your head like little worm bullets.
 <br>
 Kelso, those worms aren&#39;t in africa.
 <br>
 They&#39;re on the planet zorgon, which is from a comic book that you wrote.
 <br>
 Just trying to generate a little buzz.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 , What the hell were you thinking ? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I thought I&#39;d try a new thing with my shoulders.
 <br>
 Look, he means, why did you promote that whore angie ? You mean my daughter angie.
 <br>
 I stand by my statement.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t hit a girl.
 <br>
 Look, if this is about me not being professional, I&#39;ve already told you bottle rocket friday nights are over.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;m moving angie to milwaukee to get her away from the customers.
 <br>
 I love my little girl, but you&#39;re the one who should be running that store.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s yours.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Uh,  thanks, man.
 <br>
 Oh, my god ! I own a record store ! No, i own a record store.
 <br>
 Actually, i own a record store.
 <br>
 I own one-third of a record store ! Moving angie here is gonna work out for everybody.
 <br>
 See, I just got into this real snooty country club, and they don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna be there much.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m gonna be there all day, every day.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m bringing friends.
 <br>
 So I need somebody around here looking after things while I&#39;m out making white people uncomfortable.
 <br>
 hello ? Oh, hi.
 <br>
 How are ya ? I&#39;m eric&#39;s guidance counselor.
 <br>
 I just came over with some papers for him.
 <br>
 You look familiar.
 <br>
 Do you live around here ? &#39;Cause I see you drive up and down the street all the time.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I see you emptying your trash in your bathrobe all the time, but I keep it to myself, okay ? Eric, I brought you a brochure with some survival tips, on africa.
 <br>
 Funny, they don&#39;t have brochures with survival tips on wisconsin.
 <br>
 That&#39;s because death isn&#39;t hiding behind every bush.
 <br>
 Mom, please.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry if eric&#39;s trip has upset anyone.
 <br>
 It&#39;s upset everyone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not upset.
 <br>
 I&#39;m tickled pink.
 <br>
 What about donna ? How&#39;s donna doing ? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not even talking to me.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you know, sometimes I think she just kind of lets her fiery emotions get the best of her.
 <br>
 But I think maybe a gentle word from me might just calm her down or send her into the arms of someone else.
 <br>
 You know what ? You&#39;re not gonna talk to her.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go talk to her.
 <br>
 so do you guys have a daughter ? Angie I&#39;ve been thinking about this all day, and I finally worked up the nerve.
 <br>
 And I think we need to talk about us.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;m breaking up with you.
 <br>
 How dare you ?! I&#39;m moving to milwaukee.
 <br>
 Milwau well, when were you gonna tell me, you know, your boyfriend ? Come on.
 <br>
 You know things were sort of fizzling anyways.
 <br>
 F-fizzling ? How can you even say that ? What about all the times you said that I was really, really good-looking ? Michael, it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 But know this when I said you were good-looking, I really meant it.
 <br>
 You know what ? You got a lot of growing up to do ! Hey.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you &#34;hey&#34; me.
 <br>
 My daughter stayed home from college for you.
 <br>
 She could have had a bright future.
 <br>
 Sure, she wouldn&#39;t be president of a company or anything &#39;cause she&#39;s a gal, but she would have been one hell of a secretary ! Okay, look, donna, I know you&#39;re upset eric, if you wanna break up with me, just go ahead and do it.
 <br>
 What ? No ! Donna, I&#39;m not breaking up with you.
 <br>
 Really ? Well, did you consider me at all before you decided to run away to africa ? Okay, look, donna, the reason I&#39;m doing this is for us, okay ? So I can go to college and get a job, you know, so I can deserve you.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t give me that crap.
 <br>
 You&#39;re doing it for you.
 <br>
 Donna, when my dad got sick, and I had to stay at home, I thought I&#39;d missed my only chance.
 <br>
 But  this is it.
 <br>
 This is my second chance.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re always saying how I gotta get out of this town, how I gotta start my life.
 <br>
 Donna, I thought if anyone was gonna support me in this, it was gonna be you.
 <br>
 So good.
 <br>
 Go start it.
 <br>
 Look, I really just don&#39;t wanna fight about this.
 <br>
 What do you wanna do ? Movie ? And then what ? Um, I vote the thing we usually do after a movie.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the point of that ? Well, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I think that&#39;s really its own reward.
 <br>
 I think you need to leave.
 <br>
 - Donna, I&#39;m not - she said get out.
 <br>
 I know, &#39;cause I was listening the whole time.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You still got me, cupcake.
 <br>
 Thanks, dad.
 <br>
 If it makes you feel any better, he&#39;s gonna be sorry.
 <br>
 I read someplace that in africa, they got a bug that burrows in your brain and shoots out your eyes like worm bullets.
 <br>
 Okay, angie, kelso feels that you two should have one last night together, and he wants it to be special.
 <br>
 So it will take place in this dark room.
 <br>
 And for a minute you may think, &#34;hey, this is not kelso !&#34; But that&#39;s just the liquor talking.
 <br>
 I forgot to mention you will need to drink a lot of liquor.
 <br>
 You going to get the liquor now ? Okay, I&#39;ll wait.
 <br>
 <br>
