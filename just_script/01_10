 Damn! Kelso misses another one.
 <br>
 I believe that&#39;s H-O-R.
 <br>
 You are a whore.
 <br>
 No, the game is Horse.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You know what, Michael? I&#39;m gonna go home.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna do my homework.
 <br>
 You do your homework on a Saturday night? Yeah.
 <br>
 Look, I mean, look at me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a 1,000-word term paper due Monday but you don&#39;t see me sweating.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve got a whole crappy Sunday to do it.
 <br>
 - Jackie, don&#39;t go home.
 <br>
 I mean, Steve Martin&#39;s hosting Saturday Night.
 <br>
 I hate that show, okay? They have commercials that you think are real but they&#39;re not real.
 <br>
 And then you wanna buy the stuff.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 See you, Michael.
 <br>
 Bye! Bye-bye! Shut up.
 <br>
 Kelso, Jackie does her homework on Saturday night.
 <br>
 That&#39;s so hip.
 <br>
 You guys don&#39;t have to worry about Jackie anymore &#39;cause I&#39;m breaking up with her.
 <br>
 We are so tired of hearing you say that.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I am.
 <br>
 I&#39;m breaking up with her.
 <br>
 Yeah, when? I&#39;m picking my moment.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Fez? Make that shot, whore.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah.
 <br>
 Hello, Wisconsin! Now, aren&#39;t the waffles extra delicious this wonderful morning? Did you quit smoking again? And why do you ask, little one? You&#39;re talking like Snow White, so I figured Eric! Which is great, I really want you to quit.
 <br>
 I should&#39;ve quit a long time ago.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a nurse.
 <br>
 I know better.
 <br>
 More sausage? I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 Hello? That&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 Be glad to.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 See you soon.
 <br>
 Goodbye.
 <br>
 - Who was that, dear? - My mother.
 <br>
 Seems like Uncle Paul broke his ankle and she&#39;s going to church with us today.
 <br>
 No, she&#39;s not.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s Paul&#39;s turn to take her.
 <br>
 - Like I said, he broke his ankle.
 <br>
 Broken ankle, whatever.
 <br>
 It&#39;s his turn.
 <br>
 - Kitty, the man is injured.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 That is just great.
 <br>
 I will just take a chicken out of the freezer because queen Bernice doesn&#39;t like ham.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I&#39;ll just call her and tell her we can&#39;t make it.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 You know who&#39;ll get blamed for that.
 <br>
 Why should she blame you? She&#39;s my mother.
 <br>
 Something she never lets me forget.
 <br>
 Look, you could tell her I&#39;m sick or something.
 <br>
 Eric, go upstairs and put on that shirt your grandmother gave you.
 <br>
 Eric, just stay there.
 <br>
 Your mother is just being ridiculous.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s ridiculous, is giving your mother our phone number.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s being ridiculous is - Hold it.
 <br>
 Hold it.
 <br>
 Now, look let&#39;s just stay calm.
 <br>
 Mom, if it&#39;ll help you out, I&#39;ll hang out with Grandma so she&#39;ll leave you alone.
 <br>
 What do you say? First of all, Eric, I&#39;m the one who says &#34;hold it.
 <br>
 &#34; When you pay the bills, you get to say &#34;hold it.
 <br>
 &#34; Now get in the car, &#39;cause we&#39;re going to church and we&#39;re gonna have a damn nice Sunday.
 <br>
 You&#39;re damn right.
 <br>
 Just try and stop me.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 Here she comes.
 <br>
 God, Red, I don&#39;t think I can do this.
 <br>
 - Kitty, do us all a favor and light up.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Careful, Grandma.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just my dress.
 <br>
 It&#39;s nice to see you, Bernice.
 <br>
 I hate this car.
 <br>
 You know, I just hate this car.
 <br>
 Your brother Jerry has a beautiful car.
 <br>
 A Lincoln.
 <br>
 But then, he makes more money, a lot more money than you do.
 <br>
 All righty, then.
 <br>
 So, Kitty, Eric tells me that you quit smoking.
 <br>
 Yes, I did quit.
 <br>
 And I just I feel great.
 <br>
 Good for you, dear.
 <br>
 In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
 <br>
 Amen.
 <br>
 Please stand for a moment of silent meditation.
 <br>
 Dear God.
 <br>
 Thank you so much for helping me quit such a filthy, disgusting soothing, delicious habit.
 <br>
 God, I can&#39;t do this.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Amen.
 <br>
 Dear God what&#39;s with all the Polacks? Dear God.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t mean to bother you on your day off but I promised to help out with Grandma and I have a term paper due tomorrow.
 <br>
 If you could either get her to leave early today or burn down the school tomorrow.
 <br>
 I mean, either or, God&#39;s choice.
 <br>
 It&#39;d really help me out, man.
 <br>
 God.
 <br>
 Lord.
 <br>
 Amen.
 <br>
 Dear Lord.
 <br>
 Would it kill you to give the Packers a winning season? Amen.
 <br>
 And watch over my loving family blah, blah, blah.
 <br>
 Welcome to Worship for Shutins.
 <br>
 Change it.
 <br>
 All right, change that.
 <br>
 - How did we change channels before Fez? - I don&#39;t think we did.
 <br>
 - You guys, I gotta work on my term paper.
 <br>
 - Where&#39;s Grandma? She&#39;s in the bathroom, so I&#39;ve got, like, - What&#39;s the assignment? - All right.
 <br>
 &#34;In 1,000 words describe the three branches &#34;of the United States government and their functions.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;ll never make it.
 <br>
 Go up and tell them you have homework to do.
 <br>
 No, I wanna keep peace in the family.
 <br>
 Yeah, Donna, Forman wants the Hallmark card family.
 <br>
 - The what? - You know, Grandma comes over.
 <br>
 To my mother-in-law on this beautiful Sunday.
 <br>
 Your smiling face your kind embrace has made my home a happy place.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re the one to whom I gave my loving son.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re both happy &#39;cause otherwise life would be crappy.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want that.
 <br>
 Yeah, you do.
 <br>
 I can see it in those wide, hopeful eyes.
 <br>
 But the reality is this: To my daughter-in-law, you took my son.
 <br>
 You wrecked my life.
 <br>
 You stole my youth.
 <br>
 You hate my wife.
 <br>
 I do my best.
 <br>
 Now, that&#39;s a joke.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going out.
 <br>
 I need a smoke.
 <br>
 Damn it, Eric! Quit hiding from your grandmother.
 <br>
 She&#39;s old, she could die.
 <br>
 Now, move it! I thought she was in the bathroom.
 <br>
 False alarm.
 <br>
 Look, go take care of your grandmother.
 <br>
 We can do this.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 - All right, how many words does he have? - His name, the date, the class.
 <br>
 Seven.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s screwed.
 <br>
 - Use his middle name.
 <br>
 See? Now, this would never happen to me.
 <br>
 That is why I do my homework on Saturday.
 <br>
 This is a moment, Kelso.
 <br>
 Pick it.
 <br>
 I think you all could learn something from me right now.
 <br>
 Moment number two.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Jackie, we need to talk.
 <br>
 You know what? I did the same paper last year in history.
 <br>
 I think I got an &#34;A.
 <br>
 &#34; You want me to go home and get it? - Let me think.
 <br>
 Yeah! - Hold on, Donna.
 <br>
 Jackie, we need to talk about this whole Jackie, why don&#39;t you go ahead? Okay.
 <br>
 Do not break up with her yet, you understand me? Say you understand me.
 <br>
 All this time I thought you didn&#39;t like Jackie.
 <br>
 Just don&#39;t break up with her yet.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 What do I need Jackie for, man? I know more about this stuff than she does.
 <br>
 The three true branches of the government are military, corporate, and Hollywood.
 <br>
 I need a pencil.
 <br>
 I got it.
 <br>
 Jackie, run! Love! I hope you&#39;re hungry.
 <br>
 Yup, the chicken will be done soon.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t eat chicken.
 <br>
 You know I have an irritable bowel.
 <br>
 You should have made a ham.
 <br>
 Boy, Grandma that was a great service this morning.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you think? I think the pastor talked too much about forgiveness.
 <br>
 Some people shouldn&#39;t be forgiven.
 <br>
 This is why theology is such a rich You know, Bernice, some people don&#39;t need forgiveness they just need a little understanding.
 <br>
 Too true.
 <br>
 Have you seen Godspell? You know, what I don&#39;t understand is how in hell a brilliant young man, like my Red could have thrown away everything.
 <br>
 Grandma! Why don&#39;t we go into the living room and I&#39;ll rub your feet.
 <br>
 What a wonderful boy.
 <br>
 Look at how thin you are.
 <br>
 Is your mother feeding you enough? You should come and live with me.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I was just on my way to the garage.
 <br>
 To fix this.
 <br>
 Dad, just watch your game.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s just the Packers.
 <br>
 - Eric, where&#39;ve you been hiding? - I&#39;ve been doing some homework.
 <br>
 That&#39;s important.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know, actually, it&#39;s a really interesting Eric, a little less talk and a little more rubbing.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the only one who&#39;s not afraid of my bunion.
 <br>
 Oh, dear.
 <br>
 Good-bye, Eric, I am going home now.
 <br>
 No, wait, Fez, you haven&#39;t met Grandma.
 <br>
 Hello, Grandma.
 <br>
 In my village, we worship feet.
 <br>
 And these dogs are a holy treasure.
 <br>
 - You wanna rub them? - May I? Knock yourself out.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 Damn it, Eric! Don&#39;t sneak up on a person like that when they&#39;re doing this.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going in there? - I rubbed her feet.
 <br>
 - Now, you&#39;re a brave one.
 <br>
 Better get back in there.
 <br>
 Dad, you coming back inside? Eric I love your grandmother very, very much.
 <br>
 I just can&#39;t talk to her or spend any time with her.
 <br>
 Did I mention that I&#39;m in there rubbing her feet? You know, son sometimes you&#39;ve just gotta play through the pain.
 <br>
 What? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Just get back in there.
 <br>
 - Yeah, right.
 <br>
 &#34;With their sugar-coated ideals &#34;designed to anesthetize the ignorant masses.
 <br>
 &#34;Why? So that the military slash corporate branches &#34;can carry out world domination.
 <br>
 &#34; All right, read that back to me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 - You didn&#39;t get that? - All right, let&#39;s just use the encyclopedia.
 <br>
 You just want to vomit up facts from an encyclopedia? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You know what? Vomit away.
 <br>
 I will not be a part of this, then.
 <br>
 Eric, are you down here? He&#39;s not down here, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Donna, good, why don&#39;t you come up and eat with us? I need all the help I can get.
 <br>
 Not you, Steven.
 <br>
 Grandma doesn&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 Lucky bastard.
 <br>
 What am I supposed to eat? You know, help yourself to the deep freeze.
 <br>
 But everything&#39;s frozen.
 <br>
 And I have a dryer.
 <br>
 Honey, these cheesy potatoes are delicious.
 <br>
 Thank you, honey.
 <br>
 They really are great, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 We have them whenever Grandma comes over &#39;cause mom knows how much she loves them.
 <br>
 Right, Grandma? They make me sick.
 <br>
 I&#39;m allergic to dairy.
 <br>
 How sad.
 <br>
 Ma, this is Wisconsin.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not allergic to dairy.
 <br>
 Maybe she&#39;s just allergic to my dairy.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re allergic to dairy you shouldn&#39;t put cream in your coffee.
 <br>
 - I mean, cream is dairy.
 <br>
 - Donna, just, no, okay? You shut up, Eric! Who the hell are you? Grandma, that&#39;s Donna, you&#39;ve known her for 16 years.
 <br>
 I have not.
 <br>
 Anyway, I like your new friend better.
 <br>
 The feeling is mutual.
 <br>
 Done.
 <br>
 I heard a noise in the garage.
 <br>
 Raccoons.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 I couldn&#39;t eat another bite.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve had enough.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going back downstairs.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 So, what say we watch Lawrence Welk, Grandma? No, I&#39;m going to watch Lawrence Welk with my new friend.
 <br>
 You up for another foot rub, Desi? Fry time.
 <br>
 - Hot! Hot! - What are you doing? Just working on your report here, and having some fries.
 <br>
 Wait, you put French fries in my mom&#39;s dryer? Yeah, the fish sticks are too flaky, so I just I don&#39;t even need to Finally.
 <br>
 Where have you guys been? We had to look for the paper, and eat and then some stuff happened, you know.
 <br>
 - Your shirt&#39;s on inside out.
 <br>
 - Yeah, that&#39;s the stuff.
 <br>
 - Where&#39;s the paper? - Right.
 <br>
 Okay, see? It wasn&#39;t on the three branches of the government it was on the four food groups.
 <br>
 Okay, look, my dad&#39;s got the World Books.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just run next door and get &#34;G.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;ll go with you.
 <br>
 You can break up with her now.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m tired of everybody trying to tear me and Jackie apart.
 <br>
 Moron, every day you say you&#39;re breaking up with her.
 <br>
 You guys don&#39;t know her like I do.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s not just about fooling around.
 <br>
 She buys me stuff.
 <br>
 She hoovered your chest, man.
 <br>
 You know what? I don&#39;t care anymore.
 <br>
 All I wanted was a little help with my paper and you&#39;ve done nothing! We put your middle name in.
 <br>
 Jean-Claude? That&#39;s two words.
 <br>
 You guys suck.
 <br>
 Just thank God for Donna.
 <br>
 Okay, bad news, my mom sold some out at the garage sale.
 <br>
 But we have &#34;B,&#34; &#34;X,&#34; and &#34;R.
 <br>
 &#34; All right.
 <br>
 Now, you listen up.
 <br>
 I have had an extremely stressful day.
 <br>
 And I am not proud of what I&#39;m about to say but someone give me a cigarette! Now! But, Mom, we don&#39;t smoke.
 <br>
 Cut the crap, Eric.
 <br>
 I am a nurse.
 <br>
 I know that one in five teenagers smoke.
 <br>
 One, two, three, four, five.
 <br>
 Now, I&#39;m going to close my eyes, and when I open them there had better be a cigarette between these two fingers.
 <br>
 Come on, people.
 <br>
 Hop to! Thank you.
 <br>
 Light? Kitty.
 <br>
 There you are, Red.
 <br>
 Ma says the cat bit her, so I&#39;m down here looking for it.
 <br>
 Dad, we don&#39;t have a cat.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I thought.
 <br>
 You know, we really We shouldn&#39;t leave your poor little foreign friend up there alone with Grandma.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really kind of nice down here.
 <br>
 Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
 <br>
 - You are so very welcome.
 <br>
 - I hope I wasn&#39;t any bother.
 <br>
 Ma, you&#39;re no bother.
 <br>
 You&#39;re as welcome as flowers in May.
 <br>
 Bernice, here, I wrapped up some chicken for you to take home.
 <br>
 Thank you, dear.
 <br>
 And I hope you put some of those cheesy potatoes in there.
 <br>
 You know how much I love them.
 <br>
 What? I thought you made such a big deal about how you were allergic to Eric! This has been a perfectly nice Sunday.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not spoil it.
 <br>
 Sweetheart I hope I didn&#39;t make too big a deal about my allergy.
 <br>
 No, Ma, he&#39;s a kid.
 <br>
 He overreacts.
 <br>
 You know, this is the cutest little car.
 <br>
 I just love it.
 <br>
 Eight hundred and twenty-five, eight hundred and twenty-six Eric, what are you doing? It&#39;s 1:00 in the morning.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just finishing up some homework.
 <br>
 What are you doing down here? Snow White came down to gun a stick.
 <br>
 Look, Mom, I wish you wouldn&#39;t smoke.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 This is my last one.
 <br>
 I promise.
 <br>
 By the way thanks for your help with your grandma today.
 <br>
 Can I ask you a question? What does she have against you, Mom? Well About 25 years ago, your father was dating this very attractive, well-to-do woman that your grandma liked and he married me instead.
 <br>
 And she never forgave me.
 <br>
 That bitch.
 <br>
 Now, who was the lady with the cotton-candy dress? That&#39;s Norma Zimmer, the champagne lady.
 <br>
 She is very talented.
 <br>
 And you see those two dancing? That&#39;s Bobby and Sissy.
 <br>
 I like his tight pants, but she&#39;s a slut.
 <br>
 You know, I have seen this show before.
 <br>
 But the band leader&#39;s voice was much more masculine.
 <br>
 Bubbles!
