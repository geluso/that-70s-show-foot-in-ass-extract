<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Okay, boys.
 <br>
 I brought cheese samples from work.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong with them? Nothing.
 <br>
 Well, they were in the trash.
 <br>
 - Cool.
 <br>
 - Hand it over.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 You know how my brother locks me in the closet with a pillowcase full of dead fish until the stink makes me cry? Well, while I was in there, I heard him make a phone call.
 <br>
 And it seems that he&#39;s got a little surprise for Donna tonight- the honeymoon suite at that French motel in Kenosha.
 <br>
 The Le Motel? Oh, no, it sounds like Donna and Casey are going to ie do it.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s gonna freak out when we tell him.
 <br>
 - And why would we tell him? - To watch him freak out.
 <br>
 Kelso, he&#39;s gonna take it really hard, man.
 <br>
 - So we just need to keep our mouths shut.
 <br>
 - Wow.
 <br>
 That&#39;s very considerate of Eric&#39;s feelings.
 <br>
 What the hell, man? I just think we all need to zip it, especially you.
 <br>
 Hey, I can keep a secret.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t tell Kelso you took five bucks from his wallet.
 <br>
 Hyde! None of you guys can keep a secret.
 <br>
 Well, you sure can, especially when it&#39;s about you kissing other guys.
 <br>
 Michael, it was one guy from work, and I told you I &#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 God, how long are you gonna keep throwing that in my face? Well, how long are you gonna keep throwing your face in other guys&#39; faces? Wow.
 <br>
 That was clever.
 <br>
 I think I won that! Yeah! Oh, Eric.
 <br>
 [ Sighs ] Let me just say I &#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - For what? - I can&#39;t tell you.
 <br>
 But if you were to guess that Casey is taking Donna to a honeymoon suite I&#39;d say, &#34;Good guess.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39; Wait.
 <br>
 Casey and Donna got a motel room? Yeah, but look at the bright side.
 <br>
 Donna and Casey may be doing it but at least they&#39;re doing it on a vibrating, heart-shaped bed.
 <br>
 If you see what I mean.
 <br>
 Well, I do now thanks to your spot-on, detailed description.
 <br>
 Oh, and there&#39;ll probably be a mirror too.
 <br>
 Okay, thanks, Fez.
 <br>
 - You know, so they can watch each other.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 [ Clears Throat ] I &#39;d like to propose a toast.
 <br>
 My divorce papers finally came through.
 <br>
 - To divorce! - Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re gonna drink to divorce, drink alone in the dark like regular sad people.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not sad.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy &#39;cause now I can do all kinds of things I couldn&#39;t do before, like, uh- Joanne, we could get married.
 <br>
 [ Forced Laughter ] Somethin&#39; funny? Bob, we&#39;ve never mentioned marriage before.
 <br>
 You spring it on me now in front of strangers? Oh, excuse me.
 <br>
 My mistake, I guess.
 <br>
 I guess I hurt someone&#39;s feelings.
 <br>
 Well, you certainly did.
 <br>
 We are not strangers! So, what are you and Casey doin&#39; tonight? He won&#39;t tell me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a surprise.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, it&#39;s blush, not spray paint.
 <br>
 A surprise, huh? What if the surprise is something big? Are you ready for it? I mean, how do you really feel about Casey? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Well, how do you feel about his hair? Love it.
 <br>
 Lots of body.
 <br>
 - And his body? - Love it.
 <br>
 Lots of hair.
 <br>
 - How about his car? - I love it.
 <br>
 Trans Ams kick ass.
 <br>
 So hair, body and car.
 <br>
 The big three- the Holy Trinity of Love.
 <br>
 Okay, I think you&#39;re ready for your big surprise.
 <br>
 Jackie, what is this big surprise? All I can tell you is definitely- definiteiy shave those legs.
 <br>
 Well, I called the Le Motel.
 <br>
 Fez, you were right.
 <br>
 Casey has a reservation for tonight.
 <br>
 And, Hyde, you were right.
 <br>
 I cannot keep a secret.
 <br>
 Speaking of secrets, look what I found in Jackie&#39;s cheese.
 <br>
 Some guy Phil&#39;s phone number.
 <br>
 I -I can&#39;t take this anymore.
 <br>
 I just know it, Hyde.
 <br>
 She&#39;s cheatin&#39; on me again.
 <br>
 Kelso, don&#39;t jump to conclusions.
 <br>
 Maybe I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Forman, man, you gotta be cool about this Donna thing or she&#39;s gonna know you&#39;re jealous.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t be all Simon and Garfunkely.
 <br>
 You gotta get Bruce Springsteeny.
 <br>
 Springsteenian.
 <br>
 Springsteenicious.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 What are we talking about? Whoa.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys, I &#39;m not jealous.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just looking out for her.
 <br>
 I mean, Donna&#39;s practically a sister to me.
 <br>
 A tall, shapely sister who I&#39;ve done it with about a million times.
 <br>
 Look, maybe Donna and Casey won&#39;t even do it tonight.
 <br>
 I&#39;d call it 50-50.
 <br>
 You would? Oh, I&#39;d be wrong.
 <br>
 But I&#39;d call it that to keep you from doing somethin&#39; stupid.
 <br>
 Forman, you gotta do somethin&#39; stupid.
 <br>
 Sittin&#39; around feeling helpless all day- That isn&#39;t healthy.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I&#39;m gonna stalk Jackie.
 <br>
 You know, I really love things with holes.
 <br>
 Swiss cheese, doughnuts, inner tubes.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what it is about a hole.
 <br>
 It just feels good.
 <br>
 [Man Singing Rock ] -  [ Continues, Indistinct ] - [ Ringing ] Hello? Is Phil there? - Who? - Phil! Some guy you kissed! I found his number in your cheese! Michael, Phil&#39;s the guy who delivers the sausage.
 <br>
 You tramp! No, idiot.
 <br>
 He brings food to our store.
 <br>
 He&#39;s our sausage guy.
 <br>
 Tramp! [ Continues On Radio ] Wait- Who&#39;s that singing? Who&#39;s singing love songs to you? Peter Frampton.
 <br>
 Are you kissing him? - No! - [Handset Slams In Cradle ] - [ Ringing] - Are you sure? - [ Ringing ] - Hello? Hello, this is Norman.
 <br>
 Shall we kiss? Okay, Red, what Bob needs right now is a good friend.
 <br>
 And since I don&#39;t know where we&#39;re gonna find one, you need to talk to him.
 <br>
 - Kitty- - Or you can talk to Joanne.
 <br>
 I &#39;ll take Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take Joanne.
 <br>
 Donna, I have to talk to you! Leo? Have you got Donna in there? You know, I didn&#39;t think to ask.
 <br>
 Look, I have to find Donna.
 <br>
 Casey&#39;s gonna surprise her with the honeymoon suite.
 <br>
 And I know Donna.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not gonna like that kind of surprise.
 <br>
 So she&#39;ll probably be looking for an out, so I&#39;m here to rescue her.
 <br>
 Kind of like Luke did with Leia in Star Wars.
 <br>
 You know, &#34;I&#39;m here to rescue you!&#34; The other honeymoon suite&#39;s across the hall, man.
 <br>
 Now, ifyou&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve got a game of Twister I gotta stretch for.
 <br>
 [Donna Chuckies ] Casey, check it out.
 <br>
 They have tiny soaps.
 <br>
 What am I doing? I couldn&#39;t do it, Leo.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s havin&#39; a good time.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t wanna be rescued.
 <br>
 But you know what? The thing is, I still wanna go in there and stop everything, you know? I didn&#39;t come here for her.
 <br>
 I came here for me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a huge dilemma, man.
 <br>
 But you know what you really gotta ask yourself? Is there anybody who&#39;s not in a motel room with three women that you could tell this to? Okay, here&#39;s the thing.
 <br>
 Bob really likes you.
 <br>
 Why? Who knows? But that&#39;s America.
 <br>
 Any kook can have any damn fool idea he wants.
 <br>
 Look, I haven&#39;t had good luck with marriage.
 <br>
 When my first husband and I were dating, he was great.
 <br>
 But as soon as I married him, he turned into- well, something like you.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t know what kind of crap your ex-husband used to pull but whatever it was, Bob doesn&#39;t have it in him.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just a nice, loyal guy with a big heart.
 <br>
 He&#39;s perfect for a pushy gal like you.
 <br>
 Well, he does have a big heart.
 <br>
 And we do go well together.
 <br>
 You know, Red, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I &#39;d think you were a good guy.
 <br>
 Well, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I &#39;d think I cared.
 <br>
 The red cheese is chewy.
 <br>
 The red cheese is wax.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hey, guess what, fellas? Turns out I still have feelings for Donna.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Deep feelings.
 <br>
 Warm feelings.
 <br>
 Tingly-in-the-pants feelings.
 <br>
 And I can&#39;t do anything about it, because she has those feelings for someone else.
 <br>
 I think that admitting that you still love Donna is an important step because it reopens the door for this: [ Singsong Voice ] Eric loves Donna! Eric loves Donna! Look, you guys, I don&#39;t love her.
 <br>
 I just think that if she&#39;s not with me the fairest thing for everyone is if she&#39;s alone and unhappy.
 <br>
 No! That is a bad plan, man.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause if you leave a chick alone, the next thing you know she&#39;s lickin&#39; the roof of some other guy&#39;s mouth.
 <br>
 Like the cheese guy.
 <br>
 I hate that guy! But you love his cheese.
 <br>
 See, this is just like a Southern tragedy.
 <br>
 Tennessee Williams, but with cheese.
 <br>
 I &#39;m taking advanced English.
 <br>
 Oh, man, I gotta go to the mall.
 <br>
 I&#39;m late to stalk Jackie.
 <br>
 I just- I can&#39;t believe Donna&#39;s in a motel room with him right now.
 <br>
 Man, I don&#39;t like it either.
 <br>
 [ Clears Throat ] But there is one thing you can do.
 <br>
 I believe you have a stack of Playboys underneath your bed.
 <br>
 Go use &#39;em.
 <br>
 Okay, Bob, I think the problem is that Joanne thinks you&#39;re moving just a little too fast.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just who I am.
 <br>
 I do everything fast.
 <br>
 I run fast.
 <br>
 I drive fast.
 <br>
 I eat fast.
 <br>
 Okay, what happens when you eat fast? I get gassy.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Okay, well, a relationship works the same way.
 <br>
 When it grows too fast, it- it gets gassy too.
 <br>
 And-And- And then the bad thing happens and people leave the room.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 A lot of people have told me to slow down but nobody ever said it in a way that spoke to me.
 <br>
 - Hi, Bob.
 <br>
 - Hey, Joanne.
 <br>
 Okay, well, we&#39;ll just, um- We&#39;ll leave you two alone.
 <br>
 Okay, well, there will be no more marriage talk from Bob.
 <br>
 What? There&#39;d better be.
 <br>
 She&#39;s expecting it! - Oh, crap! - Lock the doors! I &#39;m on it! Michael! What are you doing? - What, are you spying on me now? - [ Nervous Chuckle ] No! Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Yeah, I &#39;m spying on you &#39;cause you&#39;re around strange guys all day and apparently, every once in a while, you up and French one of&#39;em.
 <br>
 Michael, go home.
 <br>
 This is a place of business.
 <br>
 And if you don&#39;t have any business, you&#39;re not welcome at the mall.
 <br>
 Fine! [ No Audible Dialogue ] Stay away from my girlfriend! Michael, what are you doing? Well, I can be at the mall now, &#39;cause I got business.
 <br>
 Train business.
 <br>
 You have lost your mind! Yep, and I don&#39;t miss it! Michael, look at you, riding around on a kiddie train so you can spy on me.
 <br>
 I mean, do you not see how crazy this is? Well, yeah.
 <br>
 But I-I don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m a mess.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t eat.
 <br>
 Well, I can eat.
 <br>
 And then when I eat, I get kind of sleepy.
 <br>
 But I am really upset! Look, ifwe&#39;re ever gonna get past this, you have to forget about that stupid little kiss and just try- try to remember that we love each other.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 - So can we please, please just finally move on? I wanna say yes, but it&#39;s like we&#39;re on this track and we keep going around in circles like some kind of- some kind of- I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I lost my train of thought.
 <br>
 Okay, Forman, what were you doing at the Le Motel last night? And don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t there, because Leo saw you.
 <br>
 Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Leo thinks he saw me at the Le Motel? - [ Sighs ] - Cut the crap, Eric.
 <br>
 You know Casey and I had a room last night so you went there and you pulled the fire alarm all night until we left.
 <br>
 Fire alarm? I didn&#39;t- I didn&#39;t pull- Wait.
 <br>
 You guys left? So you guys didn&#39;t- No! We spent all night in the parking lot with Leo and his hooty mamas.
 <br>
 Eric, what were you even doing at the motel? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I just- I was fine, right? I mean, we were friends, and that was cool.
 <br>
 And now, Donna, all of a sudden it&#39;s like the day after we broke up all over again, and- Look, I&#39;m sorry, but when I knew you were gonna be with Casey, I just- I felt- Whatever.
 <br>
 No, I get it.
 <br>
 Remember when you wanted to date other people, and I was so cool about it? Well, I wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 It, like, broke my heart.
 <br>
 - So what did you do? - Well, I didn&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 - So, I just, you know- - Right.
 <br>
 Casey.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Hey, look, from now on, I &#39;m gonna stay out of your business.
 <br>
 - I promise.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 But before that promise goes into effect I would like it duly noted for the record that I think Casey&#39;s all wrong for you and I think you guys are moving way too fast.
 <br>
 Duly noted.
 <br>
 - And I &#39;ll stay out of your business too.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 So I better, uh, drum me up some business, huh? Still sleepin&#39;, huh? Gosh.
 <br>
 Pulling fire alarms all night must really wear you out.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on to you, buddy.
 <br>
 You did a nice thing, and I&#39;m tellin&#39; everybody.
 <br>
 Oh, man, I didn&#39;t do it to be nice.
 <br>
 I did it because I always wanted to commit a felony.
 <br>
 Misdemeanors just ain&#39;t the rush they used to be.
 <br>
 Well, all I hear is &#34;I love you, I love you, I love you.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39;
