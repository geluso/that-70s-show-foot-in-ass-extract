<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Wow.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t think I was gonna like Kramer vs.
 <br>
 Kramer, but that&#39;s back when I thought we were gonna watch it.
 <br>
 Yeah, for a PG movie there&#39;s a lot of sexual content.
 <br>
 You know, I have noticed something about you.
 <br>
 You only like to make out in secret, dark places.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? Yesterday you drove me half a mile into the woods.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never dated an Italian girl.
 <br>
 I thought I was gonna get whacked! Well it&#39;s just okay I&#39;m a little nervous about telling my friends about us.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the worst thing that could happen if we told them? Okay, let me put it this way.
 <br>
 Two years ago I walked into the basement and my jeans had a hole in the butt.
 <br>
 To this day they call me Poopchute Sally.
 <br>
 Poopchute Sally? Okay let&#39;s go, I don&#39;t want to run into anyone after the movie.
 <br>
 Oehbusted! Wow! Unbelievable.
 <br>
 After all that, she gives the kid back to Dustin Hoffman? That bitch is crazy! That &#39;70s Show Episode 8x13 - Spread Your Wings Transcript : Jill Penders I can&#39;t get over Donna and Randy making out like that.
 <br>
 It was all broad shoulders and blond hair, I could barely tell which one was the boy.
 <br>
 They should save that passion for her bedroom.
 <br>
 Where I have a better view.
 <br>
 I thought it was like watching Donna make out with Forman.
 <br>
 Except Randy wasn&#39;t constantly saying: I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! Well, we&#39;re off to buy curtains for Eric&#39;s room.
 <br>
 We&#39;re making it into a sewing area, so I thought a nice floral print might really pretty it up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all part of our plan to make Eric&#39;s room less girlie.
 <br>
 I wanted to make my room more manly so I put up some posters of the Village People.
 <br>
 Mission accomplished.
 <br>
 Oh oh oh well, I want to get to the fabric store before Mary&#39;s quilting club shows up.
 <br>
 Those fat cows think they own the remnant box.
 <br>
 Oh crap.
 <br>
 I stashed something real important, real illegal up in Forman&#39;s room.
 <br>
 Where&#39;d you hide it? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I was under the influence of it when I hid it.
 <br>
 Oooooh, hey, it&#39;s Donna and Randy.
 <br>
 Where have you guys been.
 <br>
 Donna &amp; Randy? Oh.
 <br>
 Well I was at the park.
 <br>
 Where I was practicing my violin.
 <br>
 For a family of ducks.
 <br>
 I was at home.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s simple.
 <br>
 Really? Cause you know, we went to see Kramer vs.
 <br>
 Kramer, but instead we saw Randy&#39;s hand versus Donna&#39;s bra strap I believe it was directed by Francis Ford Cop-A-Feel.
 <br>
 Donna! Why didn&#39;t you just tell us you were going out with Randy? I don&#39;t know, it was just you know, you guys are friends with Eric and I didn&#39;t know what you&#39;d think.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy for you.
 <br>
 Yeah man, whatever.
 <br>
 Yeah I think it&#39;s great.
 <br>
 I mean you finally found a guy that is stronger then you and that&#39;s hard to do.
 <br>
 Okay, great! Cool, now we can all hang out and it won&#39;t be awkward.
 <br>
 You know, it is this kind of awkwardness reminds me of the time when Dad brought this chick home.
 <br>
 In the morning and she turned out to be a guy.
 <br>
 Although Tony did make me a kick-ass Denver Almond.
 <br>
 Well, I have a question of a theme that&#39;ll make things less awkward.
 <br>
 Randy, when you kiss Donna, is it smooth like melted fudge? Orrough like a cock fight? Fez! Now that is personal! So have you guys had sex yet? Jackie! My money is on no.
 <br>
 Donna is a strong independent woman, who feels that men should respect women for their minds.
 <br>
 In other words, she&#39;s a big fat tease.
 <br>
 Well I think it is going to happen soon.
 <br>
 Because normally Donna only shaves her legs up to her knees.
 <br>
 But this morning, she went all the way from Miami to Jacksonville.
 <br>
 Oh Fez, thank you so much for getting me a job as a hair consultant.
 <br>
 Well I told my boss that you were reliable and hard-working.
 <br>
 Hey there Fez.
 <br>
 Hillary.
 <br>
 I saved you a bite of my cinnamon muffinÂ Oh what a coincidence.
 <br>
 I saved you a bite of my cinnamon bun! Ahhh I would do anything to go out with that hot little number.
 <br>
 Well have you asked her out yet? Well I found that if a man creates mystery, the woman will come to him.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re scared? Terrified.
 <br>
 But I think it is time for you to get to work.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Sooo, okay, the first thing we&#39;re gonna do is  uhm  get rid of these curls cause they kinda make you look like a poodleÂ What the hell are you doing? You are not supposed to talk to the customers! WhaÂI&#39;m the hair consultant! Why I said that to get you down here.
 <br>
 The truth is, you&#39;re our sweep-up girl.
 <br>
 What? No, no no no, that&#39;s the pathetic foreign girl with the wandering eye who sweeps up the hair.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 She&#39;s your boss.
 <br>
 Hm.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve always been curious about somethingÂ.
 <br>
 Heavens! Oh, hey.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t know you guys were starting this early.
 <br>
 It&#39;s two in the afternoon! Yeah that damn school bus bringing home those kids woke me up again.
 <br>
 So uhh you guys find anything interesting? Oh well, I did find this Good Housekeeping under Eric&#39;s bed and apparently he was very interested in self-breast exams.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I think the only thing he was interested in was examining himself.
 <br>
 Oh well Steven, that is a perfectly normal biological function.
 <br>
 And my baby never did that! Hey Red, you need some help? Nah nah, I&#39;m just boxing up some of Eric&#39;s awards.
 <br>
 Ah it was a proud day when he came home with this beauty.
 <br>
 Cub Scout Fair.
 <br>
 Prettiest Non-Functioning Kite.
 <br>
 Uhm Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, my Dad said you had something for me? Oh yes honey.
 <br>
 I found some things I thought you might wanna hold on to.
 <br>
 These are gifts and notes that you gave to Eric and it&#39;s not like I read any of them but you have some potty-mouthÂ Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, likeÂ seriously, Eric and I are through.
 <br>
 Oh honey I know you think that now but he&#39;ll be back soon and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll have one of those talks on the hood of the car, yes I watch! But you&#39;ll be right back together.
 <br>
 No we won&#39;t.
 <br>
 I&#39;m.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I&#39;m moving on.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s not easy, cause I mean everywhere I look something reminds me of Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure this area in particular brings back a lot of memoriesÂ You went out again last night? Yup.
 <br>
 I left a club with a creamy white girl and a chocolaty black girl.
 <br>
 We went home and made hot fudge sundae.
 <br>
 And then we did it.
 <br>
 Uh Fez, why are you lying to her? But you didn&#39;t go out last night! You were lying in front of the TV trying to look up Victoria Principal&#39;s dress.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you have some hair to sweep, sweep up-girl? Huh no.
 <br>
 The place is clean! Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s how the kids are wearing it nowadays.
 <br>
 Happy birthday Eric! I have a sexy surprise for you look across into my window.
 <br>
 Yeah, I thought you liked those.
 <br>
 Now come over here, and I&#39;ll.
 <br>
 Hey! Hey! What&#39;s up? Nothing, just you know.
 <br>
 Hanging out.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Never sat on a hood of a car with a girl before.
 <br>
 Yeah, actually you know what, this car was kind of Ohhh light saber! Yeah that belonged to someone Check it out! I&#39;m Luke Skywalker, I&#39;m here to rescue you! Stop it ! What the hell?! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 This is, this is just too weird.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t do this! I can&#39;t see you anymore! You could&#39;ve just said you didn&#39;t like Star Wars! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you wouldn&#39;t believe the lies Fez tells this girl at work.
 <br>
 I mean he is pretending to be someone else completely.
 <br>
 So what, you pretend to be someone else every time you put on make-up.
 <br>
 I have seen you in the morning, your face looks like scrambled eggs.
 <br>
 Well we all do a little pretending.
 <br>
 Sometimes when I&#39;m bringing in the groceries, I pretend to be Scarlett O&#39;Hara.
 <br>
 And I look at all the brown bags and I say : As God is my witness, I&#39;ll never go hungry again! Oh oh, and sometimes with Red I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Okay well the point is it&#39;s okay to pretend.
 <br>
 Look  I like Hillary and I was afraid that if she knew the real Fez that she wouldn&#39;t like me so I created a new Fez.
 <br>
 A better Fez.
 <br>
 I call this Fez: Work-Fez.
 <br>
 You should see me down there Okay, let&#39;s do this! Whoooo is your man, that would risk his neck for his brother man? Fez! You&#39;re damn right! Who&#39;s the cat that won&#39;t cop out, when there&#39;s danger all about? Fez! Right on! Yo, they say this cat Fez is a bad mother.
 <br>
 Shut your mouth! I&#39;m talking about Fez! Then we can dig it! He&#39;s a complicated man and no-one understands him but his woman.
 <br>
 Work-Fez! I wondered why the last time I came in you said my hair look blackalicious! Hyde, I hope I did the right thing with Randy.
 <br>
 I just feel weird, starting up a new relationship.
 <br>
 Yeah well you know, it&#39;s though when you&#39;ve been with someone for a long time.
 <br>
 Like, just the other day, I heard this burglar alarm, and it was making this really awful high-pitched squealing noise.
 <br>
 I found myself thinking about Jackie.
 <br>
 Well, you know I think I might have hurt Randy&#39;s feelings.
 <br>
 Hi Donna.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Randy is helping me build Kitty&#39;s sewing table.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna make it real nice so she feels obliged to spend hours up here.
 <br>
 Hey Steven, how &#39;bout taking a ride with me down to the lumberyard before they close? No, I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 Nah, you&#39;re coming.
 <br>
 See I know that you hid dope up here.
 <br>
 And if you found it while I was gone, I&#39;d miss that pathetic look on your face when I flush it down the toilet.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a messed up dude.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Come on! So uhmÂRandy I just wanna make sure that you know, I hope we can still be friends.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m cool with that.
 <br>
 Well aren&#39;t you just Beaver freakin&#39; Cleaver!? You want me to be a jerk? Well it would make breaking up with you a lot easier.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t want this to be hard for you.
 <br>
 There you go again.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I won&#39;t say another word! Oh, now you&#39;re gonna show me the muscles?! I&#39;m Randy, I got big muscles! I&#39;m good looking! You&#39;re an ass! So, when are you and I gonna go out and put the fever back in Saturday night? Or Thursday, whenever you&#39;re freeÂ I don&#39;t think I could keep up with you.
 <br>
 OhohohohhhÂ I think you&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 How do you know? Have you guys gone out? Oh God no.
 <br>
 No, we&#39;re just roommates.
 <br>
 Wait, Fez, you told me you had your own place? You called it the Feznasium.
 <br>
 OfÂof course I do! I found this poor thing wandering around the street so I&#39;m letting her stay on pad.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I am teaching her the ways of love.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Hillary, you know what, everything that Fez has told you is a lie.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t go out, he&#39;s in bed by nine! And his idea of a threesome is Neapolitan ice-cream.
 <br>
 Look  Look, I don&#39;t know what she is talking about, this what happens when you hire a girl right off the boat! Oh really?! Okay, here, take a look inside his backpack.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my backpack! &#34;When the phone never rings, a beginners guide to self-love&#34;? Anybody lose a backpack? Hey Donna.
 <br>
 Come here and take a look at this sewing table.
 <br>
 It even got a cup-holder, like Kitty asked.
 <br>
 Now that Randy is a pretty sure-up kid, he build this thing in two days.
 <br>
 The only thing Eric ever made was this crappy bird house.
 <br>
 Oh yeah! He was always too afraid to use the drill so he just painted the hole on there.
 <br>
 Yeah, and one by one, an entire family of bluebirds flew to their deathsÂ Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, what would you think if IÂhypotheticallyÂ possiblyÂmaybeÂstarted dating a new guy? I&#39;d say I think you can do whatever the hell you want.
 <br>
 My dumb-ass son broke up with you.
 <br>
 You are gonna have your own life.
 <br>
 I have absolutely no problem with you dating Randy.
 <br>
 WÂyou know about that? Oh come on.
 <br>
 You&#39;re eyes nearly popped out of your head when you saw him in that tool belt.
 <br>
 Okay cool.
 <br>
 It really means a lot to me that you guys are okay with this.
 <br>
 No no no wait no, I&#39;m okay.
 <br>
 For the love of God, don&#39;t tell Kitty.
 <br>
 I&#39;d have to make her a bigger cup holder! Thanks a lot Jackie.
 <br>
 Now Hillary thinks I&#39;m a crazy self-loving pervert.
 <br>
 Well, she was gonna think that eventually! Fez, I&#39;m confused.
 <br>
 Why have you been lying to me? Well I wanted you to think I was cool, so you&#39;d go out with me, but now you hate me.
 <br>
 Actually, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Before, I was always so intimidated, but now that I know you&#39;re just a regular guy, I&#39;d totally go out with you! Even after you saw my book? You&#39;re lonely.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s cute and endearing.
 <br>
 Uhm I think you mean gross and appalling? Jackie, he&#39;s a lost soul! Someone has to take care of him.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m broken.
 <br>
 Fix me.
 <br>
 Perfect.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just like my grandpa used to say: you measure it twice, everything&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Actually, in his later years, it was all he said.
 <br>
 Hey Red, can you hand me that box of drawer handles? What&#39;s this? Oh ! That&#39;s mine ! OhÂ.
 <br>
 crap.
 <br>
 A macramÃ© owl?! What the hell kinda pansy-ass thing is this?! I do macramÃ©.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my therapy.
 <br>
 Well I didn&#39;t realize you were so stressed outÂ But I think you&#39;ll feel a lot better once you get the sex-change.
 <br>
 There&#39;s my therapy! Hey.
 <br>
 Found your stash? Yep.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m gonna punish it for hiding on me.
 <br>
 By burning it.
 <br>
 Okay look, I&#39;ve been thinking about this and before on the car, I think I might have over-reacted.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that I was in a relationship for a really long time.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s gonna take me a while to get used to something new.
 <br>
 Donna, I get it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 So let&#39;s just you know, take it slow and see where it goes.
 <br>
 I&#39;m cool with that  Poopchute-Sally.
 <br>
 Shut up Oh my god! In Eric&#39;s bedroom? You two-timing whore! Here&#39;s a tissue.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just so sad, how could I drop an entire box of M&amp;M&#39;s on the floor?! Do you want me to go buy you a new one? It was the last one.
 <br>
 <br>
