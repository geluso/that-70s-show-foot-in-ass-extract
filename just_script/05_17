<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Eric, what are you doing eating? Well, it&#39;s mainly for survival.
 <br>
 But I also enjoy the fruity taste.
 <br>
 I told you to replace the hubcap on the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 So, what is it? You&#39;re mature enough to get married but not mature enough to replace a hubcap? Well, let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 You took away my keys, so I can&#39;t drive.
 <br>
 And you took away my job, so I can&#39;t afford a new hubcap.
 <br>
 You also took away my self-esteem, so I have no pride in my job or my possessions.
 <br>
 For gosh sake, you&#39;ve been arguing for two weeks.
 <br>
 Now stop it.
 <br>
 Help me with this crossword puzzle.
 <br>
 I need a four-letter word for disappointment.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 [Gasps] It fits.
 <br>
 Well, now, that can&#39;t be right.
 <br>
 So, he&#39;s like, &#34;Replace the hubcap.
 <br>
 &#34; And I&#39;m like, &#34;Hey, why don&#39;t you replace the hubcap.
 <br>
 &#34; And that is why I&#39;m trimming the hedges.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I only mess with Red when I really need the discipline.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a total hard-ass.
 <br>
 Hard-ass? Take another look, my friend.
 <br>
 It jiggles when he wiggles.
 <br>
 Man, I don&#39;t know what the hell the deal is with Leo.
 <br>
 He told me to take a week off two weeks ago - and I haven&#39;t heard from him since.
 <br>
 - We need to find him &#39;cause we&#39;re all out of film, if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 I need film.
 <br>
 Then I could take pictures of Nina and me doing it.
 <br>
 Fez, film doesn&#39;t really mean &#34;film.
 <br>
 &#34; Who cares? Because for the first time in my life doin&#39; it really means &#34;doin&#39; it.
 <br>
 &#34; So, I guess this is the way an immature, engaged, high school dumb-ass with no car, no job and no money trims the hedges.
 <br>
 That was like eight burns in one sentence.
 <br>
 An octo-burn.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get the hell out of here.
 <br>
 Okay, you two, since you won&#39;t bond on your own I have signed you up for the father/son competition at this year&#39;s Point Place Paul Bunyan Pioneer DayJamboree.
 <br>
 - Kitty, that sounds horrible.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I agree.
 <br>
 You hear that? We&#39;ve already bonded.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s too late.
 <br>
 It&#39;s for charity.
 <br>
 Now, don&#39;t forget your commemorative coonskin caps.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s what you&#39;d look like with hair.
 <br>
 ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] - Hey.
 <br>
 - I&#39;d kiss you but I&#39;m afraid your hat will wake up and scratch my eyes out.
 <br>
 So, you guys, Joanne has been chosen to emcee Pioneer Days.
 <br>
 Tell &#39;em why, baby.
 <br>
 I won the tobacco-spitting contest last year.
 <br>
 What a lady.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be mannin&#39; the hard-cider booth.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a good way to raise money &#39;cause of all the drunks.
 <br>
 Oh! Ooh, people are signing in.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Get excited, you two! Well, howdy, newcomers! I&#39;m Charlie Miller.
 <br>
 You can call me Charlie.
 <br>
 This is my son, Mitch.
 <br>
 You can call me &#34;ladies man.
 <br>
 &#34; - &#34;Ladies man.
 <br>
 &#34; - Did somebody call me? I&#39;m Red Forman.
 <br>
 This is my son, Eric.
 <br>
 You can call him dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Well, we don&#39;t use the A-S-S word.
 <br>
 We have a reputation to uphold.
 <br>
 We&#39;re the two-time champs.
 <br>
 Little secret, Red.
 <br>
 I tell Mitch it doesn&#39;t matter how we do as long as we&#39;re together.
 <br>
 - And why is that, Dad? - &#39;Cause we bad! - Oh, yeah, that&#39;s right! We bad! - We bad! All right.
 <br>
 Dad, they have a catch phrase.
 <br>
 Hey, what&#39;s ours? Shut up, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Shut up, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 No wonder Leo hasn&#39;t told me to come to work.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no work to come to.
 <br>
 - Mmm, did he leave a note? - [Fez] Nope.
 <br>
 Just this.
 <br>
 You know, he looked dirty but he always smelled like clean sheets.
 <br>
 You&#39;re talking about him like he&#39;s gone, man.
 <br>
 He would have told me if he was leaving town.
 <br>
 Maybe a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Appeared.
 <br>
 And it shot down a beam and made everyone and everything inside the Fotohut vanish.
 <br>
 Yeah, like an apparition.
 <br>
 Kelso, you don&#39;t even know what an apparition is.
 <br>
 Hey, if I can&#39;t use words I don&#39;t understand this is gonna be one quiet afternoon.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get started.
 <br>
 &#34;To make room for a new tradin&#39; post &#34;Paul Bunyan needs to clear-cut 200 acres of forest.
 <br>
 The first team to chop And chop! Um, excuse me.
 <br>
 My ax is stuck.
 <br>
 Way to go, Mitch.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right! We bad! - Oh, yeah, we bad! Pull the ax out, Eric.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really stuck in there.
 <br>
 And you think you&#39;re ready to be married.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t even chop wood.
 <br>
 What are you gonna do for heat in the winter, burn comic books? Hmm, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I guess I would probably just turn on the heater! How can Eric and Red be fighting already? Well, it&#39;s almost as if forcing them together against their will and giving them sharp objects wasn&#39;t really the best way to get them to make up.
 <br>
 Another hard cider, Bob.
 <br>
 Make it a double.
 <br>
 Well, we couldn&#39;t find Leo.
 <br>
 We just checked all his hangouts.
 <br>
 - The Hub.
 <br>
 - Alley behind The Hub.
 <br>
 - Fatso Burger.
 <br>
 - Alley behind the Fatso Burger.
 <br>
 Hyde, when are you gonna accept the fact that Leo just bailed? Man, he would not leave without saying good-bye, okay? I know him better than I know my own father.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like to do it with Nina in an alley.
 <br>
 My bare ass pressed up against a cold Dumpster.
 <br>
 You know, we&#39;re getting killed here thanks to your screwing up that last event.
 <br>
 All you had to do was build a cabin out of Lincoln Logs.
 <br>
 Well, I thought I&#39;d score some extra points by building the Millennium Falcon.
 <br>
 The Millennium what? If that&#39;s a Star Wars thing, I&#39;m gonna kick you in the ass.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a Star Wars thing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a very rare falcon that can do the Kessel Run in under six parsecs.
 <br>
 Hey, just remember, guys.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not whether you win or lose.
 <br>
 It&#39;s how you play the game.
 <br>
 Unfortunately, you guys don&#39;t know how to play the game.
 <br>
 Oh, hey.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t wanna rub it in their face they&#39;re big losers.
 <br>
 - Oh! - Oh! I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It just came out.
 <br>
 This is the worst Point Place Paul Bunyan Pioneer Days Jamboree ever.
 <br>
 And now, the cow-milking event.
 <br>
 Could you just award us our first-place points right now? It&#39;d save a lot of time and embarrassment for our friends over here.
 <br>
 You know, it kinda would.
 <br>
 &#34;Babe the Blue Ox needs lots of calcium to carry Paul Bunyan&#39;s lumber &#34;or his brittle bones will snap and he&#39;ll die.
 <br>
 &#34;The first team to fill their barrel with milk and save Babe from osteoporosis wins.
 <br>
 &#34; [Cackling] And milk! - Um, hey! There&#39;s something wrong with our cow.
 <br>
 - [Lowing] Her things aren&#39;t workin&#39;! You can&#39;t just yank on &#39;em.
 <br>
 Red never was much for foreplay.
 <br>
 - Keep it comin&#39;, Mitch.
 <br>
 - This is amazing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like she was waiting for my magic fingers to coax that sweet liquid right out of her teats.
 <br>
 - Move over, Dad.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll show you how it&#39;s done.
 <br>
 - What makes you think- Go, Eric.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 Well, honey, good for you.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Mitch, they&#39;re winning.
 <br>
 What happened to your magic fingers? Get off my back, old man! Dad, here.
 <br>
 [Joanne] Team Forman wins! You let me down, son.
 <br>
 I thought you were better than that.
 <br>
 What are you gonna do? Lock me in the closet again? He locks me in the closet! It&#39;s a walk-in! It&#39;s a walk-in.
 <br>
 So, Dad, what do you say now? Why are you so good at that? How are we gonna break into Leo&#39;s apartment? [Groans] We need a credit card to slip in the door.
 <br>
 Ponch used one on CHiPs once and the lady he rescued was so grateful they did it.
 <br>
 Kelso, if we had a credit card, we could buy a sledgehammer and break down the door.
 <br>
 If we had a credit card, I&#39;d be butt-deep in Jordache right now.
 <br>
 - Oh, Leo, man.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m gonna kick him, see if he&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - Kelso, no.
 <br>
 - Well, at least throw something at him.
 <br>
 If he&#39;s asleep, he&#39;ll wake up.
 <br>
 If he&#39;s dead, you can say you threw something at a dead guy.
 <br>
 Uuh! Aah! Officer, I have a prescription for that.
 <br>
 No, relax, bud.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just looking for Leo.
 <br>
 Oh, he left.
 <br>
 I&#39;m his cousin, Eli.
 <br>
 Really, he just left? He didn&#39;t call or anything? Oh, Steven, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t take it personal, Hyde.
 <br>
 You know Leo never liked phones.
 <br>
 He said he could hear voices in &#39;em.
 <br>
 By the way, he left a note.
 <br>
 Do any of you know a kid named Heidi? He means Hyde.
 <br>
 That&#39;s me, man.
 <br>
 [Excitedly] The note&#39;s for me! [Coolly] I mean, the note&#39;s for me.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] &#34;Dear Hyde, man.
 <br>
 One day I stopped in Point Place for some gas.
 <br>
 &#34;Before I knew it, eight years had passed.
 <br>
 &#34;Whoa.
 <br>
 That rhymes.
 <br>
 &#34;Anyway, I should get home to my wife.
 <br>
 &#34;Take care.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a good kid, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a good kid-man.
 <br>
 &#34; See, I told you he wouldn&#39;t leave without saying good-bye.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, you really do love that old, dirty, little hippie.
 <br>
 And, uh, he left you something else.
 <br>
 He said that you liked &#34;film,&#34; if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I was hoping we could take something home.
 <br>
 Put it in the shirt pocket.
 <br>
 Holy hell! You know, Donna, I&#39;ve been drinking- I mean, thinking.
 <br>
 [Cackling] I want you and Eric to get married.
 <br>
 Okay, even though I know it&#39;s just the cider talking - yea! - [Laughing] &#34;Pioneer Pete is lost in the woods.
 <br>
 &#34;Assemble the map to find his bow and arrow.
 <br>
 &#34;And shoot the bell with the arrow and Pioneer Pete will appear.
 <br>
 Do not shoot Pioneer Pete.
 <br>
 &#34; And go.
 <br>
 - Okay, this one goes here.
 <br>
 - And this piece goes here.
 <br>
 Come on, Mitch.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t give up.
 <br>
 Okay, Mr.
 <br>
 &#34;I Haven&#39;t Had AJob In Five Years.
 <br>
 &#34; - So the bow and arrow are behind the feeding trough! - Go, go, go! - [Dings] - [Both Cheer] Howdy, y&#39;all! I&#39;m Pioneer Pete! Look, Donna.
 <br>
 It&#39;s me, your dad.
 <br>
 Well, Mitch, I hope you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 How can I be happy? Our whole life is a lie.
 <br>
 Am I really supposed to believe that Kathy is my little sister? She doesn&#39;t look anything like me.
 <br>
 She is Cuban, for Pete&#39;s sake! And what about your Friday bowling nights? I looked in your bowling bag.
 <br>
 You know what I found? Butt-less chaps! What&#39;s with the butt-less chaps? Your mother&#39;s inhibited.
 <br>
 [Groaning] [Loud Groan] Don&#39;t shake hands with that guy.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t close my mouth.
 <br>
 Can you close your mouth? It&#39;s really starting to freak me out.
 <br>
 Leo&#39;s the best.
 <br>
 Leo made me a grilled cheese once.
 <br>
 He used butter and made the crust extra toasty.
 <br>
 He forgot cheese.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna miss that grilled-cheese-makin&#39; son of a bitch.
 <br>
 You know, one time, I heard Leo talking on the phone and he was speaking Chinese.
 <br>
 So I said, &#34;Leo, stop speaking Chinese.
 <br>
 &#34; So he turned around, and it wasn&#39;t Leo.
 <br>
 It was a Chinese guy.
 <br>
 [Sighs] You know, I&#39;ll never forget that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just sad I&#39;ll never get to see his face when I tell him I did it with Nina.
 <br>
 Actually, I&#39;d like to see my face when I do it with Nina.
 <br>
 I bet I look like a stallion.
 <br>
 So today we sit in this circle in honor of Leo.
 <br>
 He was my boss.
 <br>
 He was my friend.
 <br>
 He was my connection.
 <br>
 To Leo.
 <br>
 [All] To Leo! Well, I found out how much cider is too much cider.
 <br>
 A barrel? Shut it! Great news.
 <br>
 Little Timmy Stinson cut his finger off in a whittling event.
 <br>
 They&#39;re out.
 <br>
 We&#39;re in second place.
 <br>
 And if we win this next event, we&#39;ll be champions.
 <br>
 And maybe even friends.
 <br>
 Look, we&#39;ve had a rough day and we&#39;ve both said some things that we didn&#39;t mean.
 <br>
 But we&#39;ve got to pull it together for this final event.
 <br>
 Just tell me where you go Friday nights.
 <br>
 I rent a motel room and I lock the door and I cry, okay? I cry like a damn baby.
 <br>
 Why do you need butt-less chaps for that? Okay, it&#39;s time for our final event.
 <br>
 &#34;Transport your gold in a genuine covered wagon to Pioneer Pete&#39;s&#34;- You know what? I&#39;m tired.
 <br>
 Pull the wagons.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 ## [Man Singing Country] ## [Ends] - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Grunts] - [Panting] Ooh! - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 - Who&#39;s bad? - We bad.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 - We bad! - We bad! We bad! Okay, it&#39;s time for Pioneer Pete to claim his gold! I saw that, Donna.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I know you think I&#39;m a disappointment and stuff.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 I&#39;m proud of how we did.
 <br>
 Look, I know what it&#39;s like to have your dad riding you all the time.
 <br>
 My old man was always on me to go to engineering school.
 <br>
 And when I didn&#39;t, he was so mad we didn&#39;t talk for a year.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re the softy in your family? See, my dad&#39;s vision for my life was wrong.
 <br>
 Only I knew what was best.
 <br>
 Not my dad.
 <br>
 You understand what I&#39;m saying? Wow.
 <br>
 Are-Are you admitting that you&#39;re wrong that it&#39;s okay for me and Donna to get married? What? No, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;m saying that my dad was wrong and I was right.
 <br>
 Just like I&#39;m right now.
 <br>
 The point is, I&#39;m always right, so break it off! Well, at least you&#39;re still happy for us.
 <br>
 Please, Donna, I&#39;m standing right here.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no need to yell! You know what? I don&#39;t care what my dad says.
 <br>
 I am more committed to this marriage than ever.
 <br>
 Well, after seeing how you handled that cow, so am I.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So you raise the ax, and you bring it straight down.
 <br>
 - Okay? Raise.
 <br>
 Bring down.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s easy.
 <br>
 Now, it&#39;s all about leverage.
 <br>
 You know, torque.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what either of those is but I&#39;ll give it a shot.
 <br>
 [Cow Lowing] - Let&#39;s get outta here.
 <br>
 - Right behind you.
 <br>
