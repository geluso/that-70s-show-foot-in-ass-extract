<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hi, honey.
 <br>
 Welcome home from work.
 <br>
 Oh, god, I love saying that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s much better than saying, welcome home from loitering at the head shop.
 <br>
 Oh, my god, hyde.
 <br>
 Five seconds have gone by, and you haven&#39;t ripped off your tie, or as you refer to it, &#34;the yoke of oppression.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah, forgot I was wearin&#39; it.
 <br>
 Would you look at that? The dancing bear has become accustomed to his cage.
 <br>
 Why would you put a dancing bear in a cage? He&#39;s entertaining you, give him some room.
 <br>
 No, fez, what she&#39;s saying is that hyde is becoming a money-grubbing corporate zombie.
 <br>
 Did you hear that, steven? We&#39;re gonna be rich! No, we&#39;re not, jackie.
 <br>
 I hate the man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still dedicated to kicking his ass.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just doing it from the inside, where I get a pension and dental and stuff.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t worry, honey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still a rebel.
 <br>
 Give me two years, I&#39;ll have him speaking french and writing thank-you notes.
 <br>
 hyde&#39;s growin&#39; up so fast.
 <br>
 It seems like just yesterday, we were swipin&#39; &#34;playboys,&#34; trenchin&#39;old man shinsky&#39;s yard and cuttin&#39; the brakes on fat marvin&#39;s bike.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t remember trenching old man shinsky&#39;s yard.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s &#39;cause you didn&#39;t approve.
 <br>
 I think your exact words were, &#34;that guy&#39;s worked hard on his yard.
 <br>
 &#34; What&#39;s wrong with me? Yeah, I don&#39;t want to wake up in 20 years and realize that I haven&#39;t harassed enough grouchy old men.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t want to wake up in 20 years and realize this was all a dream.
 <br>
 Wouldn&#39;t that be weird, if none of this was real? Okay, now I&#39;m starting to freak out a little.
 <br>
 You know what? I want to trench a yard.
 <br>
 Just not if it&#39;s one of those pranks that involves heights or touching bugs.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not--I-I I won&#39;t touch a bug.
 <br>
 No, you just park your car on someone&#39;s yard, and then you step on the gas, throw it in drive, and tear up the lawn.
 <br>
 Then you go get fries and talk about how awesome it was.
 <br>
 You know what, you guys? I&#39;m gonna trench old man shinsky&#39;s yard.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m gonna trench that yard like no yard has been trenched in the history of yard trenching.
 <br>
 Are you with me? - Whatever.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I said, are you with me?! - Whatever.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 yeah! That&#39;s what I like to hear.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s show - Saison 7 Episode 06 &#34;Rip this joint&#34; What are those for? oh, no.
 <br>
 What did you do? Why did you have to wear something so revealing? It&#39;s just a friendly party, for pete&#39;s sake.
 <br>
 This party&#39;s not for pete.
 <br>
 It&#39;s for kitty, dummy.
 <br>
 They&#39;ve been arguing all the time lately.
 <br>
 Last night they did two hours on &#34;I know you are, but what am I&#34;? Did someone say party? There&#39;s no party.
 <br>
 Right, kitty? Yes, there is a party, red.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you wonder why I bought all that liquor? Honestly, no.
 <br>
 Hey, thanks for inviting us to your party, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t stay, though, &#39;cause eric&#39;s gonna trench a coat.
 <br>
 A trench coat.
 <br>
 Kitty, how could you have a party without telling me? Maybe it&#39;s because every time she tells you, you go through five stages anger, fury, rage, super rage, and, finally, cursing god for bringing you into this world.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been there.
 <br>
 Why did you do it?! So what&#39;s the occasion, kitty? According to &#34;cosmo&#34;&#39;s latest quiz, I have medium to lowself-esteem.
 <br>
 So the article suggested that I should throw a party in celebration of me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done that.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done that.
 <br>
 - You&#39;ve have, too? - Isn&#39;t it fun? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 okay, guys, I&#39;ve been thinking about this trenching thing, and it&#39;s a little boring.
 <br>
 But I think I&#39;ve figured out a way to forman-ize it.
 <br>
 You mean, make it more boring? No, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m going to get out of the car, moon old man shinsky and then trench the yard.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve all now been witness to the invention of the &#34;moon &#39;n&#39; trench.
 <br>
 &#34; I don&#39;t know, eric.
 <br>
 It seems risky.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re not fast, you&#39;re uncoordinated, and you&#39;re easily tripped.
 <br>
 I mean, if you get out of the car, you&#39;re a dead man.
 <br>
 Not with me backin&#39; him up as his first lieutenant.
 <br>
 Oh, um, actually, you&#39;re not my first lieutenant.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s my first lieutenant.
 <br>
 I went from fianc√©e to first lieutenant? What a year.
 <br>
 How could you pick a girl over me? Kelso, remember when we put eggs in sister mary catherine&#39;s mail slot, and you were the getaway driver? And when we needed to get away, you had left to get ice cream? I was the getaway driver, and I got away.
 <br>
 Man, you&#39;ve got forman, kelso, an old man and a naked butt.
 <br>
 This could go the kind of wrong people write books about.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m not goin&#39;.
 <br>
 Oh,  that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 See, steven decided he&#39;d rather hang out with his father at kitty&#39;s grown-up cocktail party.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hyde.
 <br>
 I&#39;m goin&#39; to a cocktail party.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hyde.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to a party with cocktails.
 <br>
 what the hell are you guys doing? I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Kitty, who are all these people? Well, they&#39;re my friends.
 <br>
 I never introduced you because I know you don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Hey,  W.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 , Come on in.
 <br>
 Hey, steven.
 <br>
 I thought I had the wrong night.
 <br>
 You white folks throw a really quiet party.
 <br>
 Yeah, wait till they bring out the onion dip.
 <br>
 All hell breaks loose.
 <br>
 I want you guys to meet my dad.
 <br>
 This is william barnett.
 <br>
 He owns a chain of record stores.
 <br>
 He&#39;s rich.
 <br>
 Jackie, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say-- ah, what the hell, yeah, I am.
 <br>
 And, W.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 , This is bob, who&#39;s also done some work in retail, and midge, who&#39;s also been to some stores.
 <br>
 It&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Steven, you didn&#39;t tell me your father was so handsome.
 <br>
 Hey, what about me? Well, you didn&#39;t tell me either.
 <br>
 Okay, hello.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s kick off kitty fest with a little game.
 <br>
 How about hide-and-go-to-sleep? When I blow this whistle pair up with someone and tell an anecdote about me.
 <br>
 When I blow it again pair up with someone else, and the person who tells the cutest story will get a special mention in my christmas newsletter.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a prize? Now since there are an odd number of people here, I&#39;m afraid one unlucky person is going to get left out of the fun.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll fall on that grenade.
 <br>
 Good night, everybody.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, let&#39;s see if I have everything I need for the moon &#39;n&#39; trench.
 <br>
 Car, check.
 <br>
 Lawn, check.
 <br>
 Creamy white butt,check.
 <br>
 eric, wait.
 <br>
 If you moon old man shinsky, you&#39;re not gonna have time to pull up your pants.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t run back to the car with them around your ankles.
 <br>
 - You think I shouldn&#39;t do it? - No, hell, no.
 <br>
 I think you should do it pantsless.
 <br>
 Eric, he&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I mean, you can barely run with your pants on.
 <br>
 The pants come off.
 <br>
 Oh, great.
 <br>
 Everybody&#39;s on board when eric wants to take his pants off, but when I do it, we have to leave the restaurant.
 <br>
 It&#39;s go time.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on here? That&#39;s my butt! Whoo! Lock, donna.
 <br>
 Now for the trench.
 <br>
 what-- what&#39;s goin&#39; on? We&#39;re not movin&#39;.
 <br>
 Oh, man, you dropped your transmission.
 <br>
 In english, donna,in english.
 <br>
 Your car no go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m calling the police! Wait, I am the police.
 <br>
 They can&#39;t catch me here.
 <br>
 We gotta go.
 <br>
 I gotta stay with the car.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 Donna, what are we gonna do? I love you, eric.
 <br>
 No, don&#39;t leave me.
 <br>
 Oh, kelso.
 <br>
 Buddy, thanks.
 <br>
 I knew you&#39;d come back.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m not really back.
 <br>
 Since you didn&#39;t make me first lieutenant, I&#39;m just here to say, I got his pants! you are right, phyllis, I am a talented mimic.
 <br>
 &#34;hi, I&#39;m johnny carson, and I&#39;m on tv.
 <br>
 &#34; Uh-oh, time to switch.
 <br>
 well, it&#39;s you and me.
 <br>
 This should be fun.
 <br>
 So, hum you take out the trash.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I gotta do that, then.
 <br>
 Oh, this is terrible.
 <br>
 Have we run out of things to talk about? Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 Let me see I saw a squirrel in the yard today.
 <br>
 I love that squirrel.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been feeding him peanuts Well, that explains why he took the poison right out of my hand.
 <br>
 Jackie, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with me.
 <br>
 I just got paired up with this book keeping guy who told me a story about accounts receivable.
 <br>
 Not only did I know what he was talking about, I suggested he make a flowchart.
 <br>
 Oh, my god, you are so sexy right now.
 <br>
 Say &#34;flowchart&#34; again.
 <br>
 Kitty, kitty, that was the third whistle, and midge and W.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 Still haven&#39;t switched.
 <br>
 Look at her laughing at him.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not even funny.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t once heard him say,&#34;knock knock.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay, wait, I have a good one.
 <br>
 &#34;Knock knock.
 <br>
 &#34; Damn it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna stand for you throwing yourself at every guy you meet.
 <br>
 Midge, We&#39;re goin&#39; home.
 <br>
 Until you&#39;re ready to trust me, I&#39;m not goin&#39; anywhere.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m leaving.
 <br>
 Where are you going? To  lock myself in your bathroom.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong with your bathroom? I can&#39;t go there.
 <br>
 There&#39;s too many painful memories of sexy showers with bob.
 <br>
 See, I told you people do that.
 <br>
 look, man, please don&#39;t call my dad.
 <br>
 If he hears about this, he&#39;s gonna kill me.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t mean figuratively.
 <br>
 He will literally kill mewith his bare hands.
 <br>
 He will kill me like he has killed oh-so-many squirrels.
 <br>
 Settle down.
 <br>
 You&#39;re 18.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna call your dad.
 <br>
 I want my daddy.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 - They said I could visit you for ten minutes.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s good to see a friendly face.
 <br>
 Jail&#39;s no place for me, Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;m too pretty.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re gonna be fine.
 <br>
 Plus, I brought something that you really need.
 <br>
 - Tell me it&#39;s pants.
 <br>
 - Ooh, Crap.
 <br>
 I knew I forgot something.
 <br>
 But how do &#34;milk duds&#34; sound? Kinda like they won&#39;t cover the lower half of my body.
 <br>
 All right, visiting hours are over.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 He&#39;s cranky anyway.
 <br>
 All right, kelso, awesome, get me out of here.
 <br>
 Shut up, punk.
 <br>
 You know, around here we have a saying.
 <br>
 Is it, &#34;everyone down.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s got a gun&#34;? No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s &#34;kelso gets to be first lieutenant.
 <br>
 &#34; But now, sir, you are a criminal, and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of my imagination.
 <br>
 Midge? Please come out so you can talk to bob.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t do that, kitty.
 <br>
 You mean you don&#39;t know how? The lock is on the doorknob.
 <br>
 No, I mean I&#39;m not coming out, but thank you, I see it now.
 <br>
 - I want to go to sleep.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 Well, I wanted one night that was just about me, and now everything&#39;s about midge.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not enough that she&#39;s got legs up to here, and the you-know-what&#39;s out to you-know-where.
 <br>
 Now she&#39;s gotta upstage me on my big night.
 <br>
 Well, you just get over yourself, lady.
 <br>
 You know, I never thought I&#39;d be saying this.
 <br>
 But how&#39;s about you and me get a motel room? I&#39;d like that.
 <br>
 okay, I&#39;m starting to shake off this whole flowchart thing.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t remember what a flowchart is.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t even remember what I just said.
 <br>
 Hey, which one of you jerks put this tie on me? Steven, focus.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a businessman.
 <br>
 You love work and money and me.
 <br>
 Hold on to that.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what? You&#39;re gonna forget.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll write it down.
 <br>
 Oh, you guys missed a glorious trenching.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s tiny butt gleaming in the moonlight, shining brighter than the brightest star.
 <br>
 It was like a Disney movie.
 <br>
 Yeah, eric&#39;s rear end is white.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even tell if he&#39;s wearing underwear.
 <br>
 Tonight, in that jail cell, he&#39;s gonna glow like a little lightning bug.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s in jail, and I spent my entire night at a cocktail party? I gotta go break some laws or I&#39;m never gonna forgive myself.
 <br>
 Hey, which one of you jerks put this tie on me? I know what you&#39;re thinkin&#39;, punk.
 <br>
 Is that gun real or fake? Well, the gun is green.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s also plastic, so it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess.
 <br>
 Well then you have to ask yourself one question, punk-- do I like being squirted with grape juice? - Well, do you? Yeah? - Okay, quit it.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re gonna be all sticky.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Okay, Mr.
 <br>
 Shinsky, Once you&#39;ve identified the culprit, you can file a formal complaint.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s him.
 <br>
 I&#39;d recognize that creamy-assed moron anywhere.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, he was there, too.
 <br>
 What, me? No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 I was undercover, infiltrating the underworld trenching world.
 <br>
 And it goes a lot deeper than you might think.
 <br>
 The whole middle school might be involved.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 In you go, kelso.
 <br>
 Aw, no, you&#39;re putting me in jail? Maybe a few hours in the can will give you a new respect for the law.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s the thing, it won&#39;t.
 <br>
 I hope midge isn&#39;t going through my medicine cabinet.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got some pills in there, and they are not for amateurs.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on? Your loony mother has locked herself in my bathroom.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll  handle this.
 <br>
 Mom, the lock is on the doorknob.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it, midge.
 <br>
 Come out now or I&#39;m kickin&#39; down the door.
 <br>
 If you kick down that door, you&#39;re gonna have to put it back up.
 <br>
 You take the fun out of everything, red.
 <br>
 Mom, if you won&#39;t come out, will you at least let dad come in there? how could you think I was flirting with another man? maybe I overreacted.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a beautiful woman.
 <br>
 So are you, bob.
 <br>
 What the hell are they doing in there? All right, I&#39;m sorry about tonight.
 <br>
 You just really hurt my feelings when you didn&#39;t make me first lieutenant on the shinsky job.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, too.
 <br>
 I guess I never realized how seriously you take imaginary ranks assigned by your friends.
 <br>
 Well, now you know.
 <br>
 Well, after a long night of hashing things out, we all decided that my parents are better off apart, so we took my mom to the airport this morning.
 <br>
 She headed back to california? I hope so.
 <br>
 I taped the ticket to her purse.
 <br>
 You&#39;re coming home in your underwear again? I&#39;m gonna paint some damn pants on you.
 <br>
 Okay, but in my defense, this time I took off my pants by choice.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know where we went wrong with you.
 <br>
 We take you to church, we try to raise you to be a decent human being, and yet you turn out to be a bottomless deviant.
 <br>
 Okay, red, the shower&#39;s running.
 <br>
 You promised.
 <br>
 Stick my eggs in the oven.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be back in five minutes.
 <br>
 Freeze, punk, freeze! Hi.
 <br>
 What are you in for? Let&#39;s just say old man shinsky&#39;s yard has been professionally trenched.
 <br>
 Did the rose bushes, too.
 <br>
 It&#39;s sort of my calling card.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 This feels good.
 <br>
 This feels right.
 <br>
 <br>
