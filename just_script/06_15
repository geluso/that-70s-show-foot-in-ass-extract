<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Oh, hey, Donna, about this little celibacy kick we&#39;re on, does that cover quickies, &#39;cause I could be really quick? Well, that&#39;s why I call you &#34;the flash.
 <br>
 &#34; That&#39;s why you call me the flash? I thought it was &#39;cause I was flashy, like an entertainer.
 <br>
 Come on, one little one.
 <br>
 You can even watch tv.
 <br>
 Eric, we agreed to hold off until the wedding.
 <br>
 It&#39;s cleansing.
 <br>
 No, Donna, giving up cigarettes is cleansing.
 <br>
 Giving up sex is reckless and irresponsible, and I think it might cause cancer.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie, I know since you moved in, we agreed to give each other messages as soon as possible, and in the spirit of that, your mom called last Tuesday.
 <br>
 What? No, she couldn&#39;t call.
 <br>
 She&#39;s in mexico.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t have phones there.
 <br>
 Uh, yeah, they do.
 <br>
 Why would we give them phones? My dad tried to get back in touch with me once.
 <br>
 Instead of calling, he just left a six-pack on my car.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you know it was him? He was passed out on the hood.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t have anything to say to my mom.
 <br>
 She ditched me three months ago, and that&#39;s all I need to know.
 <br>
 Oh, man, that&#39;s really sad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like a mother and daughter divided.
 <br>
 So, hey, what about some second base action? What did I tell you about talking about the bases, flash? Donna.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t know why.
 <br>
 Jackie, you should cut your mom a break.
 <br>
 I think she&#39;s charming.
 <br>
 If she calls again, just tell her I don&#39;t want to see her.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s too bad &#39;cause I just picked her up from the airport.
 <br>
 And here I am.
 <br>
 Mom! Oh, I love making an entrance.
 <br>
 Be a dear and go watch my luggage.
 <br>
 Really? Thanks.
 <br>
 What are you doing here? Who cares? Welcome to my driveway, pretty lady.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Eric Forman.
 <br>
 Remember me? Big fan.
 <br>
 Oh, right, my toy poodle snowball almost killed you when you were 6.
 <br>
 I was 13, but, yeah.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Burkhart, Steven Hyde.
 <br>
 Nice to see you again.
 <br>
 Just thought I&#39;d let you know that Jackie and I are kind of dating now.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you rob our house? Well, I was in there a few times at night, but I never took anything.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Burkhart! I thought I saw gorgeous, flowing hair on bronze shoulders, And I wasn&#39;t near a mirror, so I knew it had to be you.
 <br>
 Mom, why are you back? It got rainy in Cabo, so I hopped on a plane.
 <br>
 Wish I was a plane.
 <br>
 Then she could hop on me.
 <br>
 And by hop on me, I mean Yeah, yeah, we got it, Fez.
 <br>
 Wait, let me guess.
 <br>
 &#34;rainy in Cabo&#34; is Spanish for &#34;my rich pilot boyfriend ran out of money.
 <br>
 &#34; Don&#39;t be silly.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know any Spanish, Except for gracias amas tequila.
 <br>
 I just missed you.
 <br>
 Well, I didn&#39;t miss you.
 <br>
 And there&#39;s the stomp and cry.
 <br>
 See you guys tomorrow.
 <br>
 Miss Burkhart, I know you and Jackie are working through some difficult stuff, but may I just say, nice tan? Yeah, it really makes everything pop.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m popping a little right now.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t we ever have tea? Well, this sounds like the beginning of a wonderful argument Like the stuffing versus mashed potatoes fight that turned into why don&#39;t I ever take you on vacation.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you ever take me on vacation? Oh, crap.
 <br>
 Oh, Mr.
 <br>
 And Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 Not this again.
 <br>
 Kitty, make it stop.
 <br>
 Now be nice, Red.
 <br>
 Her mom finally came home from her cultural tour of Mexico&#39;s many fine bars and cantinas.
 <br>
 Why did she have to go all the way to Mexico to drink all day? Why couldn&#39;t she be a good mom and just do it at home like you do? Well, that&#39;s a good question.
 <br>
 And you need to sit down and talk to her about it.
 <br>
 You can do it here with tea.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll have tea! No! Why does this always happen here? We&#39;re in a recession.
 <br>
 There are vacant lots all over the place.
 <br>
 Well, you can go stand in a vacant lot.
 <br>
 We&#39;re having a tea party with crumpets.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll find out what they are, and we will have them.
 <br>
 Okay, but I don&#39;t know if I can look my mom in the eye.
 <br>
 I mean, I never thought I&#39;d say this, but there comes a point when a person is too tan.
 <br>
 Whoa, check out this new police academy they&#39;re sending me to in waukegan.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got its own pool! Oh, man, if I&#39;d have known it was gonna be this nice, I&#39;d have burned down the old one a lot sooner.
 <br>
 Kelso, I&#39;m really going to miss you.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s gonna take my lunch money and tease me and pull down my pants in front of girls? I&#39;ll be taking over.
 <br>
 Hey, you&#39;re still gonna drive me up there, right? Oh, man, Jackie&#39;s got this heavy thing with her mom.
 <br>
 I know she&#39;s gonna wanna talk about it a lot.
 <br>
 So, yeah, I&#39;ll drive you.
 <br>
 Hey, since Donna cut me off, I took the money that I would have spent on a romantic dinner for two and bought me a gross of bottle rockets.
 <br>
 Take that, Pinciotti! Bottle rockets, all right.
 <br>
 Fez, start running.
 <br>
 No, wait.
 <br>
 I got a better idea.
 <br>
 After we drop him off, let&#39;s stop off at the dairy farm, scare the hell out of some cows.
 <br>
 Ooh, I love cows.
 <br>
 They&#39;re the one animal I can run faster than.
 <br>
 No, no, let&#39;s go before you drop me off.
 <br>
 That big spotted one needs an attitude adjustment.
 <br>
 No, man, it&#39;s got to be at night.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ve launched so much stuff at those cows during the day, I swear, they recognize my car.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you guys are going without me.
 <br>
 Those cows will never know what hit them.
 <br>
 And even after it hits them, they still won&#39;t know, because they&#39;re cows.
 <br>
 Okay, here, Red, try this tea.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll make you feel british.
 <br>
 mum&#39;s the word, governor.
 <br>
 Kitty, this is America.
 <br>
 We bomb countries that drink tea.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s because coffee keeps us awake all night, and we wake up in such a bad mood, we have to bomb someone.
 <br>
 Ooh, ooh, I bet that&#39;s Jackie&#39;s mom.
 <br>
 I still don&#39;t think we should get involved in this.
 <br>
 As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is between Jackie and her ditzy lush of a mom.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 You must be Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Pam Burkhart.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Pam.
 <br>
 You made tea.
 <br>
 Oh, I love tea.
 <br>
 So do I.
 <br>
 Wipe your chin, honey.
 <br>
 You got some drool.
 <br>
 Thank you both so much for doing this.
 <br>
 You know, when you are as beautiful as I am, it&#39;s hard to know who your real friends are.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m sorry that you have to go through that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just hoping that Jackie and I figure out a way to get along.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;ve got your low-cut, getting-along sweater on, so I bet that&#39;ll help.
 <br>
 Hi, honey.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 And by &#34;hi,&#34; I mean, not hi, because I&#39;m not talking to you, even though I&#39;m talking now.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m just gonna stop talking, starting now.
 <br>
 Oh! Dang it.
 <br>
 Starting now.
 <br>
 And now.
 <br>
 This is awkward.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t I tell a story about something charming I did in Mexico? I&#39;d love to hear it.
 <br>
 There was this woman on a beach in cozumel.
 <br>
 and normally, I wouldn&#39;t talk to someone who had such bad skin, but she was selling the cutest hair clips, so here.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;d tell you that doesn&#39;t fix anything, but I&#39;m not talking to you.
 <br>
 Oh, shoot! Starting now! Yeah, nice try, Mrs.
 <br>
 Burkhart.
 <br>
 Damn, these are cute.
 <br>
 Look, Jackie, when your father got into trouble, I panicked, but that doesn&#39;t mean I stopped caring about you.
 <br>
 Jackie, if you seriously don&#39;t want these, can I have them? Look, mom, a good time to tell me you cared about me was the day daddy went to prison, not two months later on a postcard from la Cantina Cucaracha in Guadalajara.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t it nice to get postcards? Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Jackie, look, I know that you&#39;ve got hostile feelings towards me, but I&#39;m your mother, and I love you.
 <br>
 And I promise I&#39;ll never leave you again.
 <br>
 I believe her.
 <br>
 Me, too.
 <br>
 Kelso, you leave for the police academy tomorrow.
 <br>
 Shouldn&#39;t you be packing gasoline and matches so you can burn that one down, too? I don&#39;t need gasoline to burn stuff down.
 <br>
 All I need is these two hands and a lack of adult supervision.
 <br>
 Anyway, I&#39;m not going.
 <br>
 I decided I didn&#39;t want to be a cop.
 <br>
 But, Kelso, I thought you wanted to impress the mother of your child and give your life a purpose and pull over girls for speeding while foxy.
 <br>
 No, I got my reasons.
 <br>
 I mean, I don&#39;t want to leave when things are going so good for me and Brooke.
 <br>
 Plus, blue isn&#39;t a very good color for me.
 <br>
 What, are you crazy? You take blue to a whole new level.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s go blast some cows.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 All you talk about is being a cop.
 <br>
 You haven&#39;t focused on anything this hard since you thought you heard your name on &#34;Led Zeppelin II.
 <br>
 &#34; It&#39;s in there.
 <br>
 In &#34;Whole lotta love,&#34; he clearly sings, &#34; Kelso lotta love.
 <br>
 &#34; Kelso, I&#39;m gonna make sure you become a cop.
 <br>
 Yeah, we&#39;re not gonna let you throw your life away.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care about that.
 <br>
 Look, I got a few things pending downtown, and I need someone on the inside.
 <br>
 Jackie, just go see your mom.
 <br>
 She chose you over golden sunsets, frozen margaritas.
 <br>
 Man, why aren&#39;t we down there? Donna, you don&#39;t get her, because you&#39;ll never understand the intoxicating quality of getting anything you want with your looks.
 <br>
 Look, she&#39;s just here till she finds a new meal ticket.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t believe that for a minute.
 <br>
 I think she came back to be with you, not to find some lonely rich guy.
 <br>
 Your mother is a lovely woman.
 <br>
 Donna, Pam and I are gonna catch a movie.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my first American date in months.
 <br>
 Your mother is a gold-digging tramp.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe my mom is going out with your Bob of a dad.
 <br>
 Oh, what? He&#39;s not good enough? Oh, so you see it, too? I expected her to go after a cool rich guy, like Jack Nicholson or a Bee Gee.
 <br>
 You&#39;re dad is cheesy and corny, like nachos.
 <br>
 Well, then no wonder your mom is after him.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll touch anything from Mexico! Oh, hey, you take that back right now, or I will pull your hair really hard! Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Eric, not now.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m sorry, Donna, but you cut me off, and I always thought it was lame when Kelso said that girl fights were sexy, but now I can see he was very right! So you, hair pull, you, shirt rip.
 <br>
 You&#39;d better go talk to your mom.
 <br>
 You&#39;d better go talk to your dad.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 I overplayed my hand there a little bit.
 <br>
 * Hey, come on, buddy.
 <br>
 Time to go to cop school.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 King-size pillows on a twin-size bed.
 <br>
 Why didn&#39;t I think of that? Man, he just split on us.
 <br>
 Ow! yeah, he&#39;s definitely gone.
 <br>
 I guess we&#39;ll just leave then.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s not fair.
 <br>
 You guys made leaving sounds.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, kitty.
 <br>
 Enough with the silent treatment.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t say that I liked tea because Pam is pretty.
 <br>
 I said that I liked tea because you were kind enough and courageous enough to open my eyes to a whole new world of hot beverages, which is just one of the millions of things that you have done to improve my life over all these years.
 <br>
 So now I&#39;m old.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, will you please talk some sense into my dad? Last night he went on a date with Jackie&#39;s mom.
 <br>
 Oh, you hear that, Red? Looks like your girlfriend&#39;s stepn&#39; out.
 <br>
 Donna, Pam&#39;s just what I&#39;ve been looking for.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve loved pretty women, and I&#39;ve loved smart women.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m going back to pretty.
 <br>
 Dad, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little suspicious that she just got back and she&#39;s already latched on to you? I&#39;m a very cute man, donna.
 <br>
 Bob, this is clearly upsetting Donna.
 <br>
 How can u date her? Yeah, how can you date her? What does that mean? What? You emphasized &#34;her,&#34; like there&#39;s something special about her.
 <br>
 I just said what you said, but you must have missed it because I was on my way outside to mow the lawn.
 <br>
 Oh, man, I can&#39;t believe Donna is serious about this celibacy thing.
 <br>
 Fez, how do you cope with not getting any? I think you know how I cope.
 <br>
 When you don&#39;t see me, I&#39;m coping.
 <br>
 Hey, he tried to get away again.
 <br>
 So I had to use his stun gun on him.
 <br>
 Yeah, it didn&#39;t hurt, though.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done it to myself so many times, I baly feel it anymore.
 <br>
 Just get in the car.
 <br>
 You guys can take me to the academy, but as soon as you leave, I&#39;m gone.
 <br>
 All right, Kelso, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t had sex in weeks.
 <br>
 Fez is a drought not seen since the great dust bow, we are tightly wound.
 <br>
 So you&#39;d better tell us what your real problem is, or we&#39;re gonna freakin&#39; throttle you.
 <br>
 I will tear you apart like a lion.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I don&#39;t want to tell you guys, because I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re gonna make fun of me.
 <br>
 Oh, Kelso, of course we&#39;re gonna make fun of you.
 <br>
 All right, fine.
 <br>
 You know what? It&#39;s like I&#39;m going to a new school, okay? And I&#39;m worried that I&#39;m not gonna be able to make friends.
 <br>
 First off, I&#39;m so much better looking than everyone else.
 <br>
 The only reason you guys are friends with me is &#39;cause you met me before I blossomed.
 <br>
 Man, you should be worried about something that could actually happen, like handcuffing yourself to a horse.
 <br>
 Look, Kelso, here&#39;s the thing You&#39;ve stolen my stuff, and you&#39;ve burned my stuff, you&#39;ve even groped my stuff.
 <br>
 But I still hang out with you because you are a great guy.
 <br>
 Come on, you&#39;re Michael Kelso, right? You&#39;re bulletproof.
 <br>
 Damn it, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I am bulletproof.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s get going.
 <br>
 All right! Hey, by the way, you&#39;re not actually bulletproof.
 <br>
 Where do you think you&#39;re going? To the backyard.
 <br>
 Unh-unh, I&#39;m going to the backyard.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t give me that dirty look and say, &#34;whatever.
 <br>
 &#34; That is my thing! Oh, my God! Hot tub! Mom, what are you doing in there with that wet, hairy man? And why are you wearing a white swimsuit? It&#39;s winter! Bobby and I are just having a soak.
 <br>
 Bobby? When did we get a hot tub, Bobby? Me and Pammy were out shopping, and I saw it, so I bought it.
 <br>
 Even got the good one with the euphoria jet.
 <br>
 I love it in here.
 <br>
 You know, if you put salt around the rim, it&#39;d be like being in a giant margarita.
 <br>
 Hey, what the hell, right? I have all this extra money, and Pammy here helped me spend some.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s her specialty.
 <br>
 Oh, you shut up about my mom.
 <br>
 Thank you, Jackie.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t defending you, ok? This is just really weird.
 <br>
 Oh, can you both at least put your hands up where I can see them? Enough, all right? I like Pam, and she likes me.
 <br>
 We&#39;re both adults.
 <br>
 So if you two can&#39;t handle it, that&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 Now go inside.
 <br>
 You&#39;re ruining our soak.
 <br>
 This soak is over.
 <br>
 Then we&#39;ll go inside.
 <br>
 Dad, are you naked? How else am I gonna try the euphoria jet? Okay, I know we both have different reasons for wanting our parents to stop seeing each other, like I hate your mom, and your mom&#39;s a tramp.
 <br>
 But we have to join forces and do everything we can to break them up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m with you, Donna.
 <br>
 All the couples I&#39;ve broken up before were just training till now.
 <br>
 This one&#39;s not for popularity or to make another girl cry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s for my beautiful mom and your mayonnaise-lovin&#39; dad.
 <br>
 Ooh, how&#39;s it going, girls? Not good.
 <br>
 We just saw Bob and Pam in a hot tub.
 <br>
 Bob and Pam are in a hot tub? Pam&#39;s in a hot tub? There.
 <br>
 You did it again.
 <br>
 And this time, you didn&#39;t even say &#34;Bob.
 <br>
 &#34; Yes, I did.
 <br>
 No, you didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yes, I did.
 <br>
 And you would have heard it, too, if it hadn&#39;t been for all that damn tea.
 <br>
 You know, I fought a war to keep that crap out of this country, and you had to bring it into my house.
 <br>
 And you call yourself an American, huh? ok.
 <br>
 I&#39;m all set.
 <br>
 So here I go.
 <br>
 Kelso, you&#39;re gonna do great.
 <br>
 But, hey, just in case, I packed some extra cookies in your lunch to help you make friends.
 <br>
 Oh, um, I ate the cookies try to find a friend who likes carrots.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Well Guess this is it.
 <br>
 Hey, give those cows hell, boys.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, I love you! Shut up! I love you, too, Kelso! You guys, quit it! I love you the most! We were just kidding.
 <br>
 So was I.
 <br>
 S-so was I.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe there were no cows, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, what are we gonna do with all these bottle rockets? Fine, I&#39;ll be the cow.
 <br>
 But this time, count all the way to ten.
 <br>
 You got it, buddy.
 <br>
 One.
 <br>
 Ten.
 <br>
