<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Guys, can we do something besides cruise? That&#39;s the third time tonight we&#39;ve driven by that house.
 <br>
 You know what we could do.
 <br>
 We could go skinny dipping.
 <br>
 Naked! That&#39;s the way God intended.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 - Why not? It&#39;d be fun.
 <br>
 - Sure, it&#39;s fun for you guys &#39;cause you get to look at us and that&#39;s a treat.
 <br>
 But we just get to look at you.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s nasty.
 <br>
 So, you don&#39;t want to do it? - I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 - You Okay, I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Naked is dirty.
 <br>
 Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty Dirty, dirty, dirty This was such a good idea, Michael.
 <br>
 This was so much fun.
 <br>
 Wait, except for the part where our clothes got stolen, you idiot.
 <br>
 By the way, Fez, nice tattoo, man.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the Blessed Virgin of Yorba Linda.
 <br>
 - Do you want to see her dance? - No! Look, guys, we need a plan.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not driving up to the house with a car full of naked people.
 <br>
 Red hates you guys when you&#39;re dressed.
 <br>
 We can go to my house.
 <br>
 Yeah, your mom&#39;s used to having naked guys around.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not even home, you moron.
 <br>
 Put on the top 40.
 <br>
 Sit down, Fez! I see London, I see Besticle.
 <br>
 What do you want me to do about it? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Tuck it in.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Pork chops? I thought we agreed to stick to a budget.
 <br>
 Pork chops aren&#39;t cheap.
 <br>
 You know, on the way to the market I tried to run over a cat.
 <br>
 But they are just so darn speedy.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 The plant&#39;s gonna be closing soon.
 <br>
 I mean, we have to watch our money.
 <br>
 Maybe I could put you on the sugar diet.
 <br>
 - That&#39;d save money.
 <br>
 - Sugar diet? Sweet? See, that&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 Give me another spoonful.
 <br>
 Tasty and cheap.
 <br>
 Now, when I say cheap I mean, you know, not Shut up.
 <br>
 So, this is your home.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 This explains a lot of your behavior.
 <br>
 Come on, man, this place is great.
 <br>
 It&#39;s better than Forman&#39;s basement.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a color TV, I just got new vice grips so now we can watch any channel we want.
 <br>
 Hyde, your mom really just ran off with some trucker? No, Forman, I made it up because it sounds so classy.
 <br>
 Why would she just run off with some trucker? It&#39;s springtime.
 <br>
 Love is in the air, man.
 <br>
 Right, and she just left you here alone? Look, I realize this is hard for you to get your head around, Opie but you&#39;re failing to see the upside here.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve got food, we&#39;ve got beer, we have zero adult supervision.
 <br>
 Welcome to Camp Naughty-Bad-Fun.
 <br>
 Jackie, you couldn&#39;t find anything? Okay, no offense, Hyde, but all your mother&#39;s clothes are whorey.
 <br>
 What? But they look great on you, Donna.
 <br>
 Thanks, Jackie.
 <br>
 Michael, can you please take me home? Look, I think I caught something at the reservoir.
 <br>
 Like an eel? Not that, you idiot.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m sick.
 <br>
 I caught an eel.
 <br>
 But, Midge why do you have to have your Woman Warrior meetings here every week? Because none of the other feminists&#39; husbands will let them.
 <br>
 Boy, those bastards.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Bob, these meetings have really opened my eyes.
 <br>
 For example, the English language is so oppressive to women.
 <br>
 I mean, why is it &#34;mailman&#34; and not &#34;mailwoman&#34;? Why do they even call the mail &#34;mail&#34;? Why not call it &#34;femail&#34;? Yes! You see, Bob, now you&#39;re thinking.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just being funny, because it&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 Okay, then that&#39;s why you&#39;re part of the problem.
 <br>
 My wife is a maniac.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, a womaniac.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t know anyone else was in here.
 <br>
 - You must be Midge&#39;s husband.
 <br>
 - I guess.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a real gung-ho Woman Warrior.
 <br>
 - You must be very proud.
 <br>
 - I guess.
 <br>
 Call me old fashioned but when I see you sitting there eating a sandwich it makes me darn tooting mad.
 <br>
 I mean, I think a married man who provides for his family deserves to come home to a hot meal.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you? You&#39;re neat.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 I thought I told you to wash up for dinner.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s difficult to hear with your head up your ass.
 <br>
 Get a move on.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 You need to relax.
 <br>
 Anger is bad for the soul.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s Fez, right? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Get out! - Okey-dokey.
 <br>
 - Come on.
 <br>
 Wash up.
 <br>
 - Dad can I talk to you for a sec? Do you think that Hyde could stay for dinner? Eric, again? I can&#39;t afford to feed your friends.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even afford to feed you, but the law requires me to.
 <br>
 Look, his mom&#39;s out of town.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 But you have to fill up on bread.
 <br>
 And the two of you are splitting a pork chop.
 <br>
 - Thanks, man.
 <br>
 - No problem.
 <br>
 So, you do know you&#39;re not getting any of that pork chop, right? Is that so? Michael, go away.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sick.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have any makeup on, my hair is a mess, and I look hideous.
 <br>
 Jackie, come on.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care what you look like.
 <br>
 I just want to see you.
 <br>
 Why? Because you&#39;re my girlfriend.
 <br>
 And I got you a present.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Michael, that is so sweet.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the sweetest thing ever.
 <br>
 Let me hold it.
 <br>
 Thank you, lover.
 <br>
 Mom.
 <br>
 Yeah, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you&#39;re not home yet.
 <br>
 Is that right? Okay, great, yeah.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 You know whatever makes you happy.
 <br>
 Hey, Forman.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Come on in, make yourself at home.
 <br>
 I&#39;m out of beer, but if you want, you can break something.
 <br>
 Actually, I had my eye on the phone, so What&#39;s that? It&#39;s crackers with ketchup on top for you know, for zest.
 <br>
 Okay, well I&#39;m just gonna guess that Edna&#39;s not coming back.
 <br>
 No, man, she&#39;s just been delayed a little bit.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t there used to be a TV there? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I pawned it.
 <br>
 You pawned your mom&#39;s TV? Hyde, she&#39;s not coming back.
 <br>
 Okay, she&#39;s not coming back, all right? So what&#39;re you gonna do? Sell the house.
 <br>
 You rent.
 <br>
 I guess I&#39;m in more trouble than I thought.
 <br>
 No, Hyde.
 <br>
 No, Hyde, I&#39;m serious here.
 <br>
 - You need help, my friend.
 <br>
 - No, Forman, you would need help.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 I brought you this sandwich.
 <br>
 Fine, I&#39;ll take your sandwich.
 <br>
 After this, no more help.
 <br>
 Hyde&#39;s mom is gone and he is going downhill.
 <br>
 I mean, he&#39;s sitting over there in the dark, eating ketchup off crackers.
 <br>
 I ate gum off a parking meter once.
 <br>
 But it was on a dare.
 <br>
 I made $1.
 <br>
 Man, there&#39;s some suckers out there.
 <br>
 Crackers and ketchup are &#34;K&#34; words.
 <br>
 Which makes them naturally funny.
 <br>
 My God.
 <br>
 I can feel, like, all the molecules in my body.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna count them.
 <br>
 One two three You guys disgust me.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t anyone care about Hyde? My God, run, Scooby.
 <br>
 Now.
 <br>
 Run.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s freaking me out? I saw Jackie sick, without makeup.
 <br>
 And it was the freakiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire, entire life.
 <br>
 Including the class trip to the sausage factory.
 <br>
 Ay.
 <br>
 If I never see the inside of another cow, it will be too soon.
 <br>
 Jerky? eighteen nineteen I have the biggest hands in the world! Damn it! One, two So his mom&#39;s gone and I know he doesn&#39;t want any help but the Donner Party didn&#39;t get any help, and then they ate each other so Hey, don&#39;t bogart that jerky.
 <br>
 Yeah, no parents would be cool.
 <br>
 Like the Lord of the Flies.
 <br>
 Kelso, did you ever finish Lord of the Flies? No.
 <br>
 So? Nothing.
 <br>
 Look, what are we going to do about Hyde? I think we should tell someone.
 <br>
 What am I gonna do about Jackie? I can&#39;t even look at her.
 <br>
 She&#39;s unpleasant when she&#39;s healthy, so I can only imagine how she looks like.
 <br>
 Kelso Jackie&#39;s my friend and you&#39;re shallow and pathetic.
 <br>
 And you know what else? My hands are huge! They&#39;re like boxing gloves.
 <br>
 I am the greatest! Okay, champ, whatever you say - Hello, Bob.
 <br>
 - Hi, Bob.
 <br>
 Sharon.
 <br>
 Bologna? Bob, what are you doing? Nothing.
 <br>
 We were just talking.
 <br>
 These Jordan almonds are for the feminists.
 <br>
 Yeah, sorry.
 <br>
 Come on, Sharon, I saved you a seat on the ottoman.
 <br>
 I mean, &#34;ottowoman.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;m sick of bologna.
 <br>
 I want a new sandwich.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not abandoning Steven, she&#39;s his mother.
 <br>
 Mom, her exact words were &#34;I know I&#39;m your mother &#34;but I&#39;m abandoning you, Steven.
 <br>
 &#34; That doesn&#39;t sound very good.
 <br>
 No, sirree.
 <br>
 Red? Look, Eric.
 <br>
 You know I&#39;d love to help Steven.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a giver.
 <br>
 But you can&#39;t squeeze blood from a stone, son.
 <br>
 You know, we could just pop over there just to check up on him.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not going over there.
 <br>
 That&#39;s final.
 <br>
 I am not Santa Claus.
 <br>
 Thank God you&#39;re not Santa Claus, Red.
 <br>
 You scare the hell out of children.
 <br>
 Go away, Michael.
 <br>
 Jackie, please? I really need to talk to you.
 <br>
 I want to apologize for screaming when I looked at you the other day.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just you looked really gross.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I realized something.
 <br>
 I realized that just because you look bad now that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re gonna look bad forever.
 <br>
 I mean, I just saw your mom downstairs and even though she&#39;s pretty old, she&#39;s really hot.
 <br>
 And that gives me hope for the future.
 <br>
 Oh, Michael.
 <br>
 Let me finish.
 <br>
 I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I realized that this whole mess that&#39;s just a temporary thing.
 <br>
 But physical beauty, that lasts forever.
 <br>
 That is so true.
 <br>
 Later, baby.
 <br>
 Later.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 And I tell them I can sell them the cheaper one but it&#39;ll wind up costing them more in the long run.
 <br>
 Which is a mathematical impossibility, but they buy it anyway.
 <br>
 I just love a man who&#39;s passionate about his work.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve got a little something right there.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, this is Sharon.
 <br>
 She&#39;s part of your mom&#39;s feminist group.
 <br>
 She hates men, too.
 <br>
 I should be getting back to the meeting.
 <br>
 Why are you all dressed up? I&#39;m not dressed up.
 <br>
 This is California casual.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing going on here.
 <br>
 Everything is fine between your mother and me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, can&#39;t a man have a conversation with an attentive woman without getting the third degree? Sure, Dad.
 <br>
 All right, apology accepted.
 <br>
 Now, be a good girl and sneak in there and get Daddy some of those Jordan almonds.
 <br>
 No, Dad, those are for the feminists.
 <br>
 God.
 <br>
 They got to her, too.
 <br>
 You You need a coffee table.
 <br>
 Yeah, that would really pull the room together.
 <br>
 Steven, I was gonna clean your kitchen for you, but frankly I&#39;m afraid.
 <br>
 Well, it looks like he&#39;s got everything under control.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;ll be in the car.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Steven, why don&#39;t you go and gather some clothes and I&#39;ll do a load of wash for you at our house.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t let him live like this.
 <br>
 Kitty, he&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 I mean, compared to Korea, this place is Shangri-la wrapped in happy-fun candy.
 <br>
 Look, you know I&#39;d like to help him.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t have the money.
 <br>
 - I suppose we could call social services.
 <br>
 - Yeah, see, now that&#39;s sensible.
 <br>
 - Yeah, they&#39;ll know what to do.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 I mean, after all, they take thousands of cases every year.
 <br>
 So many, in fact, that they have to house them in gymnasiums.
 <br>
 Kitty! With no heat.
 <br>
 Damn it! I am tired of being Santa Claus! Steven, you get your together and you get your ass in the damn car! We&#39;re going! Now damn it! Move it! Okay.
 <br>
 You are just the sweetest man alive.
 <br>
 You know, Red really yelled at me, Forman.
 <br>
 Yeah, get used to that.
 <br>
 This blows, man.
 <br>
 When I was living at home, I didn&#39;t have to answer to anybody.
 <br>
 I made my own rules.
 <br>
 You screwed me, Forman.
 <br>
 I told you this was none of your business.
 <br>
 Steven.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your cocoa.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t kick your ass.
 <br>
 Are you gonna eat your cookies? - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I gotta get a tattoo.
 <br>
 - Please don&#39;t.
 <br>
 That&#39;s incredible.
 <br>
 But disgusting.
 <br>
 That, that&#39;s incredible and disgusting.
 <br>
 - Do you want to see her pick up a dime? - No! - How about a quarter? - No!
 <br>
