<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 hey, thanks for coming down to meet my sister, man.
 <br>
 I had dinner with her and my dad last night, it was the first family dinner I had ever been to where we didn&#39;t have to sneak out of the restaurant one at a time.
 <br>
 Man, hyde, first a new dad, now a new sister-- it&#39;s like you hit the orphan lottery.
 <br>
 Look, your dad&#39;s got a whole jar of peppermint patties.
 <br>
 That&#39;s class, baby.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nothing, you guys.
 <br>
 I found and I kind of wanna steal it.
 <br>
 Wow, I&#39;m really starting to see the underbelly of not having a job.
 <br>
 Check it out, hyde-- your dad knows Skynyrd.
 <br>
 I heard when you first meet them, if you just yell &#34;free bird&#34; really loud, they&#39;ll start playing it.
 <br>
 Ah, angie, meet your new brother&#39;s friends-- they&#39;re scruffy, but they don&#39;t seem to be dangerous.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, check it out- family &#39;fro.
 <br>
 I know what you&#39;re thinking.
 <br>
 What are the odds that steven would have a previously unknown black half-sister? Well, I&#39;ll tell you-- I&#39;m a math major.
 <br>
 A math major? Awesome.
 <br>
 I need some help building a homemade rocket, and we also need a hamster that&#39;s not afraid of heights or being blown up.
 <br>
 - You must be kelso.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I am.
 <br>
 Boy, am I glad you showed up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a lot of pressure being the only good-looking one in the room.
 <br>
 Michael, that is so rude.
 <br>
 You know there&#39;s two of us.
 <br>
 And that makes you Jackie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Okay, so let me bring you up to speed on the group.
 <br>
 Too skinny, too tall, too horny, too foreign, too-riffic.
 <br>
 Look at this-- my two kids together and getting along.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it, 20 bucks for everybody.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I already got mine.
 <br>
 I took it off your desk.
 <br>
 I&#39;m at a really weird place in my life.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 08 &#34;Angie&#34; Hey, man.
 <br>
 Hey, I brought everyone cupcakes.
 <br>
 - Cool! - Cupcakes! Here&#39;s a special one for you-- vanilla on the outside and chocolate on the inside.
 <br>
 what are you doing? You knew I was gonna take that one.
 <br>
 Oh, well, too late.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always doing that.
 <br>
 That is the reason why we broke up.
 <br>
 We broke up because you were always cheating on me.
 <br>
 That and the cupcake thing.
 <br>
 So this is where you hang out, huh? Do the people who own this place know we&#39;re down here? Yeah, they kind of adopted me.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know this about me, but I&#39;ve had, like, 13 dads.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t know so much about you.
 <br>
 I mean, like, what kind of stuff did you do growing up? Did you play sports? Well, I used to play this one game called stoop.
 <br>
 What you do is you sit on a stoop and you chuck things at passersby.
 <br>
 I was a pro.
 <br>
 I was a passerby.
 <br>
 Did you know that I am a shampoo boy down at the beauty salon? Yes, ladies come from miles around to be touched by these magic hands.
 <br>
 Is that why they&#39;re all dry and chapped? No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s from my day off.
 <br>
 So, angie, are you excited about your first day at work at dad&#39;s office tomorrow? Yeah, but I&#39;m a little nervous.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s my first job out of college.
 <br>
 Oh, believe me, this is the easiest job I&#39;ve ever had.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 What about the time you got paid 2 bucks to eat everything out of forman&#39;s fridge and then you threw it up all over the place? That was you.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 That was awesome.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s cool if we slack off at work.
 <br>
 Look, any time I even think about work, I remember one thing-- I&#39;m the boss&#39;s son, then I head down to the nearest bar to chug beer and play darts.
 <br>
 Ah, beer and darts-- keeping the eye patch industry alive since the 1800s.
 <br>
 Kitty, you told me we were going to the hardware store.
 <br>
 And you told me I&#39;d have a fur coat by winter.
 <br>
 People say a lot of things.
 <br>
 But this is no place for a man.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s 25 ladies and me.
 <br>
 I think I like my chances.
 <br>
 Kitty, I gotta get out of here.
 <br>
 One of these ladies is likely to come over here and try to talk me into a toupee.
 <br>
 Okay, Fez give me the gossip.
 <br>
 Is that glitter in your hair? Are you making me a piÑata? No.
 <br>
 I was working on a new outfit for eric to wear at the roller disco.
 <br>
 Roller disco? Eric is into roller disco? Uh-oh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna have to reschedule &#39;cause I have to go spread this embarrassing news.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t tell anyone.
 <br>
 I promised eric I&#39;d keep it a secret.
 <br>
 Besides, you used to roller disco with jackie.
 <br>
 Sure, when I was a child, but I&#39;m a man now.
 <br>
 I moved on to robot dancing.
 <br>
 Hey, you wanted to see me? Have a seat, steven.
 <br>
 It&#39;s  come to my attention you&#39;ve been sneaking off from work to go play darts.
 <br>
 Well, in my defense, it&#39;s just something to do to pass the time while I&#39;m drinking beer.
 <br>
 Yes, Angie mentioned that, too.
 <br>
 What? You ratted me out on my midday dart-and-booze? What? No, I just thought it was a funny story.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 Daddy, please don&#39;t fire him.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna fire him.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not? I mean you&#39;re not-- excellent choice.
 <br>
 S teven, you may be the boss&#39; son, but you still have to show up and do some work.
 <br>
 Come on, man, even you said yourself it was fine if I slack off every now and then.
 <br>
 Look, I want you to succeed here, Steven, so no more darts.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Oh, but can I start succeeding next week? See, there&#39;s a tournament tomorrow.
 <br>
 I&#39;m already signed up and everything.
 <br>
 There&#39;s my little roller disco king.
 <br>
 Mom ! Look, at any given moment, there at least three kids in this house who would use that information to destroy me.
 <br>
 We have to keep it our secret.
 <br>
 Well, I was just reading the bible, and it says that keeping secrets is a sin.
 <br>
 It goes lust, gluttony, sloth, keeping secrets.
 <br>
 Mom, we don&#39;t even have a bible.
 <br>
 Remember last christmas you spilled peppermint schnapps all over it? Honey, just share your secret.
 <br>
 People are gonna find out eventually because that is a surprisingly difficult thing to keep secret.
 <br>
 Okay, I don&#39;t know if you know this about me, but I already take quite a bit of crap just walking around being regular me, so, No, I&#39;m not gonna tell anybody.
 <br>
 Do you want me to tell them? - No.
 <br>
 - Yes? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll think about it, okay? Maybe there&#39;s a way I can kind of feel everybody out.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 and by the way, I did not spill peppermints chnapps on the bible.
 <br>
 It was sambuca.
 <br>
 I am not trailer trash.
 <br>
 I know something you don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Fez, you know a lot of things I don&#39;t know, mostly because they&#39;re disgusting and I don&#39;t wanna know them.
 <br>
 True, but this is about eric.
 <br>
 What do you think he&#39;s doing every wednesday night when he&#39;s not with you? He&#39;s taking an at-home spanish course.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t wanna be disturbed, so he locks himself in his room.
 <br>
 You know, I think he&#39;s self-conscious because he can&#39;t roll his &#34;R&#34;s.
 <br>
 Oh, believe me, donna, he is rolling his ass off.
 <br>
 Okay, fez, what&#39;s going on? Is there another woman? Yes and it&#39;s eric.
 <br>
 Angie totally set me up, man.
 <br>
 I should have seen this coming when I found out she was a math major.
 <br>
 Those girls are always bitches.
 <br>
 You know what your problem is, hyde? I&#39;m too good-looking.
 <br>
 Who does angie think she is, anyway? She can&#39;t just walk in here and pull your strings like you&#39;re some kind of puppet.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my job.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, just to jump off topic here for a sec, when you&#39;re dancing to say,like, Donna Summer, whoever, do you ever wish that you were on wheels? Forman, so many parts of what you just said make me wanna kick your ass.
 <br>
 Eric, you know what your problem is? I&#39;m too good-looking.
 <br>
 Okay, it&#39;s wednesday night, so you guys know what that means-- off to my room for a little espaÑol, or should I say off to my room-o? You got a lot of nerve showing up here.
 <br>
 All right, back off, hyde.
 <br>
 She&#39;s here for me.
 <br>
 Hey, mama.
 <br>
 Hey, so what the hell was that all about today? Look, my dad said that if I did well in college, some day the business would be mine, and I did my part, so there&#39;s no way I&#39;m gonna share everything with some frizzy-haired kid fresh out of juvie.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m working at that company because our dad wants me there, and don&#39;t insult me with that juvie crap.
 <br>
 I&#39;m over 18.
 <br>
 If I get pinched, I&#39;m doing big boy time.
 <br>
 Running this company is my dream, so if you don&#39;t quit tomorrow, it&#39;s gonna be war.
 <br>
 He&#39;s your friend.
 <br>
 Talk some sense into him.
 <br>
 If you wanted my help, you should have brought more cupcakes.
 <br>
 Fez, come on.
 <br>
 Just tell us what eric&#39;s up to.
 <br>
 Donna, if I learned anything from all my years as a virgin, it&#39;s that seeing it is much better than talking about it.
 <br>
 what the hell was that? That, donna, that&#39;s what&#39;s left of your boyfriend.
 <br>
 So, steven, what are you gonna do about angie? How are you gonna fight back? I  don&#39;t know that I am.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re asking me to fight for a job.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a tough sell.
 <br>
 But this is my company at stake.
 <br>
 Jackie, would you stop saying that everything that&#39;s mine is yours? Okay, steven, last valentine&#39;s day I gave you a card that said &#34;be mine,&#34; and you said yes.
 <br>
 And by saying yes, you agreed that everything you had, have or will have from now until the end of time is mine as well.
 <br>
 Read the fine print, steven.
 <br>
 This whole work thing is a mess.
 <br>
 I miss my glory days of being an orphan.
 <br>
 A little piece of advice about having a family-- get used to being screwed over.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a very cynical view of family.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, and you and your sister get along so well.
 <br>
 Oh, I talked to a lawyer.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not getting a damn thing.
 <br>
 Red, we have something to tell you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s pretty shocking.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not sure how to break it to you.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;d better let me handle this.
 <br>
 All right, Everybody whose son is not a roller disco-er, take one step forward.
 <br>
 Not so fast, red.
 <br>
 Someone&#39;s been working on their spin, susie.
 <br>
 Nice, very nice.
 <br>
 It&#39;s magic time.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody, let&#39;s give a great bigroller palace welcome to the one, the only rainbow! nice shorts, rainbow.
 <br>
 Hey, did you come up to pack up your office? Listen, sis, about the whole job thing, I thought about going head-to-head with you, but I decided I just can&#39;t stoop to your level.
 <br>
 Well, good.
 <br>
 But she can.
 <br>
 Right now she&#39;s telling everybody we work with that you stripped your way through college.
 <br>
 Please, like anybody&#39;s gonna believe her.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s rich.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, no.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t strip because you needed the money.
 <br>
 Word around the water cooler is you stripped because you liked it.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know, I know.
 <br>
 What a whore.
 <br>
 Stop laughing at me.
 <br>
 I am not a stripper.
 <br>
 I am a math major.
 <br>
 Jackie, if there was ever a game show called &#34;make that girl cry,&#34; I&#39;d go on with you.
 <br>
 Oh, we&#39;d so win the car.
 <br>
 all right, everybody clear some space.
 <br>
 It&#39;s rainbow! Now look, eric, they love you, so it&#39;s a good thing I told fez.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t tell you I told fez.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t tell fez.
 <br>
 Eric, how did this happen? I mean, you don&#39;t just wake up one morning, throw on some skates, and start doing cartwheels to sister sledge.
 <br>
 It all started when I went down to the sporting goods store.
 <br>
 I saw this pair of roller skates, and when I tried them on, well, it was like the first time Joe Namath laid his hands on a bat.
 <br>
 The next thing I can remember is spinning, just spinning and spinning and spinning.
 <br>
 When I finally stopped, I found myself at the park.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where I met up with these people.
 <br>
 Wait, those skate freaks that hang out down by the basketball court? Every time we wanna shoot hoops, we gotta scare them off with bottle rockets.
 <br>
 Kelso, they&#39;re not freaks.
 <br>
 They&#39;re just like you and me, but on wheels.
 <br>
 Eric, let me tell you a little story.
 <br>
 When I was a boy, there was a kid who wanted to be a ballet dancer, and all the other kids made fun of him.
 <br>
 But years later when he came back to town, he had achieved his dream-- he was a dancer with the New York City Ballet.
 <br>
 And you know what happened? You learned your little lesson about judging people unfairly, huh? No, a bunch of guys got together and beat the crap out of him.
 <br>
 Hey, red, you know what your problem is? I&#39;m too good-looking.
 <br>
 Okay, dad, I hear what you&#39;re saying, but I honestly don&#39;t know if I can give it up.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you try something else? I suggest robot dancing.
 <br>
 feel the beat.
 <br>
 Disco robot.
 <br>
 Daddy, I can&#39;t work with him.
 <br>
 He&#39;s telling lies about me.
 <br>
 Actually, that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 She&#39;s telling them.
 <br>
 Steven, why is that girl always in the office? And why has she been passing out dress code memos to my employees? Hum Well, she&#39;s against the casualization of the workplace.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t belong here, and neither does he.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m seeing-- a brother and sister fighting each other.
 <br>
 Hey, we are a family.
 <br>
 Look, if you want him to stay, that&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 But if he stays, I&#39;m out of here.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s too bad, because I&#39;m opening up a new record store and I wanted the two of you to run it, but  maybe I&#39;ll just let Steven run it by himself.
 <br>
 Hell yeah! Nice going, sis.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 You know I&#39;ve always wanted my own store.
 <br>
 Well, if you two can&#39;t find a way to work this out-- We can.
 <br>
 I know we can.
 <br>
 He&#39;s my brother.
 <br>
 I tried to get him fired, he calls me a stripper-- this is how we play.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad, because if this kept going, I would have had to send the two of you to your offices without any dinner.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a bad joke.
 <br>
 I love it.
 <br>
 So looks like you&#39;re gonna have to put up with me after all.
 <br>
 Hey, I said I&#39;d work with you.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t mean I like you.
 <br>
 You not liking me doesn&#39;t bother me that much now that I won.
 <br>
 And by &#34;I won,&#34; I mean you lost.
 <br>
 Oh, and also you know, here I&#39;m just an average kid, but down there down there I was a star.
 <br>
 what? Oh, did I make the kissy face too early again? No, no, it&#39;s nothing.
 <br>
 What? Why do you keep laughing at me? I&#39;m gonna go home and I&#39;m gonna watch a really sad movie and I&#39;m gonna try to come back later.
 <br>
