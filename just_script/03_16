 [Grunts] Hey.
 <br>
 What are you guys up to? We&#39;re spending the weekend at a hotel.
 <br>
 What, car sex isn&#39;t good enough anymore? I would love car sex.
 <br>
 Or just sex.
 <br>
 Or just a car.
 <br>
 I have to get out of town.
 <br>
 Ever since my dad lost the store he just shuffles around in a not-completely-closed bathrobe.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really depressing.
 <br>
 &#34;The Wisconsin Dells&#39; most romantic hideaway.
 <br>
 Hunters and truckers always welcome.
 <br>
 &#34; - That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - Sounds awesome.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go pack.
 <br>
 You guys.
 <br>
 The weirdest thing just happened with Pam Macy.
 <br>
 Kelso, man, she&#39;ll do that with any guy standing in front of her.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;m making out with Pam in the orchestra pit and everything is progressin&#39; like normal until- - What? - You know the really, really bad thing that can happen to guys when they&#39;re with girls.
 <br>
 Oh, did Mr.
 <br>
 Cooper come in to buff the floor? No.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Let me put it this way.
 <br>
 The buffer wouldn&#39;t buff.
 <br>
 Poor Mr.
 <br>
 Cooper.
 <br>
 No, Fez.
 <br>
 I think what he&#39;s tryin&#39; to say is the rabbit wouldn&#39;t come out of the hat.
 <br>
 The weasel wouldn&#39;t pop.
 <br>
 The alphabet soup never spelled &#34;go.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay! All right! Enough! Actually, not quite.
 <br>
 There are a lot of Amish people but they never raised a barn.
 <br>
 Forman, man, that was awesome.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 It just came to me.
 <br>
 Oh, I get it.
 <br>
 The barn is Kelso&#39;s pants.
 <br>
 [Whimpers] Okay! You guys, this is not funny! - This is, like, a nightmare.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 Eric, stop teasing.
 <br>
 Kelso, I want you to know that I feel bad for you and that I am sorry you are not a man! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! So, looks like I&#39;m gonna spend the weekend with Kelso- tutor him in math.
 <br>
 Really.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re allegedly tutoring Kelso in math.
 <br>
 - Yes, sir.
 <br>
 - Are you good in math? What&#39;s the square root of&#34;x&#34;? - Um, I really can&#39;t answer that.
 <br>
 - Aha! No.
 <br>
 See, &#34;x&#34; is a variable, so until you define its parameters the only possible answer is a variable- or &#34;x&#34; if you prefer.
 <br>
 Is that right? Sounds good.
 <br>
 - Will Michael&#39;s parents be home? - Yes.
 <br>
 Are they as dumb as he is? I can&#39;t lie.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, they are.
 <br>
 Right answer.
 <br>
 That was a trick question.
 <br>
 I know they&#39;re dumb.
 <br>
 So, I can go? You can go, but I&#39;ll be watching the news.
 <br>
 And if anything is vandalized or explodes or catches on fire &#34;x&#34; is gonna equal me kicking your ass.
 <br>
 So, anyway, Jackie&#39;s, uh, havin&#39; trouble in school stuff and, uh, I thought I should stay with her this weekend- tutor her in, you know, stuff.
 <br>
 - Anyone? - I&#39;m sorry, honey.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t concentrate when your father&#39;s robe is open.
 <br>
 Leave me alone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ventilating.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 See ya Sunday.
 <br>
 [Man] Jeannie, I&#39;m home.
 <br>
 - [Boing] - Oh.
 <br>
 Hello, GenieJackie.
 <br>
 Hello, Master Major Michael.
 <br>
 How was your day? Pretty good, pretty good.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m starvin&#39;.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been on the moon all day, and I missed lunch.
 <br>
 - I can fix that.
 <br>
 - [Boing] Damn.
 <br>
 I love havin&#39; a genie.
 <br>
 - Well, let&#39;s eat.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Unless you&#39;re hungry for something besides food, Master.
 <br>
 [Boing] Actually, I&#39;m havin&#39; a little problem in this department lately.
 <br>
 - Not anymore.
 <br>
 - [Boing] Ho-ho! You&#39;re the best genie ever! [Beeping] Hello? Pam? I&#39;m back! [Laughing] You know, Red, with the house empty this weekend it might be a- a nice opportunity for a little romance.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Is that, &#34;Uh-huh, my passion burns for you&#34; or &#34;Uh-huh, you&#39;re as exciting as an old hat&#34;? Well, what kind of old hat? How about a hat that&#39;s about to be super P.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 &#39;d? Oh.
 <br>
 Then the passion one.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna sneak some beer outta the fridge.
 <br>
 You go be lookout.
 <br>
 You can count on me.
 <br>
 [Objects Clattering] Hyde, the Formans are home.
 <br>
 - A little late, Fez.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s funnier this way.
 <br>
 Okay, you two, out.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Here, you can each have a Snack Pack.
 <br>
 [Together] Thank you, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Ooh.
 <br>
 Chocolate.
 <br>
 Okay, Kitty.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna cook you a romantic dinner.
 <br>
 So, you go put on something pretty and I&#39;ll warm up the toaster oven.
 <br>
 Oh, wow.
 <br>
 Dinner from the toaster oven.
 <br>
 Ha ha.
 <br>
 Well, whoop-de-do.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll put on my fancy dress.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna work on Plan &#34;B.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, I would.
 <br>
 This place is awesome.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 There&#39;s gotta be, like, 17 pillows on this bed.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a tiny fridge with, like, a million bottles of tiny liquor.
 <br>
 [Gasps] And tiny cookies.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah? Well, in there- tiny shampoo and tiny soap.
 <br>
 Donna, I think elves work here.
 <br>
 I feel so classy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m stealing all of it.
 <br>
 Look, Pam, I&#39;m really sorry about what happened again.
 <br>
 I must have the flu or something.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s not like any flu I&#39;ve ever heard of.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s lots of kinds of flu, Pam! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Oh, well, don&#39;t take it so hard.
 <br>
 Oops.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Look, just don&#39;t tell anybody, okay? Oh, Flopsy, I&#39;m not gonna tell anybody.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna tell everybody.
 <br>
 - [Radio: Loud Rock] - Eric.
 <br>
 Do you know that if you mix Kahl√∫a and scotch, it tastes just like Dr.
 <br>
 Pepper? You&#39;re cute.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;re cute too and a little drunk- which is gonna make my job a whole lot easier.
 <br>
 [Pounding] What&#39;s that? - I guess the guy next door thinks we&#39;re being too loud.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah? What- [Pounding] Oh, my God.
 <br>
 He just pounded right back.
 <br>
 Uh, okay.
 <br>
 You know what? Let&#39;s just be quiet.
 <br>
 - [StoPs] - But then he wins, Eric.
 <br>
 We need to get the last pound.
 <br>
 See? We won.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not gonna take crap.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna give it, &#39;cause we&#39;re fearless.
 <br>
 - [Pounding] - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 He&#39;s at the door.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? I think I have a little fear.
 <br>
 So, let&#39;s just, uh, be really quiet and pretend we&#39;re not here.
 <br>
 - And maybe he&#39;ll just think we&#39;re not here.
 <br>
 - [Whispering] Okay.
 <br>
 Will you cut it out! Okay, look, just stay in here and shush.
 <br>
 - [Loud WhisPer] Okay.
 <br>
 - [Pounding] [Pounding] - Eric! - Dad.
 <br>
 [Giggling] Hey, it&#39;s Big Red.
 <br>
 Son of a bitch! What the hell are you doing here? Wait.
 <br>
 What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Who are you with? Your mother, you dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna make a deal with you.
 <br>
 I never saw you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re good? No, no.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gettin&#39; your ass kicked on Monday.
 <br>
 But for now, you shut up and stay here.
 <br>
 If your mother sees you, my fun time is over.
 <br>
 Oh, this is just awful! Oh.
 <br>
 No, hey, cheer up.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been in trouble with Red before.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s not that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just seeing your dad reminded me of my dad.
 <br>
 Your dad&#39;s going away on nice weekends and having fun and my dad&#39;s out of work and sad.
 <br>
 Plus your robe&#39;s not completely closed, and that reminds me of him too.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? Let&#39;s turn that frown upside-down.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s have super-hot sex, baby.
 <br>
 And by super-hot sex, I mean let&#39;s talk about your sad feelings.
 <br>
 Okay, Jackie, I have some really terrible news about Kelso that will make us both laugh a lot.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I already know.
 <br>
 Pam Macy made this big announcement in gym.
 <br>
 [Laughing] [Chuckles] Jackie, this is where we both laugh a lot.
 <br>
 Actually, Fez, I don&#39;t find it that funny.
 <br>
 I kinda feel sad for him.
 <br>
 But you hate him.
 <br>
 He totally screwed you over.
 <br>
 Yeah, but he&#39;s grown up a lot since then.
 <br>
 And he&#39;s suffered, and I&#39;m over it by now.
 <br>
 Poor Michael.
 <br>
 Poor Michael? Well, I see I have wasted my time talking to you.
 <br>
 Good day, miss.
 <br>
 - Wait, Fez.
 <br>
 - I said good day.
 <br>
 What should we do with all of this time alone? - [Knocking] - I&#39;ll get that.
 <br>
 I ordered you a special surprise.
 <br>
 Ta-da! Donna? Donna is my surprise? Donna? What the heck are you doin&#39; here, Donna? What the heck? Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, Eric is being a jerk, and I wanted to talk to my mom.
 <br>
 But since she&#39;s not here, can I talk to you? [Red] Eric&#39;s here too? What on earth is goin&#39; on? What the heck? - Red, what is going on here? - Oh, I&#39;m just as surprised as you.
 <br>
 Oh, all right! - Eric and Donna are the noisy people next door.
 <br>
 - And you didn&#39;t tell me? Hello, Mommy? I&#39;m sad! [Pounding] Donna, where have you- Your mother kicked me out.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 I said no.
 <br>
 Guys, I gotta tell you somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 I&#39;m omnipotent.
 <br>
 [Laughing] - [Laughing] - [Thud] Huh.
 <br>
 This does taste like Dr.
 <br>
 Pepper.
 <br>
 Told ya.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what? I think I might puke.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, no.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Honey, nobody gets sick in Mr.
 <br>
 And Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s room.
 <br>
 [Laughing] You know, it is a lovely room.
 <br>
 Red just saw the brochure on the counter and then he whisked me up and he brought me here.
 <br>
 It was very Humphrey Bogart.
 <br>
 Eric did the same thing for me.
 <br>
 - Sometimes he&#39;s really sweet.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Do you have a bucket? - [Knocking] - [Man] Room service.
 <br>
 Honey.
 <br>
 Honey, pretty girls do not throw up.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t order this.
 <br>
 Oh, uh, it was ordered by a Mr.
 <br>
 Red Forman.
 <br>
 Oh, my gosh.
 <br>
 This must have been his surprise.
 <br>
 Oh! Flowers, champagne.
 <br>
 Cashews.
 <br>
 The most expensive nut, you know.
 <br>
 Oh, dear, sweet Red.
 <br>
 I have to go see him.
 <br>
 - Are you feeling better? - No.
 <br>
 Okay, good.
 <br>
 Nighty-night.
 <br>
 Why is everything doing that? Hey, Michael.
 <br>
 I heard what happened with Pam.
 <br>
 And I want you to know, that according to CosmoPolitan magazine, you&#39;re not a freak.
 <br>
 - Really? - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 They say that, lots of times when it happens to a guy it&#39;s not that he can&#39;t, it&#39;s just that he secretly doesn&#39;t want to.
 <br>
 Okay, well, not to criticize but Cosmo&#39;s never seen Pam Macy naked.
 <br>
 Michael, just think about it.
 <br>
 Do you like Pam? Well, I like parts of her.
 <br>
 Well, maybe that&#39;s not enough.
 <br>
 And maybe your body&#39;s mature enough to realize that even if your brain isn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Okay, well, you know, if this is about maturity then I want nothing to do with it.
 <br>
 Look, Michael, don&#39;t worry, okay? When you find the girl you&#39;re meant to be with you&#39;ll be able to do all the stuff you want.
 <br>
 I promise.
 <br>
 I hope you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Thanks, Jackie.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m back.
 <br>
 - What? Nothin&#39;.
 <br>
 Good hug! Out.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s my room.
 <br>
 Love ya, sweetie.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 Donna, are you there? - [Knocking] - Donna, Please oPen the door, Please.
 <br>
 [Knocking Continues] Great.
 <br>
 I&#39;m locked out of both rooms.
 <br>
 Well, at least I don&#39;t have any pants.
 <br>
 I want you to open that door right now.
 <br>
 Our daughter&#39;s in there, and she&#39;s drunk.
 <br>
 I really shouldn&#39;t be doing this.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll just sue you until you&#39;re dead.
 <br>
 - [Bob] You get off my daughter.
 <br>
 ! - [Red] Bob.
 <br>
 ! What the hell? [Bob] Red? [Midge] Ooh.
 <br>
 ! Kitty, what a Pretty nightgown.
 <br>
 [Kitty] Thank you, Midge.
 <br>
 Could you hand it to me, Please? Look, I&#39;m sorry about getting all tipsy last night.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Please, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - The fight was all my fault.
 <br>
 - Fight? We had a fight? No.
 <br>
 - What did you do? - Nothing.
 <br>
 Obviously you did something.
 <br>
 I want to know what it is in case I&#39;m still mad about it.
 <br>
 Well, okay.
 <br>
 I had said that you were the most beautiful girl in the world and then you got all mad and said, &#34;Get bent.
 <br>
 &#34; Not your finest hour, but I still love you.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You must be really upset about this.
 <br>
 Um kind of, yeah.
 <br>
 Well, come on, Eric.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s turn that frown upside-down.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s have super-hot sex, baby.
 <br>
 Oh, crap.
 <br>
 Well, GenieJackie, I am in the mood for some hot master-genie lovin&#39;.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Master Major Michael.
 <br>
 But what we are going to have is a warm master-genie friendship.
 <br>
 In fact, I am the master now, and you are the genie.
 <br>
 [Boing] Except you will not have any genie powers.
 <br>
 You will just do as I say.
 <br>
 Now, do my math homework, Genie.
 <br>
 [Boing] [Kelso] No.
 <br>
 !
