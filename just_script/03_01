 Man, who&#39;d have thought? Hyde getting busted for possession.
 <br>
 I mean, I always thought it&#39;d be, like, armed robbery or pimping.
 <br>
 You know, something cool.
 <br>
 [Giggling] Yeah, Hyde in jail.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, do you think he&#39;s anyone&#39;s girlfriend yet? Kelso, he&#39;s been in jail for three hours.
 <br>
 Of course he&#39;s someone&#39;s girlfriend.
 <br>
 He has very pretty eyes.
 <br>
 Well, if he was someone&#39;s girlfriend, I think it might look something like this.
 <br>
 [Kelso Giggling] Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey there, curlicue, would you like to perform an unspeakable act on me or would you prefer that I perform one on you? [High-pitched Voice] Well, they both sound good.
 <br>
 Dealer&#39;s choice.
 <br>
 You have done a horrible thing with a children&#39;s toy.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Huh.
 <br>
 Bet you didn&#39;t want me to see this, did ya? Hey! Welcome back, man! We were worried about- I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just- I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 Yeah, uh- You know, curlicue is- can be- is a term of endearment.
 <br>
 So, when do we meet your new fella? Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! - Red, we really need to talk about- - No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No! - Steven.
 <br>
 ! - No! I don&#39;t want to talk about Steven! Subject closed.
 <br>
 Red- For God&#39;s sakes, Kitty.
 <br>
 We took him into our home.
 <br>
 We treated him like our own son.
 <br>
 Treat him better than your own son.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you one thing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not bailing him out.
 <br>
 He can rot in that jail, for all I care.
 <br>
 Actually, uh, they already let him out.
 <br>
 Gave him probation.
 <br>
 Probation? Well, isn&#39;t that just ducky? You know how they treat their criminals in Russia? First offense, five years in Siberia.
 <br>
 Second offense, 10 years.
 <br>
 Believe you me, there is no third offense.
 <br>
 Unless the criminal likes to make snow angels.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Hey.
 <br>
 Steven brought that stuff into my house.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m Puttin&#39;a stoP to it before things get out of control.
 <br>
 Oh, out of control how? Well, I&#39;ll tell you how.
 <br>
 Say, chum, where ya headed? Just to see my best girl Donna, that&#39;s where.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna split a soda pop.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be keen.
 <br>
 Soda pop, eh? I have something that&#39;s even keener than soda pop.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called marijuana.
 <br>
 &#34;Mari-what-a&#34;? Come.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll show you.
 <br>
 [Ragtime] [Laughing Hysterically] Hyde, you were right.
 <br>
 Marijuana&#39;s the bee&#39;s knees.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 All it takes is one puff to make you hopelessly addicted.
 <br>
 I am hopelessly addicted.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a new shipment, fresh from whatever-the-hell country I am from.
 <br>
 Gee whillikers, Eric.
 <br>
 Where have you been? You missed choir practice.
 <br>
 Sorry, dollface.
 <br>
 But now, thanks to marijuana, I&#39;m incurably insane.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not gonna let a swell kid like you ruin your life.
 <br>
 Not so fast, sister.
 <br>
 I need that for the schoolchildren.
 <br>
 - No! - [Gunshot] Alas, marijuana has ended my young, promising life.
 <br>
 This is what&#39;s happening all over America.
 <br>
 And it could happen in your home, or yours, or yours! I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna happen, Red.
 <br>
 Has Hyde ever pressured you to use this stuff? No.
 <br>
 Absolutely not.
 <br>
 In fact-Yeah, I can honestly say I have never felt any pressure.
 <br>
 Guess who? It&#39;s eitherJackie or the cold, clammy hands of death.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Jackie! [Sighs] Damn it.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, my hero.
 <br>
 When that cop found my bag, and you said it was yours, and they sent you to the big house it was, like, the most romantic thing ever.
 <br>
 Yeah, maybe for you.
 <br>
 I was deloused.
 <br>
 Hey, man, you missed your shift at the Fotohut.
 <br>
 You better have a damn good excuse.
 <br>
 - I got busted.
 <br>
 - Damn.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good excuse.
 <br>
 - So what&#39;d they get you for? - For loving me.
 <br>
 [Laughs] &#39;Cause she&#39;s, like, 14? I got busted for possession.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 Join the club.
 <br>
 Yeah, thanks.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I mean, join the club, man.
 <br>
 We meet every Thursday.
 <br>
 We&#39;re tryin&#39; to raise money for a field trip to Amsterdam.
 <br>
 - Hey there, Red.
 <br>
 Takin&#39; out the trash, I see.
 <br>
 - [Clears Throat] Yeah, well, better late than never.
 <br>
 Is that supposed to mean something, Bob? No.
 <br>
 Just happened to notice that that low-life Hyde you&#39;ve been harboring has been busted for possession.
 <br>
 [Gasps] My gosh! That stuff was right here in our own neighborhood? To think of all the times we had to drive across town - to get it! - Lx-nay, Midge! Well as you all know, we had a little incident yesterday.
 <br>
 And I think that as a family, we should discuss rational solutions to make sure that this never happens again.
 <br>
 Can I start? Um, I&#39;m not comfortable living with a criminal.
 <br>
 I think we should kick Hyde out.
 <br>
 All in favor? Laurie, stop it.
 <br>
 Red, what do you think? Kick him out! Kick him out! Kick him out! Kick him out! Laurie, there is no way we&#39;re kicking Steven out.
 <br>
 Steven, we&#39;re kicking you out.
 <br>
 - Yea, Daddy! - Red! - What? Dad, that&#39;s not fair.
 <br>
 - Not fair? I took him in.
 <br>
 I gave him a shot.
 <br>
 He blew it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s his fault.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t want it in my house.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want it around you two.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t want it! Red, putting him out on the street is not the solution.
 <br>
 This young man needs our guidance now more than ever.
 <br>
 No, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 It&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 Lf, uh, Red thinks that I&#39;m not good enough to live in this house then I guess I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 You know what? You&#39;re-You&#39;re bull- l- I&#39;m-You&#39;re very- I&#39;m- I&#39;m very mad at you! God, this sucks! I can&#39;t believe Red&#39;s kicking you out.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m sorry, where are you supposed to go? I&#39;m gonna go to the Fotohut.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll sleep on the floor.
 <br>
 They got a hose out back.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman made me a sandwich.
 <br>
 Man, this is so wrong! I&#39;m not gonna let you get kicked out for something we all do.
 <br>
 Hey, hey, don&#39;t go draggin&#39; me into this.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m gonna tell Red that I do it too.
 <br>
 [All] No! Have you suddenly become the stupidest man ever? I mean, is Kelso no longer the reigning king? Oh, I&#39;m the king.
 <br>
 This can work.
 <br>
 If I tell Red, then he&#39;s gonna be a hypocrite for kicking you out and not making me go with him.
 <br>
 Because, I mean, he can&#39;t kick me out.
 <br>
 Because, deep down, he loves me.
 <br>
 [Exhales] Look, Forman.
 <br>
 I appreciate what you&#39;re trying to do, you know? But you getting into trouble is not going to help me get out of trouble, okay? - Okay? - Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Everybody just stop worrying, all right? I&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 It will be good for you in the Fotohut.
 <br>
 Maybe you will develop some character.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Get it? Develop? [Laughs] Oh, fine.
 <br>
 I guess I&#39;m not funny.
 <br>
 Kiss my brown ass.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your tea, Leo.
 <br>
 Oh, wow.
 <br>
 Tea, man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s, like, exotic.
 <br>
 [Giggles] Hey, look at me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the king of England! - Off with her head.
 <br>
 - [Giggles Nervously] - Tea.
 <br>
 [Giggles] - Well, um l- I think it&#39;s great that Steven has a boss who cares enough to- to come over and talk to us on his behalf.
 <br>
 So, um, I&#39;m just gonna let you fellas get to know each other.
 <br>
 Sit up straight, Leo.
 <br>
 Hey, man, I don&#39;t think you should kick Hyde out, because he&#39;s a good kid.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s a doper.
 <br>
 - Well, you say that like it&#39;s a bad thing, man.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m gonna let you in on a little secret.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve indulged once or twice myself.
 <br>
 Really? I&#39;m shocked.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 Upstanding businessman.
 <br>
 Last guy you&#39;d expect.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s true, man.
 <br>
 Well, Mr Hippie.
 <br>
 If you say so, that&#39;s good enough for me.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s great, man.
 <br>
 [Grunts] Now, please, get out of my house.
 <br>
 - [Humming] - Okay, what are you writing? Jackie and Steven Hyde.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Jackie Hyde.
 <br>
 Dr.
 <br>
 And Mrs.
 <br>
 Steven Hyde? All right, what&#39;s going on? Okay.
 <br>
 Donna, Steven and I are in love! Um, you do know that he once compared you to a tick, right? Oh, really? Well, if he thinks I&#39;m such a tick why&#39;d he tell the cops the bag was his when it was actually mine? Are you telling me that bag was yours? Yeah! And he went to jail for it! Isn&#39;t that fabulous? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You tick.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the reason this whole mess happened.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, stop.
 <br>
 My head is-Whoo! Jackie, you have to tell the Formans what happened.
 <br>
 Do you know that Red is kicking Hyde out? Oh, God.
 <br>
 No, no, Donna.
 <br>
 That&#39;s perfect! When Hyde is on the streets, he&#39;ll have to turn to me.
 <br>
 And as I care for him and buy him stuff, his love for me will grow.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m telling them.
 <br>
 No! No, no, no.
 <br>
 You cannot ruin this for me, moose! Don&#39;t tell me what to do, midget.
 <br>
 - [Screams] No! - [Thud] Well, well.
 <br>
 Turns out you were all wrong about Steven.
 <br>
 And you wanted to kick him out.
 <br>
 Yes, well-Thanks for telling us the truth, Donna.
 <br>
 And we know it wasn&#39;t easy for you especially with Jackie choking you the whole time.
 <br>
 Um, Steven, wait.
 <br>
 You can stay.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it? Isn&#39;t there anything else you would like to say to this brave and noble young man? [Sighs] You&#39;re right, Kitty.
 <br>
 Dumb-ass! Do you realize that you put your entire future at risk? [Red] What kind of a moron would go and take the fall for some little- Crying and crying and crying.
 <br>
 - When she&#39;s upset, I&#39;m upset.
 <br>
 - [Red&#39;s Voice] And the next thing you know- I had to have tea with that greasy old hippie.
 <br>
 And now I have hippie stink on my couch.
 <br>
 Let me tell you something else.
 <br>
 If you ever do anything like that again I will kick your ass so hard your nose will bleed! And we love you.
 <br>
 So, uh, just so I&#39;m clear everything&#39;s back to normal, right? Yeah, yeah, everything&#39;s back- All right, Dad! I&#39;ve got something to say! Eric, for the love of God, don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Dad, I do it too.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 So you can&#39;t kick Hyde out.
 <br>
 Honey, we already decided not to kick Hyde out.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Then yea.
 <br>
 So, you do it too, huh? Since when? Since when? Uh.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] I am so baked.
 <br>
 I think.
 <br>
 No, yeah, I am.
 <br>
 I think.
 <br>
 You know, guys, I&#39;ve been living my life all wrong.
 <br>
 All I ever thought about was school- studying, reading, homework.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 Hey, man, don&#39;t thank me.
 <br>
 Thank my mom.
 <br>
 If she hadn&#39;t have passed out, I couldn&#39;t have raided her stash.
 <br>
 You have the best mom ever.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Hey, guys, you know what? Yesterday, I was wrestling with Donna.
 <br>
 And I felt her boob.
 <br>
 It was beautiful and squishy.
 <br>
 Squishy.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, I had this dream that I was kissing my English teacher.
 <br>
 And when I woke up, I was stuck to my bed.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Kelso, man, that&#39;s not normal.
 <br>
 You could die.
 <br>
 Hey, isn&#39;t your English teacher a guy? Yeah.
 <br>
 No! I meant my Spanish teacher.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a girl.
 <br>
 Man! What&#39;s in this stuff? Hey, guys, I&#39;m having the best time ever.
 <br>
 I think.
 <br>
 No, yeah, I am.
 <br>
 [Red] Eric? [Red] Eric.
 <br>
 ! Are you on it right now? I asked you a question.
 <br>
 Since when have you been using this? Uh, &#39;bout a week ago tomorrow.
 <br>
 Um, what? Yeah! Coming, Mom! Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, now.
 <br>
 You&#39;re both smart boys.
 <br>
 What were you thinking? - Well, l- I&#39;m not- - Oh, oh, um- - The problem was that we weren&#39;t thinking.
 <br>
 - We weren&#39;t thinking.
 <br>
 [Eric] And, you know, with the times we&#39;re living in.
 <br>
 Yeah, the times are, like- [Exhales] - And, um- - Peer pressure.
 <br>
 And the peer pressure.
 <br>
 Thank you, Mom.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Yeah, and I found that today, the need to experiment- Oh! Don&#39;t try this blaming society crap with me.
 <br>
 You know whose fault this is? Do you? Do you? Well, I have a pretty good idea.
 <br>
 It&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 The problem is I&#39;ve been too lenient.
 <br>
 So, from now on, no more easygoin&#39;, devil-may-care, everybody&#39;s-best-friend dad.
 <br>
 [Nervous Laughing] I&#39;m just- I&#39;m so very nervous.
 <br>
 I&#39;m cracking down.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m cracking down hard.
 <br>
 Starting right now fun time is over! So where was I for fun time? - Take it back! - No, Kelso.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Confessing to Red makes Eric the king.
 <br>
 Hey, I shot my toe with a B.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 Gun once.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, Kelso.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the king.
 <br>
 Thank you! I mean, when I say, &#34;For the love of God, don&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#34; Then, for the love of God, don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Donna, that could have meant anything.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I made a terrible mistake.
 <br>
 All right, excuse me.
 <br>
 But I think we&#39;ve all lost sight of what&#39;s really important here.
 <br>
 We&#39;re in love.
 <br>
 All right, all right.
 <br>
 You know what? Enough of your girly fantasy crap.
 <br>
 None of this would have happened if it wasn&#39;t for you.
 <br>
 So get this through your little Easy-Bake Oven head- I don&#39;t love you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 I can barely stand to look at you.
 <br>
 Okay? Oh, Steven, you&#39;re such a bad liar! [Sniffs] All right.
 <br>
 Well, don&#39;t mind me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just here to install this smoke detector.
 <br>
 Smoke detector? Does that detect any kind of smoke? Long live the king.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, look what I found in my sister Laurie&#39;s drawer.
 <br>
 Mints.
 <br>
 A whole month&#39;s worth.
 <br>
 They&#39;re not minty.
 <br>
 They&#39;re not mints.
 <br>
 They&#39;re birth control pills, you headgear-wearing moron.
 <br>
 Hey, when I grow up, I&#39;m gonna be handsome.
 <br>
 Really? Did your Mommy tell you that? Yeah.
 <br>
 Kelso, you&#39;re the king.
 <br>
 <br>
