<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers! You naughty kitty! Ill be right home, keep my bed warm, okay? Hey, keep your paws to yourself! Thats my girlfriend.
 <br>
 So what was your favorite part of the movie? Uh, my favorite part of the movie was when we made out.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Movies are fun.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Goodnight.
 <br>
 You know, its amazing how you always manage to pull the car right up to the garage, but not actually in to it.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Takes a keen eye, and a sure foot.
 <br>
 How would you like your keen eye to watch my sure foot kick your smart ass? Why dont I pull the car in? What the? Youre moving it a foot, and you hit something! Oh, god, no! Its its Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers! Wow, that is one dead cat.
 <br>
 If I was stranded on a desert island with only one form of cheese no question, it would have to be the puff.
 <br>
 You know whos my little cheese puff? Jackie! Oh, Michael, youre so cute! Youre cute! Cuter! Cutest! All right, all right! You guys gotta shut up before I blow cheese puff chunks.
 <br>
 All right Michael, Ill see you tonight at eight.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Ill be counting the minutes.
 <br>
 Cant you just use a clock? Man, were so back in love! I remember when it was all Youre an idiot, Michael, and, Whoa, whatd I do? Good times.
 <br>
 Sorry man, but I love her.
 <br>
 Yes, but you dont deserve her, you son of a bitch.
 <br>
 Nowhat? I saiduh, good cheese puffs, you son of a bitch.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 I thought wed get together tonight, so, take a shower, okay? But Laurie, Im, Im seeing Jackie tonight.
 <br>
 Oh, thats so sweet! Uh, no.
 <br>
 Ill see you at eight.
 <br>
 But, but You heard me! Damn! My second girlfriend is such a drag.
 <br>
 This is bad, man.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 But only for you.
 <br>
 Cheese puff? Thats pretty good, Mr.
 <br>
 Clean.
 <br>
 Ha! Ha ha! Well, you know me! Imsuper neat! Hey, you know, I cant find Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers anywhere.
 <br>
 Have you seen him? No! Uh, I meanwellyeah, not since last night.
 <br>
 Huh, well Meow, meow, meow, meow, KILLED, meow, meow.
 <br>
 What?!? I said its weird! He always sleeps with me but he never came home last night.
 <br>
 Lemme know if you see him, okay? Oh, sure thing! Will do.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers! Yeah, Im going to hell.
 <br>
 You didnt tell her? I felt so guilty, I justI couldnt.
 <br>
 Is it because youre kinda glad its dead? No.
 <br>
 Hey, maybe I dont have to tell her.
 <br>
 Maybe shell just think Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers ran away.
 <br>
 - That works.
 <br>
 Thats what we told you when, um - Shhh! What? Eric, honey, eat your pizza rolls.
 <br>
 Oh, come on.
 <br>
 How hard can this be? You go over there, and you say, hey.
 <br>
 Im a cat killer.
 <br>
 I mur I murdered your cat.
 <br>
 But you try to say it with a straight face.
 <br>
 What? Am I the only one that sees the humor in this? I think you might be, Red.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, that thing was always messing in my yard, going through our garbage Now we have Hyde for that.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, Laurie, and what exactly do you do? Oh! Thats right.
 <br>
 The Packers! Excuse me, dilemma here? Eric, this is not a dilemma.
 <br>
 You have to tell Donna.
 <br>
 Just be gentle and, and maybe take her a nice little gift.
 <br>
 Yeah, like a kitty sized head stone.
 <br>
 You know what? I should have known you were lying.
 <br>
 Sure, Flipper was fast, butturtles dont just run away.
 <br>
 Hyde? Which ones your favorite Charlies Angel? I kinda like the blonde with the huge rack.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 And she distracts the criminals with her huge rack.
 <br>
 Heh.
 <br>
 - Plus shes got that huge rack.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Ow, my stomach.
 <br>
 My cheesy puffy friends have become my enemy.
 <br>
 Man, you guys, I gotta break up with Laurie.
 <br>
 Kelso, remember how you said you were gonna juggle em both til it blew up in your face? Yeah.
 <br>
 Wellkablooie! Okay, I know I tried before, right? But this time, Lauriell see how much I love Jackie, and that my motives are good and pure.
 <br>
 And then shell just let me go Then you and all the leprechauns can ride unicorns to a wonderful celebration in fairy land! Look! The angels are running in slow motion! Damn! Thats just good TV.
 <br>
 Hey, beautiful! Hows it going? Oh, pretty good.
 <br>
 Except I found this here kitten who told me he was looking for someone to love him.
 <br>
 Oh my god! Oh, hes so cute! Thank you Eric, thats so sweet! Well, I hope Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers doesnt get jealous! Hi! Yea, I dont think thats gonna happen, Donna, because I accidentally killed Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers.
 <br>
 So! What are you gonna name this little fella here? What? What are you talking about? Ive had that cat since I was three! What happened? Well, last night, I waspulling in the car after our date After our date? Last night? Eric, I was looking for him and I asked you.
 <br>
 And you said you hadnt seen him.
 <br>
 And you knew I was worried sick about him! I know, Donna! Thats why it was so hard to tell you.
 <br>
 Hey there, ho there, hi there.
 <br>
 Whats going on? Why dont you ask the man who murdered our cat? No! No! Thats not, I didnt murder your cat! It was he climbed under my car.
 <br>
 It was a total accident.
 <br>
 Well I should hope so, because what did he ever do to you? I dont wanna live with this lying anymore.
 <br>
 Because I only love Jackie.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, do you wanna go up to my room and have sex? Uh.
 <br>
 sure! No, wait! No! No! Okay, IthisLaurie, IIm serious.
 <br>
 Were over.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I think you really mean it.
 <br>
 I totally do.
 <br>
 Okay, Kelso, youre free! You know what Id like, though? Just one last goodbye kiss.
 <br>
 Umokay, well sure.
 <br>
 Michael! Jackie! We were No, there was Wow, how ironic, huh? Eric, I just saw Michael kissing your sister.
 <br>
 Okay, hes a rat! Hes been cheating on me! What? Well, surely there must be some kind of mistake! Right, guys? Come on! Well it sure is a mind blower! So thats it! Michael and I are over! Really? And by over you mean I mean over and done! All right, forever! Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Now by forever you mean And after everything I put up with, I mean, god.
 <br>
 Him taking Pam Macy to the prom, setting my house on fire, lying about Laurie, god! To be fair, thats only the stuff you know about.
 <br>
 This is incredible.
 <br>
 My time has come! Today, I will make Jackie mine! Ai! Hey, whats wrong? I dont know! I think my guts are bursting with love! So, Fez, my mom says your appendix has to come out.
 <br>
 Man, you must be in tons of pain.
 <br>
 Wheeeeeeeeeee! Cheese puffs out, pain pills in.
 <br>
 Fez loves his pills.
 <br>
 Boy, I wish there was a pill I could take.
 <br>
 Get rid of my pain.
 <br>
 Forget about Jackie pill.
 <br>
 Hell, if they made that pill, Id take it.
 <br>
 Kelso man, this is what you get for trying to do the right thing.
 <br>
 Want to know a secret? Im not wearing anything under my dress.
 <br>
 Look! Whoa! Put that away! Yeah, man, it just sucks when you try to do the right thing.
 <br>
 And then she yells at you for killing her cat.
 <br>
 Eric, you dont know how lucky you are.
 <br>
 Id give anything to be able to tell Jackie I killed her cat.
 <br>
 Nothings sadder than when two people break up.
 <br>
 Except this time when its funny! By the way, Eric, if your mom ever says, ready for your catheter, the answer is no.
 <br>
 Donna, were supposed to be friends.
 <br>
 Would it have killed you to say, I know you love him, but Michaels a jerk? Jackie, I think my exact words were, I know you love him, but Michaels a jerk.
 <br>
 Sohave you seen Kelso since No.
 <br>
 Hes a liar, and a cheater.
 <br>
 Maybe thats how all guys are.
 <br>
 I know how you feel.
 <br>
 Like, its bad enough what Eric did to Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers, then he lied to me.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Eric put off telling you something because he didnt wanna hurt you.
 <br>
 Whoo! That is so much worse that cheating on you with another woman.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 No its not! Oh.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I guess Eric was just trying to be nice.
 <br>
 Maybe Im overreacting.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Lemme tell you something, Donna.
 <br>
 Until goody-goody Eric cheats on you with your stupid dead cat, I suggest you shut up.
 <br>
 God, I miss Jackie.
 <br>
 I KNOW!! Well, youre in luck, Fez! The bars closed early today, so we found a doctor to do your surgery! Oh, good.
 <br>
 I see theyve already shaved you.
 <br>
 Actually, I did that myself.
 <br>
 Lucky coincidence, huh? Okay, then.
 <br>
 Time for sleepy-sleepy.
 <br>
 Okay, now count back from one hundred.
 <br>
 One hundredninety-nine twenty-seven Fez voice over: Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy.
 <br>
 Now they were police.
 <br>
 My name is Fez.
 <br>
 Stand back.
 <br>
 And remember, girls, this ones for Fez.
 <br>
 This is your unlucky day now that Fezs angels are here.
 <br>
 Dont move.
 <br>
 Im gonna blow up Fez headquarters.
 <br>
 I cant bear to see any of you with such ahandsome foreign sex machine.
 <br>
 This is gonna be a blast.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Youre a real barrel of laughs.
 <br>
 Congratulations on a job well done, angels.
 <br>
 The girls: Thank you, Fez.
 <br>
 Are we going to see you soon? No, I cant get away.
 <br>
 Im in a little hot water right now.
 <br>
 Fez, Fez, honey! Oh, thank god you pulled through.
 <br>
 I was afraid youd die before I got to tell you.
 <br>
 I love you! No, no, Jackie.
 <br>
 No sex now.
 <br>
 We must wait.
 <br>
 Until were married? No.
 <br>
 Until the catheter comes out.
 <br>
 Fez? Fez? Fez? Fez? I told you! No sex now! Hey there, Midge.
 <br>
 Kitty, uh, insisted I bring this over to show our sorrow because of your loss.
 <br>
 Aw, thanks, Red.
 <br>
 We were all sitting around reminiscing about our dear departed cat.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers J.
 <br>
 Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Do you have a story you wanna share, Red? Wed sure appreciate it.
 <br>
 Seeing as how your son killed him.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well I remember he used to come into my yard, and uh and uhyou know, Id uhthrow a bucket at him or spray him with the hose.
 <br>
 And hed run away.
 <br>
 Then hed come back.
 <br>
 Id do it again! I guess youyou could say we kinda had our own thing.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Okay, enjoy the casserole.
 <br>
 We set up a Mr.
 <br>
 Bonkers memorial slide show in the other room.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Uh, that casserole theres a seven layer.
 <br>
 Of course, uh, two of those layers  are peas and I really should have told you right away about your cat, but its a pretty good casserole, theres ham in it.
 <br>
 Look, Eric, I know you didnt wanna hurt me, and I understand that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s justweve gotta be honest with each other.
 <br>
 I mean, especially now that weveyou know.
 <br>
 Weveyou know! Cause, I just dont wanna end up like Jackie and Kelso.
 <br>
 No, no, I dont think were gonna end up like Jackie and Kelso.
 <br>
 I mean, I lie out of the goodness of my heart.
 <br>
 Its still a lie, Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah, youre right.
 <br>
 Im sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 About everything.
 <br>
 All right, well, from now on, no more secrets.
 <br>
 Oh, god, then I guess Im gonna have to come clean.
 <br>
 Okay, in first grade, behind your back, I used to call you Donna Pinch-my-buttie.
 <br>
 Well, you know Eric, thats okay.
 <br>
 Cause I was the first one to call you Eric Foreskin.
 <br>
 You started that? Thats not funny.
 <br>
 That one stuck.
 <br>
 Oh, shut up Foreskin! So, really, breaking up with Michael could be the start of something great.
 <br>
 I am a whole new Jackie.
 <br>
 Really? Cause youre babbling like the old Jackie.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Ive been looking for you.
 <br>
 Here I am.
 <br>
 Okay, so you two probably wanna be alone.
 <br>
 No, Forman! How can this not be good? Come on.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Jackie, Ive done some terrible and stupid things.
 <br>
 Too many to even list.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, give it a shot, man.
 <br>
 Ill fill in the blanks.
 <br>
 Hyde! All right.
 <br>
 But Im done making excuses.
 <br>
 And all I can say is is that Im sorry.
 <br>
 And I love you.
 <br>
 And I will do whatever I can, every day from now on so that you know thats true.
 <br>
 So will you pleaseplease please take me back? Oh, Michael.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, you know what? Were through.
 <br>
 Forever.
 <br>
 Whoa, didnt see that coming.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 So, umthat, that, that was the smartest thing Ive ever done.
 <br>
 And, umand the best.
 <br>
 Hyde! Why does she always come to me?
 <br>
