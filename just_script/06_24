<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Guys I have to tell you about this dream I had.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Eric, I can&#39;t hear another one of your lame dreams.
 <br>
 &#34;Guys, I dreamt I was purple and I could fly and Luke Skywalker was my lab partner.
 <br>
 &#34; No.
 <br>
 It was about Donna.
 <br>
 Okay, it was five years in the future.
 <br>
 Five years in the future? Did you see Jackie? How&#39;s she holdin&#39; up? Do I need to get out now? Hyde, in my dream, Donna gave up her life plans to be with me.
 <br>
 And she was so miserable, she left me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it ? I took my feet off the table and turned slightly to the left for that? Look, you guys, what if I really am holding Donna back.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 and she just doesn&#39;t realize it yet? I feel like I could be ruining both of our lives.
 <br>
 Eric, relax, okay? It&#39;s just a stress dream, &#39;cause you&#39;re gettin&#39; married tomorrow.
 <br>
 Now I had a dream last night that&#39;s worth telling.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna was in a wet t-shirt contest No, I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Forget it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s too dirty.
 <br>
 So who&#39;s gonna be your best man? Oh, you know what? Why don&#39;t you guys just decide who my best man is? Whoa, you want us to choose? Well, if that&#39;s not an invitation to dress a dog up in a tuxedo, I don&#39;t know what it is.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 If anyone should be the best man, it&#39;s me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be a father, so I really need the money.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t get paid to be the best man.
 <br>
 You do it for the satisfaction of nailing the hottest bridesmaid.
 <br>
 It&#39;s in the bible.
 <br>
 Well, I can&#39;t do that, &#39;cause I&#39;m bringin&#39; Brooke.
 <br>
 Yeah, we&#39;re getting pretty serious.
 <br>
 Girls, man.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you get &#39;em pregnant, they get all clingy.
 <br>
 hey, on earth, green means go! Gosh, I didn&#39;t know they let brain-dead morons drive cars.
 <br>
 And I didn&#39;t know they let brain-dead morons into the Police Academy.
 <br>
 Oh, they do! Brooke? Hi, Michael.
 <br>
 This is my mother.
 <br>
 Yeah, we.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 we met.
 <br>
 It didn&#39;t go very well.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 6 - Episode 2q &#34;Going Mobile&#34; Here she is.
 <br>
 Welcome, or as I like to say, happy trailers to you.
 <br>
 A trailer.
 <br>
 Well, son, you finally made it.
 <br>
 Well, and.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 and.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 and just look at all the nature.
 <br>
 I mean, right in your front yard, you have a beautiful apple core.
 <br>
 Donna don&#39;t take offense, but a trailer? I think you could do better.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 I was just thinking so could my dad.
 <br>
 Hey, watch it, Donna.
 <br>
 She&#39;s wrong, Pammy.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t do better than you.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve tried and failed on several occasions.
 <br>
 Oh, bobby.
 <br>
 Oh, I think I hear a chicken.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be in the car.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go with you.
 <br>
 We&#39;re in the honeymoon stage where she doesn&#39;t mind if I get handsy.
 <br>
 Well, I think this place is great.
 <br>
 You can just drive your car right up to it, and then you have a walk-in closet.
 <br>
 And look at our teeny, tiny bathroom.
 <br>
 Eric, can I talk to you privately in the living roo.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 the, uh, dining .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 the left front quadrant? Son living here is a real bad idea.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no privacy.
 <br>
 Where will you hide if Donna has a chore for you? You&#39;ll have to dive under the trailer.
 <br>
 Honey, would you help me unload some groceries from the car? See what I mean? I&#39;m cornered, like an animal.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Coming, honey.
 <br>
 Your life is gonna be a living hell.
 <br>
 So home sweet home.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, um hey Um, don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but is this really what we want? What? Of course it is.
 <br>
 Why? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I just you know, it&#39;s such a big step.
 <br>
 And, I just really want to make sure this is what we want, what you want.
 <br>
 Eric, the life I want is with you.
 <br>
 I love you.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know, but.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 wait a minute.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t about this place.
 <br>
 This is about me.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Are you having doubts about me? Because if you are, tell me now.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t wait, like, ten years from now when we&#39;re both too fat to get dates.
 <br>
 No, no, no, forget it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy, happy, happy, happy.
 <br>
 Okay, now you&#39;re saying &#34;happy&#34; way too much.
 <br>
 Uh, because I&#39;m very happy.
 <br>
 If I were less happy, I&#39;d say it less.
 <br>
 I think that&#39;s how language works, Donna.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go pump out the toilet.
 <br>
 So Forman nixed our best man idea.
 <br>
 Apparently you wearing a giant trench coat and standing on my shoulders isn&#39;t classy.
 <br>
 Not classy? Did you tell him I&#39;ll be wearing a plastic flower that sprays water? So let&#39;s just do rock, paper, scissors to see who the best man is, all right? No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 I hate that game.
 <br>
 I always lose.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you always pick rock.
 <br>
 That&#39;s because nothing beats rock.
 <br>
 Paper beats rock.
 <br>
 Those are the rules.
 <br>
 Eh, not buying it.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll play a new game.
 <br>
 How about cockroach, foot, nuclear bomb? Foot squashes cockroach.
 <br>
 Nuclear bomb blows up foot.
 <br>
 And cockroach survives nuclear bomb.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be nuclear bomb.
 <br>
 Nothing beats nuclear bomb.
 <br>
 I just told you, cockroach beats nuclear bomb.
 <br>
 Oh, we&#39;ll see about that.
 <br>
 Laurie, it&#39;s bad luck for the groom to see the bride in a wedding dress.
 <br>
 Make sure Eric doesn&#39;t come in.
 <br>
 What, you want Laurie to guard the door? She&#39;s never kept a man out of anywhere in her entire life.
 <br>
 That is not true.
 <br>
 Jackie, watch the door.
 <br>
 So Donna, rehearsal dinner tonight, wedding tomorrow, you excited? Um, actually, I&#39;m a little nervous.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s just cold feet.
 <br>
 Yeah, but here&#39;s the thing-- whenever anyone&#39;s nervous about marriage, everyone says it&#39;s just cold feet.
 <br>
 But half of all marriage send in divorce, so half of those people getting married should have cold feet.
 <br>
 But by the time they realize their feet were right, it&#39;s too late.
 <br>
 Too late! How do I know what to do? There is no answer! I can&#39;t breathe.
 <br>
 How you feel is totally normal.
 <br>
 A lot of the guys that I&#39;m dating were nervous before their weddings, but now they&#39;re all happily married.
 <br>
 You do make a mother proud.
 <br>
 Ready? One, two, three.
 <br>
 Cockroach beats nuclear bomb.
 <br>
 That is 38 wins in a row.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s safe to say that I&#39;m the best man.
 <br>
 No, wait a minute.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 I just noticed something.
 <br>
 Cockroach always wins.
 <br>
 One more time, for all the marbles.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 One, two, three.
 <br>
 Foot, I forgot about foot.
 <br>
 So foot always wins.
 <br>
 One more time.
 <br>
 Winner, best man, period.
 <br>
 One, two, three.
 <br>
 Bomb?! Nuclear bomb beat foot.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like everything in this game loses to something else! Yes, it&#39;s exactly like that.
 <br>
 Wait, except aha.
 <br>
 I was so blind.
 <br>
 Nuclear bomb beats everything.
 <br>
 One more time, winner take all.
 <br>
 One, two, three.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going home.
 <br>
 Boy, wish I had a dollar for every awkward lunch I&#39;ve had with my mom and a strange guy that knocked me up.
 <br>
 come on, guys, we have to get past this.
 <br>
 - The baby&#39;s coming in a month.
 <br>
 - Oh, and Michael&#39;s willing to wait that long.
 <br>
 I&#39;m surprised he doesn&#39;t just honk his horn and try to scare it out in a week.
 <br>
 Hey, if I wanted to scare a baby, I wouldn&#39;t honk.
 <br>
 I&#39;d wear a mask and make ghost sounds.
 <br>
 You were still rude.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s common courtesy to wait Pass the rolls, please.
 <br>
 Pass the rolls, please.
 <br>
 I will, but I feel it&#39;s common courtesy to wait 30 seconds before passing the rolls.
 <br>
 Hey, I just remembered there&#39;s another room here.
 <br>
 So, Michael, I haven&#39;t told Brooke yet, but I&#39;m here to take her home to Chicago to have the baby and live with me.
 <br>
 What? No, but I&#39;m not in Chicago.
 <br>
 That&#39;s its major attraction.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah? Well, what about the lake? Jackie, do you think Eric and I are making a mistake? You are.
 <br>
 But Eric&#39;s just praying this whole thing goes through before you notice.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 Up until now, everything in our relationship has been really great.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 our first date, our first kiss, even getting engaged.
 <br>
 But now, in the pit of my stomach, I feel really sick.
 <br>
 Come on, Donna, you and Eric are meant to be together.
 <br>
 You&#39;re like a fat girl and a cat.
 <br>
 It just works, you know? Oh, come on.
 <br>
 All right, look, I&#39;m gonna go pick up my dress.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna try not to look prettier than you, but I can&#39;t promise.
 <br>
 Oh, god, I can&#39;t do this.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s get a picture of the wedding party.
 <br>
 Oh, mom, would you fix your top? This isn&#39;t &#34;playboy.
 <br>
 &#34; She&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t fuss with her.
 <br>
 Kitty, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but at a wedding rehearsal, isn&#39;t it tradition for the bride and groom to.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 well, you know, show up? Red, they will show up.
 <br>
 Everything is just fine.
 <br>
 Eric better have a good reason for being late.
 <br>
 There&#39;s only two acceptable excuses for tardiness in a Pinciotti household.
 <br>
 One.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 traffic was terrible.
 <br>
 Two.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I should have left earlier, but I was doin&#39; somethin&#39;.
 <br>
 Well, Donna&#39;s not here either.
 <br>
 Oh, maybe her new house ran out of gas.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 Oh, good, They&#39;re here.
 <br>
 I told you everything would be fine.
 <br>
 Eric and Donna are here.
 <br>
 What? No, Eric&#39;s not with me.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not here ? Oh, maybe he&#39;s stuck in traffic.
 <br>
 What traffic? 90% of this town&#39;s population is in this room.
 <br>
 Look, you can&#39;t take Brooke to Chicago.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna raise our baby together here, - Okay? We had it all figured out.
 <br>
 - Oh, really? So where were you going to live? Are you planning to get married? And who&#39;s gonna stay home with the baby? No, tha.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 we figured out other stuff, like she&#39;s gonna be the one that does the breast-feeding.
 <br>
 And then if someone needs to go bowling, I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 Now I appreciate your concern, but I&#39;m gonna do what&#39;s best for my kid.
 <br>
 Well, then think, Michael.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going away to the Police Academy for the next six months.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have the time to help Brooke raise a baby.
 <br>
 I do, and I have a house and a backyard and an extra bedroom, and I love Brooke more than anything in the world.
 <br>
 How can that not be what&#39;s best for her? So, um how&#39;s the big argument going? All right, Brooke, um your mom and I thought that, um maybe since I&#39;m gonna be at Police Academy, that you might wanna have the baby in Chicago.
 <br>
 You know, just so you have your mom there.
 <br>
 Just for now.
 <br>
 Oh, my god, Michael.
 <br>
 Thank you so much.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll come visit, and it&#39;ll be great.
 <br>
 What do you know? You&#39;re a gentleman.
 <br>
 And your daughter&#39;s a lady, all except for the bathroom sex that resulted in our child.
 <br>
 Kitty, Eric is over two hours late.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go home.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not late, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 He didn&#39;t show up because he doesn&#39;t want to marry me.
 <br>
 Hey, you don&#39;t know that.
 <br>
 Maybe he&#39;s just playing hard to get.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna make him pay for this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not strong, but I know a lot of ways to destroy men emotionally.
 <br>
 I can vouch for that.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 let&#39;s turn those frowns upside down.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll all go back to my house and enjoy the Mexican fiesta I prepared.
 <br>
 I probably won&#39;t serve the tiny wedding cakes, since nobody&#39;s getting married.
 <br>
 But there are three kinds of burritos.
 <br>
 Donna, in troubled times like this, I have a friend I like to turn to.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 gooseberry gloss lipstick.
 <br>
 Nobody can feel sad with full, juicy, red lips.
 <br>
 Okay, no offense,but I don&#39;t think your lipstick is gonna help me, because I am not a superficial jerk! Better.
 <br>
 How could Eric do this to me? I mean, what kind of a horrible person skips out on someone they&#39;ve known their whole life? I mean, someone they&#39;re supposed to love? Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Um, Donna, why is your suitcase in the backseat? Huh? Oh, I was just.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I thought may.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Hey, I showed up, okay?! what the hell are we gonna do with all these bride and groom cookies? Give me the groom.
 <br>
 Well, did you find Eric? No, and the Cruiser&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 I also noticed that he took his retainer.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s probably gonna be an overnighter.
 <br>
 And I couldn&#39;t find him either.
 <br>
 I followed a trail of candy wrappers, and it just circled back around to me.
 <br>
 Donna, I know how difficult this is for you.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;ve been with a lot of men in my life.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 rich men, poor men.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 well, not poor, upper middle-class.
 <br>
 My point is, none of them ever loved me the way I know Eric loves you.
 <br>
 Well, thanks, Pamela, but if Eric loved me, he&#39;d be here right now.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, kitty, listen, I think I&#39;m just gonna take Donna home and call it a night.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t you dare.
 <br>
 We need to act like everything is normal.
 <br>
 Keep the party going.
 <br>
 Keep Donna happy.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you have a speech to give? - Kitty, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s still appropriate.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - Okay, bob&#39;s got a speech.
 <br>
 Everybody, listen to Bob&#39;s speech.
 <br>
 Speech! Speech! I guess I could change a few things as I go along.
 <br>
 &#34;To the lovely bride and the handsome bride&#34; &#34;I know that one of you will make yourself very happy.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Your life will surely be enriched by all the time you spend with .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 alone.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 &#34;You are truly one soul becoming one joined alone forever.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;So I don&#39;t look at this as the day I lose a daughter.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;I look at this as the day I gain .
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 nobody.
 <br>
 &#34; Salut.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 Yeah, we kinda figured.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Well, do you wanna talk to her? She sittin&#39; right here.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Wrong number.
 <br>
 Hyde, what did he say? - He said he&#39;s really sorry.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s sorry? He left me the day before our wedding, and he&#39;s sorry? What.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 what does that mean? It means he&#39;s not coming.
 <br>
 Not tonight, not to the wedding.
 <br>
 He&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 Man, I am glad to be here.
 <br>
 I have had a rough day.
 <br>
 Being around all this love and happiness oughta cheer me right up.
 <br>
 I mean, this is a happy day.
 <br>
 Look at all the love.
 <br>
 Wait, hey, where&#39;s Eric? I can&#39;t believe Forman took off, man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not like him at all.
 <br>
 Usually he ruins things by staying.
 <br>
 - So, steven, you know, since the church is booked already, you think maybe we - No!         - Oh, come on! Look, Eric jilts Donna and all you guys can talk about is yourselves.
 <br>
 Well, there are bigger issues here, people.
 <br>
 Donna is single.
 <br>
 Whoo-hoo! Wait a minute.
 <br>
 I get it now.
 <br>
 Cockroach beats everything.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s play, and I warn you, I&#39;m going to be cockroach.
 <br>
