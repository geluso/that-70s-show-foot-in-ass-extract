Yeah, Im not doing that Okay, then let me tell you about the first time I ate a blow pop Lick number one: What a surprise! You are forgetting the whale songs?

Oh, great, Dad, you know what? You woke him up, you put him back to sleep! Hey! UhIts been pointed out to me that Ive been acting a little flaky about, um our situation I disagree, flakey means your not consistent, you run away every time you see me Anyway, I think we should talk about what were gonna do or Im sure your gonna want me to meet your parents and lucky for you I look good in a suit I look good in anything, But you already know that, so Actually, dont worry about it! as far as the baby and I are concerned your off the hook So your just letting me go? Yep, you dont have to think about this ever again And I wont! WOW! Your like the coolest girl I ever did it with at a concert! Oh, honey, you look terrible Oh, you dont look so hot yourself, sister I beg your pardon Red made me sleep in the basement and every time I started to fall asleep Hyde would put a popsicle on my neck Thats my daddys chair &#34;Thats my daddys chair&#34; Fez, look, man you gotta start kissing Reds butt a little or hes gonna make sure you get deported He should be kissing my butt for taking his trashy daughter off his hands Im not that trashy, I wont sleep with you Oh, zip it, jezebel Out of my chair, Tonto Oh, come on a chair is a chair, branch out a little try the piano bench What did you say?! - Laurie, go get a cup of milk - Why? Itll keep Fezs teeth alive until we get him to the dentist Hi, sir, Hal Armstrong from the immigration service, Im here to conduct some interviews What do you want to know, cause Ill tell you everything Is it-Is it to late to give you back your chair Oh, no dont get up this could be the last time you sit on furniture that you didnt build out of mud and twigs So, Agent Armstrong cant wait to tell you all about this marriage, you got handcuffs, right? Red, Red, why dont you help me in the kitchen, Laurie make our guest comfortable Hey, G-man Okay, Red, just because he sat in your chair is no reason to get the boy deported You dont like me because Im not from here This has nothing to do with you being a foreigner.
 <br>
 Its about you taking advantage of my daughter like a sneaky foreigner Oh, wait, dad, look, I stayed home from college to take care of you and mom in your hour of need, okay you owe me! That is just like a woman to bring that up You know, Laurie could get in a lot of trouble, too - What kinda trouble? - Big trouble, dad, she could go to jail or back to jail! Well, come on, Its like where has she been for the past two years All right, fine, I wont volunteer anything but if he asks me a direct question Im not lying - Oh, you wont have to.
 <br>
 Ill do all the talking for you - Well, youll be good at that! And I guess it might be fun to just sit back and watch Tarzan here crumble before the full force of the U.
 <br>
 S Government Okay, thats it.
 <br>
 Anwar I can deal with.
 <br>
 Tonto, in the ballpark, but TarzanTarzan is a white guy Dont sass me, Tarzan! Michael, there is no way Brooke said your off the hook, Okay, I bet she said Im gonna take every penny you have you irresponsible bastard because thats what I would say No, she definitely said Off the hook Man I am one tall, cute, lucky kid! So thats it, man? Its like this thing with You and Brooke never happened Yeahwell no, I mean, theres still gonna be a baby out there but my lifes back to normal sort a I mean, its kinda weird but Im not gonna think about it cause I dont need to you know I should be happy right now.
 <br>
 You know, I am happy, right now! Yeah, I think Yeah, think, feel, look deep inside like deep, deep inside almost to China Theres a good guy in there You know what? Dont lecture me, okay? I went to her and I tried to talk to her and she said it was cool which is awesome because this could, like, screw up my whole life! Yeah, man, you know you gotta stay focused if your gonna invent those quadruple Oreos Those are a secret, man No yeah, this is good.
 <br>
 Why put yourself out for some kid, children grow up without dads all the time - Right - Yeah, like Steven Well, I dont want him ending up like Hyde hair all frizzed out with angry thoughts And violent, too Kelso, you know what you should do? But you&#39;re not gonna do it because your to much of a tool You know what? Its real easy to talk about the right thing to do when its not your life Tool Oh, Steven your sensitive to this because your father ditched you, too That is so foxy Hey, why dont we go down to my room, tell you about the time my mom got so loaded on mouthwash, she lost our rent money at the track Okay, you two claim to be married and living here to verify this Im going to separate you all and ask you a series of questions about the couple.
 <br>
 - Let me remind you your all under oath - under oath? I mean under Oath, bravo! Okay, first question, What kind of toothpaste does Fez use? Um, I brush my teeth with Colgate it is the only thing that cuts through the, um, milk duds - Who the hell cares about toothpaste? This kid and my daughter are - Happy, happy, happy! Iwait, w-why am I under oath? cause if I say crest and the answer is minty crest I Mean, thats, like, uh, perjury, was-whats gonna happen to me? wha-Oh, my god why are you writing this down? How long did Fez and Laurie date before they got married? Who needs to date? I had her in the sack faster than you can say Corn on The cob.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Speaking of dates, I made an incredible date nut bread The secret is to oak the dates in some good, strong rum, which reminds me, who needs a drink?I know I do.
 <br>
 I dont know how long they dated, I-oh, my God, Im going to prison arent I? Im gonna get shanked What is Fezs favorite T.
 <br>
 V show? Uh, well, it depends.
 <br>
 Basically I just flip until I see nipples Sometimes I feel like a loaf of bread, everyone keeps taking a slice of me until all thats left are two crusty pieces that nobody wants and I just want to scream Appreciate me, Damn it but I dont, why? Because my mother always told me that nice girls shouldnt make a fuss and now I am a flippin doormat Okay look, man.
 <br>
 Prison is not an option for me, okay? I cant pee in front of other people WellDespite a few interesting answers and one recipe My judgment is that your marriage is legitimate.
 <br>
 Congratulations! All right, Pepé and I are Americans No wonder this country is going in the toilet What was that, sir? Nothing, nothing he said he has to use the toilet, thats why hes been so quiet If your trying to protect your daughter, dont worry We never go after the bride especially such a pretty one If there was a crime committed, wed only be interested in this one, so if theres something you want to say, by all means, say it Fine, I will I just wanted to say these two kids are married and very much in love In fact, Ive never seen a love like this Thank you, Mr.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 It means a lot Hey, what about thanking me his guy tried to break me but lucky for you double-O Forman is rock solid Wow, you really are pregnant They make them really tiny now quarter pound, my ass Hey! I need to talk to you Kelso, thats great! Here take my seat sit down Ill just be right over there Good for you! All rightAt first when you told me I was off the hook.
 <br>
 I was, like, totally psyched, right? But then I started to think about it and - I dont wanna be off the hook, I wanna be a part of this kids life - Michael, I didnt let you off the hook to be nice.
 <br>
 I just dont think you understand what I means to have a baby No but I doI means, taking him to teeball games, and teaching him how to ride a bike and taking him to the doctor when hes sick And what if its a girl? Uh, its not gonna be a girl we did it standing up! Uh-huh Okay, maybe this will change your mind I went and got some stuff today, this little sweater, to keep him warm andthis little hat, to keep the sun off of his face I got some pop rocks cause I always wanted to see a baby eat popRocks Michael, If you get involved, Im just gonna have two babies to take care of instead of one Look, you can try to get rid of me but Im not walkin away from this Im sorry, I just dont want you to be the father of my child This is all your fault, yeah! -  Go talk to her an-and-and do the right thing - Kelso, Im so sorry, I wish there was something I could do Well, there isnt Okay fine Ill give you ten seconds to squeeze my ass as long as you want I never thought Id say this but theres some things that a girls ass can&#39;t fix Well, Fez, congratulations on your green card, but remember this is America and you still look foreign so dont expect to be treated equally Well, Im going to become Americas sexiest singing cowboy Howdy ladies, meet Pepé! You know, whats going on with Brooke really hurts but I think in a couple days when I start to heel, Im gonna be really psyched that Donna let me squeeze her ass.
 <br>
 I mean, even now Im reflecting upon on how soft it was So, what kind of chance do you think I have with the blonde?
