<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Well, how are you the morning? Well, my baby boy&#39;s still engaged.
 <br>
 My hot flashes are back, so I feel like I&#39;m standing in a pool of burning lava.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t make a pill for menopause, so I took a Flintstone vitamin.
 <br>
 And when you take a pill shaped like Barney Rubble it&#39;s pretty obvious the freakin&#39; thing ain&#39;t gonna work! Great.
 <br>
 Anyway, about the engagement I&#39;ve got Eric and Donna on the ropes.
 <br>
 I dared them to get married next week.
 <br>
 They were shaking like France.
 <br>
 Well, I know you like scaring children, but what&#39;s the point? Well, the point is if we let them do what they want they&#39;ll realize they don&#39;t wanna do it.
 <br>
 I mean, hell, nobody wants to be married.
 <br>
 Except me to you.
 <br>
 I&#39;d do that all over again.
 <br>
 Oh, is Steven here? He saw me on the couch with Michael, but there was nothing going on.
 <br>
 God, what do I do if he doesn&#39;t believe me, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman? - When in the hell did this start? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 The kids all used to run from me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the way I liked it.
 <br>
 - [Whines] - Well, next fall, you&#39;ll get your wish.
 <br>
 Eric will be in college, and then the whole house will be empty.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 We&#39;re only one good-bye away from heaven.
 <br>
 Mommy, Daddy, I&#39;m home! We gotta start lockin&#39; that door.
 <br>
 [Door Opens] - [Door Closes] - No way! ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] - Donna.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 If you had bad news that could hurt someone that you cared about, what would you do? Kelso, just leave the poor girl an anonymous note and tell her she needs a shot of penicillin.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Someone I know cheated on someone else I know.
 <br>
 Did Eric cheat on me? I will snap that little monkey like a twig! But no! Donna.
 <br>
 God, Eric didn&#39;t cheat on you.
 <br>
 - Hyde cheated on Jackie.
 <br>
 - What? Oh, my God! [High-pitched] Yeah! And he doesn&#39;t know it, but I saw him kissing this lady in the hotel.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That is horrible.
 <br>
 - I wanna do the right thing, right? So I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;ll just tellJackie.
 <br>
 And then she&#39;ll feel really bad, and I&#39;ll console her and presto! We&#39;ll be making out topless.
 <br>
 No, Kelso.
 <br>
 The thing to do is to tell Hyde that you know and then give him a chance to tellJackie.
 <br>
 I knew you&#39;d say that.
 <br>
 You know, just once I want the right thing and the topless thing to be the same thing.
 <br>
 Well, if it isn&#39;t the lovebirds.
 <br>
 So, lovebirds, how are the big wedding plans coming along? Well, I&#39;ve decided to be the groom and, uh, Donna&#39;s gonna go with bride.
 <br>
 Well, your mom and I have made some plans too.
 <br>
 We figure since we&#39;re already giving you a graduation party why not make it a wedding party too? Wait, graduation? - That&#39;s in a week, which is like- - Seven days.
 <br>
 - I know how long a week is.
 <br>
 - I know you know.
 <br>
 Well, what&#39;s the matter? You two lovebirds still wanna get married, don&#39;t you? I mean, heck, it&#39;d be a real shame if you chickened out.
 <br>
 Then you&#39;d be a couple of love chickens.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, we wanna get married.
 <br>
 Right, Donna? Of course.
 <br>
 I do.
 <br>
 Well, then it&#39;s settled.
 <br>
 We&#39;re having a wedding.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Oh, Donna, you can wear my wedding dress.
 <br>
 It&#39;s off-white, so nobody will whisper.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 What is going on with them anyway? Eric, if you need any help dealing with Mom and Dad I&#39;m here for you.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 No, thanks.
 <br>
 Last time I trusted you, I wound up in the dryer with a pillowcase full of bees, so- I know, and I am so sorry.
 <br>
 I have been cruel to you, Eric.
 <br>
 You too, Donna, but it wasn&#39;t as obvious because I mostly said stuff behind your back.
 <br>
 Right back at ya.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not just home for a visit.
 <br>
 I am here to correct the mistakes that I have made in the past.
 <br>
 Okay, but I&#39;m sure whatever bastard children you&#39;ve had have been adopted by now.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Good luck to you.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here to get my license.
 <br>
 Oh, hello, Mitch.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here to tell you that you will get nothing! Okay, I know we had our problems in wood shop but for the hundredth time, I&#39;m sorry I sat on your spice rack.
 <br>
 You&#39;re sorry? You should see my kitchen.
 <br>
 There&#39;s spices everywhere.
 <br>
 It&#39;s anarchy.
 <br>
 Dude, you&#39;re getting hysterical like a woman.
 <br>
 Well, if you mean that I am artistic and sensitive and cry every time that I watch Love Story, then, yes, I am like a woman.
 <br>
 Now begone! You know, I could make it worth your while if you would just give me the license.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the editor of the school paper.
 <br>
 Can you imagine this headline? &#34;Foreign Kid Actually Cool.
 <br>
 &#34; &#39;Course, I&#39;d have to retract it the next day, because-Well, come on.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a headline for you: &#34;Short Kid Takes Long Walk.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, hello, Hyde.
 <br>
 I saw something very interesting in the hotel this morning.
 <br>
 Oh, the guy in the dress? That&#39;s Frank.
 <br>
 Comes in twice a month.
 <br>
 Gets really pissed if you don&#39;t call him Lady Laguna.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I saw you kissing a girl that wasn&#39;tJackie.
 <br>
 - Oh, that.
 <br>
 - Ah, so you admit it.
 <br>
 - Sure.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t try to deny it.
 <br>
 - I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re not gonna wiggle your way outta this one! I&#39;m not trying to.
 <br>
 Look, I cheated on Jackie, &#39;cause she cheated on me with you.
 <br>
 Which reminds me, I oughta kick your ass.
 <br>
 Well, Hyde, we weren&#39;t doing anything.
 <br>
 I already told you.
 <br>
 Jackie was comforting me, &#39;cause I was upset, &#39;cause Fez had a sex dream about me.
 <br>
 Would you shut up about that lame-ass story? Well, it&#39;s the truth, and I&#39;ll prove it.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go ask Fez.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 - You drive.
 <br>
 My van&#39;s in the shop.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 I need gas though.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Can I borrow money for fries? - No.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Shotgun.
 <br>
 - There&#39;s only two of us, you moron.
 <br>
 - Fine! You know what I think, Donna? I think this whole &#34;get married in a week&#34; stuff is just Red trying to get us to call the whole thing off.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 But you know what? That ain&#39;t happening, missy.
 <br>
 You know what we&#39;re gonna do? We&#39;re gonna teach Red a lesson and get married out of spite.
 <br>
 Yeah, screw you, Red! Wow.
 <br>
 It&#39;s every little girl&#39;s dream to get married out of spite.
 <br>
 You know what? I think maybe you&#39;re not ready to get married.
 <br>
 And if you&#39;re not, you better tell me right now.
 <br>
 Donna, I&#39;m not ready.
 <br>
 - Oh, thank God.
 <br>
 Me neither.
 <br>
 - What? - I thought you were ready.
 <br>
 - I thought you were.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 - Me neither.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God, you are so hot.
 <br>
 - You are! Wow, nothing hits the spot after an hour and a half of passion like chili cheese fries.
 <br>
 Oh, hello, Mitch.
 <br>
 Had a nice walk over here? Get used to it because you&#39;ll never get a license.
 <br>
 - Do you understand me? - No, but nobody understands you.
 <br>
 You talk like Mushmouth from Fat Albert.
 <br>
 You just dug your own grave, fella.
 <br>
 &#34;I flug my own rave, bella&#34;? Was that what you said, Mushmouth? All right, Fez.
 <br>
 I need you to tell Hyde about the dream you had about me.
 <br>
 What? I didn&#39;t have any dream.
 <br>
 [Mouths Words] We have a visitor.
 <br>
 Fez, this is really important, okay? Start talking, or so help me, I&#39;ll give you the worst purple nurple you&#39;ve ever had.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 In my dream, Kelso was dressed as a nurse and he was giving me a sponge bath.
 <br>
 And? I was nude.
 <br>
 See? I was really freaked out and Jackie and me were just talkin&#39;, that&#39;s all.
 <br>
 So I just cheated on Jackie for nothing? It&#39;s what I&#39;ve been telling you, man.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, look, okay? Whatever you think happened between me and Michael, did not happen, okay? So, everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Actually, we need to talk.
 <br>
 You know, I really hate to run but I gotta go tell the whole school about you and Nurse Ding-a-ling&#39;s sponge bath.
 <br>
 So, I gotta go.
 <br>
 - You wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - &#34;Blue blound&#39;t&#34;? Move your lips, Mushmouth! So, I was in the den, and Michael came over all upset.
 <br>
 - Jackie.
 <br>
 - And, Steven, I asked him to leave.
 <br>
 - And that&#39;s when you saw us.
 <br>
 But I swear, nothing happened.
 <br>
 - Jackie.
 <br>
 Jackie! Stop talking.
 <br>
 Look, I know all this now, okay? But before I knew, I was at the hotel last night.
 <br>
 And I was really mad.
 <br>
 There was this nurse.
 <br>
 - And- - And what? And I&#39;m really sorry, okay? I promise it&#39;ll never happen again.
 <br>
 You know, that&#39;s exactly what Michael used to say.
 <br>
 - Come on, Jackie.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 You know what, Steven? I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s over.
 <br>
 [Radio: Man Singing Country] Huh.
 <br>
 - I finally get country music.
 <br>
 - ## [Ends] Donna, look, it&#39;s my old wedding dress.
 <br>
 Oh, and you can wear it as a bib.
 <br>
 Hey, and for the reception, I got the guys back together from my high school band- the Pinciotti Polka Explosion.
 <br>
 Won&#39;t be long now until you two lovebirds are married forever.
 <br>
 No escape.
 <br>
 Until one of you is dead.
 <br>
 So, you guys, I&#39;ve been trying to think of ways to help you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Laurie? Yeah, what happened to you? You guys, living in Chicago opened my eyes.
 <br>
 I had no job, no friends.
 <br>
 I did sleep with one of the White Sox but then it just turned out to be this frat guy wearing a White Sox hat.
 <br>
 Basically, I hit rock bottom.
 <br>
 Really.
 <br>
 God, I was so sure you&#39;d be a senator.
 <br>
 Eric, love is hard to find.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ve realized I&#39;ve been taking the people who love me for granted.
 <br>
 Especially you.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t love you.
 <br>
 Yes, you do.
 <br>
 And if you two love each other, but Red is making you miserable then there&#39;s only one answer.
 <br>
 Get out.
 <br>
 Leave town.
 <br>
 Because love is precious.
 <br>
 Well, it sounds good but I can&#39;t help but remember the feeling of being stung by bees as I tumbled around and around.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Is that a tear? Oh, my God, Eric.
 <br>
 I think she&#39;s being sincere.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, it&#39;s real.
 <br>
 I have a sister.
 <br>
 Hey, look who I found.
 <br>
 At first I just thought he was a leprechaun.
 <br>
 Fez, I came over here because I wanna end this feud, okay? Right here, right now.
 <br>
 And if you&#39;re not on board, I could spread your crazy naked, homoerotic dream all over school, but- Macho as I am who would believe you? Okay, Fez.
 <br>
 Uh, can I just say as the nurse that was sponging you in your dream that I&#39;m with Mitch here on the whole &#34;not spreading it around the school&#34; thing.
 <br>
 See, your lady friend here understands.
 <br>
 Truce? Well I guess.
 <br>
 - Truce.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Peace offering.
 <br>
 Moron! Oh, this is tomorrow&#39;s school paper.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, on the front page there&#39;s a picture of me kissing Kelso by the lake.
 <br>
 Fez, why are you kissing Kelso by the lake? We caught a fish! I was excited! I kissed the fish too, but, of course, they don&#39;t show you that.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Hyde.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Fine.
 <br>
 Can I say something? I think this whole thing was a misunderstanding.
 <br>
 Hyde didn&#39;t know what was going on.
 <br>
 I know, okay? But after Michael I promised myself that I would never be with another boy who cheated on me.
 <br>
 But Hyde&#39;s so good for you.
 <br>
 Since you started dating him you&#39;ve completely stopped quoting Nancy Drew.
 <br>
 And the worst part is I still love him.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 [Clicks Tongue, Sobs] You know, normally, I wouldn&#39;t cry on your sweater because, you know, it ruins the fabric.
 <br>
 But, God, this one&#39;s just so cheap, it won&#39;t matter.
 <br>
 - What? - Nothing.
 <br>
 - Just, you know, Jackie&#39;s single now.
 <br>
 - ## [Stereo: Country] Yeah, so? So, when you were going out with her, I backed off.
 <br>
 You backed off? You constantly hit on her.
 <br>
 You bought her presents all the time.
 <br>
 You shot me with a BB gun.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s me backin&#39; off.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Look, Hyde.
 <br>
 I know you thought I only wanted her because you had her.
 <br>
 See, the thing is, is now you don&#39;t have her and I still want her.
 <br>
 So, as your friend, I&#39;m just letting you know that I&#39;m going after her.
 <br>
 And also, I&#39;ll be making out with her in front of you.
 <br>
 You know, just to rub it in.
 <br>
 So, be ready for that.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Yep, that&#39;s what I&#39;m countin&#39; on.
 <br>
 While I&#39;m out getting Jackie back, you&#39;re gonna sit around here saying, &#34;Whatever.
 <br>
 &#34;  [Continues] Are you listening to country music, man? Whatever.
 <br>
 Look, Mom, Dad, Donna and I have something we wanna say.
 <br>
 Um, it turns out we&#39;re not ready to get married.
 <br>
 No! And I was really rootin&#39; for you two crazy kids.
 <br>
 Look, we know you&#39;ve been pressuring us into marriage so we&#39;d admit you were right and live on your terms.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s just not gonna happen.
 <br>
 So, we&#39;ve decided to move away as soon as we graduate.
 <br>
 Move away? No, no, no, you can&#39;t move away yet.
 <br>
 No, we were gonna use this summer to become best friends.
 <br>
 Look, we&#39;ll be going to college in the fall anyway.
 <br>
 Instead of fighting with you guys for the next three months we&#39;re just gonna get our own place in Madison.
 <br>
 Yeah, good luck trying to control us in Madison.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, remember we agreed not to do that.
 <br>
 Remember? Okay.
 <br>
 Anyway, we&#39;re gonna have our own apartment.
 <br>
 And, honestly, I just think we&#39;ll all be a lot happier.
 <br>
 - Madison has two movie theaters.
 <br>
 - Okay, Donna, come on.
 <br>
 Oh, great plan, Red.
 <br>
 Now my baby&#39;s leaving.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still here, Mommy.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, that&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - [Door Closes] The thing is, is I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 - Yeah, you said that already.
 <br>
 - [Page Turns] Come on, Jackie.
 <br>
 I made a mistake, okay? It was a stupid one-time thing.
 <br>
 You know what, Steven? I have heard it all before.
 <br>
 From you, from Michael.
 <br>
 God, just do me a favor and leave me alone.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 I love you.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I don&#39;t love you.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your car license, motorcycle license boat license, license to operate a forklift a cut-the-line pass and a free D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Pen.
 <br>
 If you turn it over, the little car parallel parks.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 And here&#39;s the negatives of you and Kelso grabbing each other&#39;s asses.
 <br>
 Hey, we were happy because we caught a fish.
 <br>
 If they do it in football, why can&#39;t we do it in fishing? &#34;Blue bit bushball in bishing&#34;? What? Where you from, man?
 <br>
