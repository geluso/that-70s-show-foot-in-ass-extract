<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Oh, my first X-rated movie.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but that is the luckiest pizza boy ever.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ll say.
 <br>
 There&#39;s at least nine boobs in this shot alone.
 <br>
 Guys, I feel bad.
 <br>
 I mean, Jackie finally takes me back and I reward her by sneaking off to see some trashy porno babes.
 <br>
 Oh, wow! That seems like it would tickle.
 <br>
 Oh, nothing&#39;s going to happen in this scene.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just two ladies.
 <br>
 Oh, bravo, nice plot twist.
 <br>
 All right, guys, I gotta go.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t thinkJackie would like me being here.
 <br>
 And you should pick up your dress on the way out.
 <br>
 Oh, wow! Does everyone do that? Because I don&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 I just stick to two or three key moves and- God, they don&#39;t even come close to that.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, I have not done anything but even I, had I done anything, would have already done that.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Jackie, you know I love you and you know how much I&#39;ve changed, right? Yeah? Oh, what&#39;d you do? I went to a stag film.
 <br>
 But then it turned out that there weren&#39;t any stags at all.
 <br>
 It was just naked people having sex.
 <br>
 Go ahead and punish me.
 <br>
 No, Michael, I&#39;m not gonna punish you.
 <br>
 You were honest with me, and honesty should be rewarded.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not in trouble and I get a reward? - Is it a cash reward? - [Giggles] No, Michael, the reward is feeling better about yourself.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Mmm, smells good.
 <br>
 Whatcha making? Oh, a little lemon meringue and pot roast and my sister Paula is coming and seven-layer salad.
 <br>
 Ahh.
 <br>
 Seven-lay- Hey, wait a second.
 <br>
 Red, now please, be nice.
 <br>
 We haven&#39;t seen her in almost six years.
 <br>
 - Yeah, not since she got arrested.
 <br>
 - No, not arrested, detained.
 <br>
 She showed up in the backseat of a police car with lights flashing.
 <br>
 I had to tell the neighbors that she was the mayor of Cincinnati.
 <br>
 - [Horn Honks] - Oh, there she is.
 <br>
 You wait.
 <br>
 She&#39;s gonna hit me up for money like she always does.
 <br>
 - [Crash] - [Car Door OPens] That&#39;s gonna cost me.
 <br>
 - [Kitty] Oh, my God.
 <br>
 ! - Kitty! Oh, my God! Look at you! I know, I know, I&#39;m fabulous.
 <br>
 - Look, huh, at me.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re wearing stockings.
 <br>
 Red, she&#39;s wearing stockings.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, and matching shoes! Oh, come on, Red.
 <br>
 I know you&#39;re dying for a nibble.
 <br>
 Paula, you&#39;re so pink.
 <br>
 Oh, well, sure, sure.
 <br>
 I gotta match my brand-new car.
 <br>
 Go ahead, pet her.
 <br>
 Well, ooh, ooh, I wanna pet her too.
 <br>
 Why did you paint it with Pepto-Bismol? It&#39;s not Pepto-Bismol.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Luscious Blushes.
 <br>
 And only the top Kathy May salesperson gets one of these babies.
 <br>
 So you stole it from her? I have all the money that I owe you.
 <br>
 Here it is.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You have cash.
 <br>
 Red, she has cash.
 <br>
 Honey, Red, Red, Red, really, you don&#39;t have to count it.
 <br>
 Oh, well, of course.
 <br>
 You&#39;re family.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, honey, honey! Honesty&#39;s cool, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like I can do anything wrong and then ask for forgiveness, and then I&#39;m good again.
 <br>
 I mean, someone should invent a religion like that.
 <br>
 Okay, so did anyone besides me think that some of the guys in that movie were not completely average? Like, you know, they were way, way above average? Well, you don&#39;t go into that line of work when you&#39;re below average.
 <br>
 You just pray some hot, redheaded neighbor girl likes you for your personality.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? Those men were completely average.
 <br>
 In fact, I found the guy with the mustache downright puny.
 <br>
 See now, Fez, that&#39;s not honest.
 <br>
 I mean, we all know you&#39;re small in the pants.
 <br>
 What I&#39;m saying is, is from here on in, I&#39;m only telling the truth.
 <br>
 In fact, I&#39;m gonna come clean toJackie about everything.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You want honesty? I&#39;ll give you honesty.
 <br>
 We are all small in the pants.
 <br>
 Kelso, this might be your best idea ever.
 <br>
 You know what? You should make a list of all the lies you&#39;ve ever told toJackie, and I&#39;ll help you.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause all&#39;s I really want is for you to be happy.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys, honestly you don&#39;t think Donna&#39;s, you know, bored, right? &#39;Cause those guys in the movie, they didn&#39;t do the same move twice.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ve done the same move, like always.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll bet they go to a special school or something.
 <br>
 I mean, they&#39;re like doctors at doing it.
 <br>
 [Kitty] Eric, dinner.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Now I have to act normal.
 <br>
 But I get to eat, yeah! - Aunt Paula, you look great.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 And so pink.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, you&#39;re so cute.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s 20 bucks.
 <br>
 Aunt Paula is awesome! So, Paula, tell me more about the ship captain.
 <br>
 Oh, that was just a fling, you know.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you have a fianc√© the last time we saw you? Red, now there is no reason to rehash ancient history, is there? No, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 It turned out he lived on some sort of commune where everyone called him God.
 <br>
 And there were- there were guns.
 <br>
 And I really could never figure out why God would need a gun.
 <br>
 But there were some fun parties.
 <br>
 Whoo! That&#39;s hilarious! Life has gotten so much better since I moved to Indianapolis.
 <br>
 I mean, things move so much faster in the big city.
 <br>
 One day you&#39;re wondering if you&#39;ll ever find happiness and the next, you&#39;re waving the starting flag at the Indy 500.
 <br>
 - You waved the Indy flag? - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 Oh, God, you&#39;re the coolest.
 <br>
 Mom, how funny is it that while Aunt Paula was at Indy you were probably at, like, Price Mart.
 <br>
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, who wants pie? It&#39;s meringue.
 <br>
 Well, enough about me.
 <br>
 Kitty, dear, what have you been up to? Well, you know, it&#39;s funny you should ask because we have been super, super busy.
 <br>
 Oh, no, she quit her job.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not up to anything.
 <br>
 It&#39;s kind of boring.
 <br>
 So, did you meet Dick Trickle? Eric! What? He&#39;s a race car driver.
 <br>
 His name is Dick Trickle.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, listen to my voice! I&#39;m so loud! Oh, well, will you look at this? Here&#39;s me, captain of the cheerleaders.
 <br>
 &#34;Most likely to succeed.
 <br>
 &#34; &#34;Best laugh.
 <br>
 &#34; [Chuckles] Oh, here&#39;s Paula.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that on her cheek? Oh, she had a little sledding accident with her face that year.
 <br>
 - Typical.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 Things were so different then.
 <br>
 Kitty, oh! You so deserve this.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the best.
 <br>
 Oh, aren&#39;t you sweet? [Laughs] Boy, oh, boy, Chet sure is lucky.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got the keenest girl in school.
 <br>
 Oh, stop! - Congratulations, Kitty.
 <br>
 - Thanks, Paula.
 <br>
 I knew you&#39;d win.
 <br>
 You always do.
 <br>
 - No, not always.
 <br>
 - Well, I want a kiss from the queen.
 <br>
 Well, Chet, you have been an awfully loyal subject.
 <br>
 You guys, I&#39;d like you to meet my date, Marvin.
 <br>
 Marvin? Sweetie? Sweetie? Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 And now, I&#39;m a housewife and she goes on cruises with Dick Trickle.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know what she&#39;s not telling you.
 <br>
 I mean, just because she&#39;s more successful than you doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;s happy.
 <br>
 More successful? Well, it&#39;s just that she has so many- And she&#39;s- she&#39;s very- [Chuckles] Look, money.
 <br>
 I love it when you do that.
 <br>
 Good to know.
 <br>
 Good to know.
 <br>
 And how about when I do this? Geez, Eric, what the hell? Okay, okay, I&#39;ll just go back up to the ear.
 <br>
 Get away from me, you pig! Where are my pants? - Wait.
 <br>
 Wait, it was an accident.
 <br>
 - [Door OPens, Closes] Look, I have a feather.
 <br>
 He did? What the heck for? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 In like what universe is that sexy? Only one- the skinny, pervert universe.
 <br>
 It was just so strange.
 <br>
 I mean, usually he just sticks to, like, two or three key moves.
 <br>
 You know, I bet it&#39;s because of that nudie flick they saw yesterday.
 <br>
 They went to an X-rated movie? Didn&#39;t Eric tell you? No.
 <br>
 God, why would Eric go see something like that? I mean, is our sex life so boring that he has to sneak around and watch other people do it? Donna, of course it is.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 So, um, what&#39;s going on here? [Chuckles] Packing a picnic lunch for your next African safari? No, I thought I&#39;d make my strudel for the boys.
 <br>
 It feels nice having people to cook for.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Well, um- Sounds like your, uh jet-set life gets pretty lonely, huh? - Oh, no, I have lots of friends.
 <br>
 - Oh, right, right.
 <br>
 But, um, all the friends in the world don&#39;t make up for having to come home from the Bahamas to an empty house, do they? I actually enjoy my privacy.
 <br>
 Hmm, privacy.
 <br>
 Loneliness.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a fine line, isn&#39;t it? Okay, Kitty, is something wrong? Yeah, something is wrong.
 <br>
 Why are you here? Because I missed you.
 <br>
 And I wanted you to see that I&#39;m finally okay.
 <br>
 Okay or better than me? Better than you? Oh, Kitty, you&#39;re my sister and- Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m finally a success, and I wanted to come back and rub your face in it.
 <br>
 And I did, and I liked it! Well, good for you.
 <br>
 It must have been hard living in my shadow, because I was popular and you weren&#39;t.
 <br>
 And I had a life and you didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I said it.
 <br>
 You heard me.
 <br>
 You were a schlub.
 <br>
 A schlub! [Both Laughing] Oh, I am so sorry.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m sorry too.
 <br>
 Oh, I just- I don&#39;t know what is the matter with me.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 - I should be just thrilled that you&#39;re finally on your feet, and instead, I&#39;m just- I&#39;m acting like a jealous little ninny.
 <br>
 Kitty, would you like a makeover? Oh, I really would.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 [Laughs] L-I won&#39;t look like a whore, will I? No, no, I promise.
 <br>
 Okay, Jackie.
 <br>
 There are some things I haven&#39;t been honest about that I feel like you should know.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Why are they here? Well, Hyde helpfully pointed out that it&#39;s not really honesty unless your friends are allowed to watch.
 <br>
 So, anyway, I made a list.
 <br>
 The list was my idea.
 <br>
 Thank you for that, Hyde.
 <br>
 Okay, so let&#39;s just get started.
 <br>
 Um, that picture you saw of me in kindergarten? Those weren&#39;t puffy pants.
 <br>
 It was a big boy diaper.
 <br>
 And that time you came out of the shower, and you thought you saw a flash? I did take your picture.
 <br>
 This one time you asked me if you had anything in your teeth? And you did, but I said no, &#39;cause it&#39;s funnier that way.
 <br>
 When we were about to fool around, and I said that I washed my hands? But really I just got done playing with like six dogs.
 <br>
 - But that&#39;s not as bad- - All right, Michael, stop! Okay, Michael, I think we need to work on selective honesty.
 <br>
 Yes, that and basic hygiene.
 <br>
 Seriously, good God, man.
 <br>
 Okay, Michael unless one of your secrets involves kissing a girl, I don&#39;t need to know about it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Oh, science fact.
 <br>
 Dogs are cleaner than humans.
 <br>
 Oh, you poor pink bastard.
 <br>
 Well, well.
 <br>
 ! What have we here? All right.
 <br>
 I got 20 minutes till my wife comes back so, uh, pucker up.
 <br>
 Okay, you two lovebirds.
 <br>
 I&#39;m off.
 <br>
 Oh, bye-bye, Red.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh, Paula, thank you so much.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, Kitty.
 <br>
 What are sisters for, huh? I&#39;ll talk to you in a couple of days.
 <br>
 And you remember what I said.
 <br>
 [Speaking French] Oui, oui, ma soeur.
 <br>
 [Door OPens, Closes, Engine Starts] - [Honks Horn] - So what&#39;s with all the French? - Did she call me something? - No.
 <br>
 She said, &#34;Search for life to live life,&#34; which is my new motto.
 <br>
 Paula made me see that I have been in a rut.
 <br>
 But the good news is, from now on, I am just going to explore life.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re- You&#39;re all pretty now with your big red lips.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that enough? Oh, I love you, Red Forman.
 <br>
 And no.
 <br>
 All right, fine.
 <br>
 But if you paint my car pink, it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, I was just looking at- Hey! Okay, where did you get the idea to do what you did? I went to see this movie and it was a- Well, I guess you could call it an art film.
 <br>
 - Eric! - Okay, fine, Donna.
 <br>
 It was an X-rated film.
 <br>
 And it just- There were all these people and they were doing all these things that we&#39;ve never done.
 <br>
 And it seemed like they really enjoyed doing this one thing especially.
 <br>
 And I just thought, you know, who would enjoy doing that one thing especially? My lady.
 <br>
 Eric, listen to me because this is gosh-darn important.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t do that, not without asking.
 <br>
 So, if I had asked- The answer&#39;s still no! Are you bored with our sex life? Oh, God, no.
 <br>
 Just the opposite.
 <br>
 I figured that you had to be bored.
 <br>
 And it was our hundredth time, and I just wanted to do something special.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, you count? No.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, that&#39;s so sweet.
 <br>
 But do me a favor.
 <br>
 Next time you&#39;re gonna do something weird gimme a little more warning, so I can brace myself.
 <br>
 Or tell you to back the hell off.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 - Because no matter how much I love you that was unpleasant.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, you guys.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t hang out.
 <br>
 I gotta go meetJackie.
 <br>
 [Dogs Whining] Don&#39;t look at me like that.
 <br>
 All right, five more minutes, but that is it.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Who wants to show me their belly, huh? Come on.
 <br>
 Come here, buddy! [Barking] Come here, baby.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s my little baby, huh? Who&#39;s my little baby? [Barking]
 <br>
