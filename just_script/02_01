 <br>
 All the different colored fruits living together in one cake.
 <br>
 I jumped out of a cake once I also like sweet but theres just something about salt Hip, it starts to lose its meaning after a while you know.
 <br>
 Hip, its not even a word Oh my god, listen you can hear my heart, Oh my god there it is again No that someone at the door Maybe its the cops Its just someone for the garage sale.

 <br>
 You sold Erics car? Oh no (she starts laughing) Dad you sold my car? How could you? Just what in the hell were you thinking? I thought I was helping because youre always saying how you need money.
