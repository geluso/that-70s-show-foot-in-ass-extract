<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, guys, guess what I got.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 ? No.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] A hundred bucks.
 <br>
 So money to treat your V.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 ? No.
 <br>
 My grandmother gave me this money.
 <br>
 See, my mom told her that she needed to bleach her whiskers and I was like, I go, &#34;What whiskers?&#34; Which is a total lie, &#39;cause she&#39;s got these honkin&#39; whiskers.
 <br>
 But then it made her so happy she gave me a hundred bucks.
 <br>
 Uh, no offense, Michael, but your mom&#39;s not one to talk.
 <br>
 I mean-Whoo! Hey! My mother is a beautiful woman.
 <br>
 - Apologize.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 - Whisker face.
 <br>
 All right, thank you.
 <br>
 Now we gotta go celebrate this hundred bucks.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s all go out to dinner- Someplace expensive.
 <br>
 Someplace nice.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go to the Vineyard.
 <br>
 My new lady love, Caroline, works there.
 <br>
 Caroline from the concert? Have you guys gone out again? - No.
 <br>
 - So, have you guys hung out at school? - No.
 <br>
 - Talked on the phone? No.
 <br>
 Have you had any contact with her at all? No.
 <br>
 - So Caroline&#39;s your new lady? - Yes.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 There she is.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t she lovely? She reminds me of that song &#34;Isn&#39;t She Lovely?&#34; Here she comes.
 <br>
 Here she comes.
 <br>
 Watch me impress her.
 <br>
 - Hi, Fez.
 <br>
 - [Voice Breaking] Hello, Caroline.
 <br>
 - I just came over to say hi.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hi! Bye.
 <br>
 - Bye.
 <br>
 Did you see how I played her? - Hey, Kelso, thanks for dinner.
 <br>
 It was great.
 <br>
 - Yeah, it was delicious.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, no need to thank me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m happy to do it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Everybody ready? Uh, don&#39;t you have to pay first? - I&#39;m not paying.
 <br>
 - What? What, did you think I was paying? - Yes.
 <br>
 Kelso, we don&#39;t have any money.
 <br>
 - You don&#39;t need any.
 <br>
 People, we are on a &#34;dine and dash&#34; here.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause the only thing better than eating lobster is eating lobster and hauling ass.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s haul ass.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Kelso, what the hell are you thinking? You said you&#39;d take care of it.
 <br>
 And I took care of it- by planning the &#34;dine and dash.
 <br>
 &#34; Kelso, we&#39;re not doing it.
 <br>
 Why not? Guys, we&#39;re making memories here.
 <br>
 Kelso, it&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Wrong? Or hilarious? Wrong, you dill-hole.
 <br>
 Or hilariously wrong.
 <br>
 I like it.
 <br>
 But then again, I&#39;m from the underbelly of society, so- Uh, yes, excuse me.
 <br>
 Um, would you please send your finest imported beer to Caroline and tell her that when I said &#34;Hi&#34; what I meant was, &#34;I&#39;ll take you like a stallion.
 <br>
 &#34; You got that? Like a stallion? Fez, stop ordering stuff.
 <br>
 Okay, you need to chill out, little girl.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you hear Kelso? The Vineyard is having a dine-and-dash promotion.
 <br>
 Everything is free.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not free, Fez.
 <br>
 &#34;Dine and dash&#34; is when you run out without paying.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s stealing? This isn&#39;t going to help me with Caroline, is it? Excuse me.
 <br>
 [Whispering] [Whispering] Hey! That&#39;s from me, you son of a bitch.
 <br>
 Oh, good, honey, you&#39;re home.
 <br>
 Listen.
 <br>
 The Pinciottis called.
 <br>
 They wanted to have card night tonight, so- No, Kitty, you just call them back, &#39;cause there&#39;s no way in hell that I&#39;m gonna have card night with the Pinciottis &#39;cause it&#39;s just too much fun.
 <br>
 - Hello, Bob and Midge.
 <br>
 - [Nervous Laugh] - What the hell are they doing here? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 So! Who else needs a drink real bad? Tough day at the salt mines, Red? Oh.
 <br>
 When did you get a job at the salt mines? Here, honey.
 <br>
 Play with these.
 <br>
 Yeah workin&#39;Joe.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell ya.
 <br>
 Since my business went bankrupt I got a lot of free time.
 <br>
 I mainly use it to nap and cry.
 <br>
 Well, uh, Bob don&#39;t cry on the cards.
 <br>
 It makes &#39;em hard to shuffle.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Michael, I have never dined and dashed, and I&#39;m not about to start now.
 <br>
 Uh, well- Remember when we went to nice restaurants and I told you to wait in the car while I paid? Did you ever wonder why I was running to the car? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a thief.
 <br>
 I think technically you&#39;re an accessory.
 <br>
 Which should make you happy, because you love accessories- - earrings, bracelets, bangles, bows- - Shut up! So, did you enjoy your pilsner? Did you get the message about the stallion? Okay, look, okay? You can&#39;t send beer to the hostess podium, okay? I almost got fired.
 <br>
 So just pretend you don&#39;t know me, okay? I don&#39;t think I do know you, Caroline.
 <br>
 Caroline has upset me.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait to dine and dash on her ass- her beautiful ass.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll go first.
 <br>
 - Hyde, we&#39;re not doing this.
 <br>
 And especially not you, &#39;cause you&#39;re on probation.
 <br>
 - So what? - So what? You get caught, you go to jail, and I&#39;ve heard nothing good about jail.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t done one stinkin&#39; illegal thing since I got probation.
 <br>
 So, what, you&#39;re mad because you haven&#39;t committed any crimes since your last crime? Yeah, so I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 [Slow, Distorted] Can I help you? - What happened? - This place is like Alcatraz, man.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no way out.
 <br>
 So it was either a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Or I rubbed my eyes too hard.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Good story, Midge.
 <br>
 So, Red, how&#39;s work? Well, yesterday I hired some new guy down in sporting goods - but I don&#39;t know- - Whoa.
 <br>
 You hired a new guy? [Chuckles] Oh, that&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 I remember when I was doing the hiring at my store, and you were out of work.
 <br>
 I hired you neighbor.
 <br>
 - Listen, Bob- - No.
 <br>
 Midgie? - We&#39;re going home.
 <br>
 - But I have gin.
 <br>
 We&#39;re playing bridge! I can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve gone soft, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m like Forman.
 <br>
 It sickens me.
 <br>
 Mm.
 <br>
 So you can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 I wonder why.
 <br>
 - Why, oh, why? - Oh! I know why.
 <br>
 - Yes, Donna? - Because it&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right, Miss Pinciotti.
 <br>
 It&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Gee, what a surprise- Mom and Dad don&#39;t want to do it.
 <br>
 We are not Mom and Dad.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re not leaving without paying, young man.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll pay for the stupid dinner.
 <br>
 Now just give me your stupid keys so I can get my money out of your stupid car.
 <br>
 Stupid.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re in the freakin&#39; Olympics about to run the freakin&#39; hundred-yard dash- If someone sends you a beer, you say thank you and drink the freakin&#39; beer.
 <br>
 Um, Eric? Did Kelso leave his money at home? - &#39;Cause he just drove away in the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 - What? No.
 <br>
 No, he wouldn&#39;t ditch us.
 <br>
 Are you sure? &#39;Cause as he drove past he was doing this- No.
 <br>
 Donna, he&#39;s kidding.
 <br>
 He wouldn&#39;t ditch us.
 <br>
 He ditched us! I&#39;m sure he&#39;s right outside.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get him.
 <br>
 - Fez, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go and get the money and come back.
 <br>
 You can trust me.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s not coming back! - And we trusted him.
 <br>
 Foreigners lie.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m just gonna call my dad, and he&#39;ll come pay for our dinner.
 <br>
 Okay, but, Jackie, if you don&#39;t come back- Eric, please.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not immature like those idiots.
 <br>
 She is immature like those idiots! I can&#39;t believe I got stuck here with the squares.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not squares! Donna, settle down.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t want to upset your stomach.
 <br>
 This is bad, man.
 <br>
 If I&#39;m not fighting against the system, I am the system.
 <br>
 Screw it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 [Deep Breaths] Banzai! Okay, I can take the check now.
 <br>
 Or whenever or now.
 <br>
 Uh- Two more bananas Foster, please.
 <br>
 Eric, what are you doing? I&#39;m stalling.
 <br>
 They&#39;ll come back.
 <br>
 Joke&#39;s over, you know? Best thing about this joke, it just keeps going and going.
 <br>
 [Laughs] And not only did we break the law we screwed our friends while breaking the law.
 <br>
 How dumb was he to give me the car keys? I mean, who here trusts me? - [Hyde] No way.
 <br>
 - [Jackie] Not me.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 You know what? Stolen food just tastes better.
 <br>
 Dinner roll? Guys, I feel bad about Eric and Donna.
 <br>
 Maybe we should figure out a way to help them.
 <br>
 Sure, we could do that.
 <br>
 Or we could ask ourselves, &#34;How can we make this worse?&#34; [All] Happy anniversary Happy anniversary HaPPy anniversary Donna and Eric With best wishes from Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie.
 <br>
 - Oh, this is just terrible.
 <br>
 - Oh, Kitty.
 <br>
 Quincy&#39;s no Columbo, but he&#39;s still pretty good.
 <br>
 Red, Bob was very upset when he left here.
 <br>
 Bob&#39;s always upset.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a little girl in big boy pants.
 <br>
 Well, why didn&#39;t you offer him a job? I didn&#39;t want to insult him by offering him some nothing job.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, you insult him every day.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s different.
 <br>
 He thinks I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 Kitty, this is about a man&#39;s dignity.
 <br>
 Oh, sure, it was- It was awful, what happened.
 <br>
 But let&#39;s just put it behind us and watch Quincy.
 <br>
 Hey! Oh, come on, Red.
 <br>
 How bad would it be working with Bob? It&#39;s a big store.
 <br>
 You&#39;d hardly ever see him.
 <br>
 Maybe you could- You could hide from him.
 <br>
 He&#39;d find me.
 <br>
 He always finds me.
 <br>
 Well, you better think of something because they are gonna live next door to us for a long, long time.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know that.
 <br>
 He&#39;s out of work.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll probably lose the house.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll talk to Bob.
 <br>
 But you gotta work on your sense of humor, lady.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t believe those guys screwed us like this.
 <br>
 - Well, at least we still have each other.
 <br>
 - You know what? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t count on much in this crazy world, but I can always count on you.
 <br>
 That is so true.
 <br>
 - I have to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Hey! Why don&#39;t you just sit your lyin&#39; ass down? Eric, don&#39;t you trust me? [Chuckling] Not as far as I can throw you, and that ain&#39;t far.
 <br>
 How can you say that? Okay, so I noticed the fire exit was next to the bathroom.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d use it.
 <br>
 I happened to notice it, that&#39;s all.
 <br>
 It&#39;s very convenient.
 <br>
 Donna, don&#39;t you see what&#39;s happening? They&#39;ve turned us against each other.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I was gonna use the fire exit.
 <br>
 I was! You know why they do this? Because they know we won&#39;t get them back.
 <br>
 We&#39;re responsible, mature &#34;Mom and Dad.
 <br>
 &#34; We just- We won&#39;t stoop to their level.
 <br>
 Well, damn it, let&#39;s stoop to their level or an even lower level.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m with you, baby, yeah.
 <br>
 There&#39;s just one problem.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t do it from in here.
 <br>
 If I don&#39;t make it tell Mama I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t talk like that.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll tell her yourself.
 <br>
 Hey, Bob.
 <br>
 So, taking out your trash, huh? No, Red, I&#39;m bringing it back in.
 <br>
 Yeah, Bob.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good one.
 <br>
 Listen, I want to offer you a job at Price Mart.
 <br>
 - Geez, Red, Price Mart? - What? Yeah, that may be fine for you, but you&#39;re talking to a guy who owned his own business.
 <br>
 And ran it into the ground.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m, uh- [Chuckles] I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Just take the job, Bob.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s fine, Bob.
 <br>
 There is no job.
 <br>
 Forget it.
 <br>
 Oh, so now you&#39;re not offering me a job.
 <br>
 I just offered you the job, and you said you didn&#39;t want the job.
 <br>
 Well, ask me again.
 <br>
 Oh, cripes.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] You want a job at Price Mart, Bob? I&#39;ll think about it.
 <br>
 Go to hell, Bob! Okay, you guys.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Good one last night.
 <br>
 You know, ditching us at the restaurant and everything.
 <br>
 Yeah, we got you so bad.
 <br>
 You really did.
 <br>
 We laughed and laughed.
 <br>
 To show you guys we&#39;re such good sports we made you guys a batch of special brownies.
 <br>
 Special brownies.
 <br>
 Like the sPecial kind of special? The best kind of special.
 <br>
 Something&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t feel special.
 <br>
 Me neither.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t think those were special brownies, man.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no.
 <br>
 They&#39;re special.
 <br>
 Say, Donna, do you have any more of that sPecial ingredient we used? Well, I certainly do, Eric.
 <br>
 Chocolate Super-Lax.
 <br>
 - You didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - We did.
 <br>
 We so did.
 <br>
 Now maybe you&#39;ll think twice before screwing us.
 <br>
 Well, nice try, &#39;cause I don&#39;t feel any- [Sharp Groan] - [Groaning] - [Groaning] [Groaning] Oh, no.
 <br>
 I am last.
 <br>
 - Ay, no! - I know.
 <br>
 You&#39;re surprised to see me, right? And upset.
 <br>
 - Yes, many things are upset.
 <br>
 - Okay, listen.
 <br>
 Okay, listen, Fez.
 <br>
 About last night- I know you were angry, and you have every right to be.
 <br>
 But you know what this was? - Our first fight.
 <br>
 - Oh! And it made us a real couple- if you can forgive me.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Move away from the door.
 <br>
 - So we&#39;re okay? - [Groaning] - Good.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s make up like a real couple.
 <br>
 [Groaning] You bastards! Wait, Fez! Wait up! [Laughs] Okay, you guys.
 <br>
 That was a wicked burn.
 <br>
 It had all the elements: You didn&#39;t see it coming, parts of it really hurt- [Chuckling] Well, Kelso, I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.
 <br>
 Oh, I did.
 <br>
 I got my eye on you two.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not gonna burn me like that again.
 <br>
 - I love our friends.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 Hey, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking about your offer and I want you to know, I made a decision.
 <br>
 Oh, goody.
 <br>
 But I need you to ask me again.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Bob, would you, uh like a job at Price Mart? Say it like you mean it.
 <br>
 Go to hell, Bob!
 <br>
