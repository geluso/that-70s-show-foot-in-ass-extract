<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Forman, your bachelor party&#39;s tonight.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going to a strip club, so don&#39;t forget your inhaler.
 <br>
 Come on, Hyde.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need a silly bachelor party.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, man.
 <br>
 Be one last night of the finest debauchery that point place has to offer.
 <br>
 Hyde, all I need is my sweetie here for the rest of my life.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s all right, Eric.
 <br>
 You can go.
 <br>
 - All right! I&#39;m gonna see nudies! Oh, Eric, you&#39;re not going to one of those hoochie mama shows, are you? Don&#39;t worry, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll return your son in the same slightly girly condition that he leaves in.
 <br>
 So, Donna, you and the gals getting together for a big shindig? Well, Jackie might be planning.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 No, wait.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t do things for other people.
 <br>
 Well, let me plan your bachelorette party.
 <br>
 Oh, we went absolutely bonkers at mine.
 <br>
 All my girlfriends came over for a sewing bee, and then my friend Gloria gave me my first sip of hard cider.
 <br>
 Boy, you girls are crazy.
 <br>
 Well, back then,we had some morals, not like you girls today.
 <br>
 loose, throwing it around town like the paperboy.
 <br>
 Donna, why am I blindfolded? Because I have a big surprise for you.
 <br>
 Okay, you ready? Isn&#39;t it awesome? We&#39;re gonna spray-paint our names on a trailer? All right! No, I put a deposit on it so we can live here.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s gonna be our very own.
 <br>
 Oh, how romantic.
 <br>
 I can just see Donna carrying you over that threshold.
 <br>
 So come on.
 <br>
 I know you always dreamed about having a home of your own.
 <br>
 Well, I guess I should have been more specific.
 <br>
 Um, no, no.
 <br>
 You know what? This is nice.
 <br>
 It&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Donna, this is great! Steven, if you ever rent me a trailer, I will dump you in a second.
 <br>
 Good to know.
 <br>
 I need an exit strategy.
 <br>
 See, now if we all turn this way There.
 <br>
 See? Room for everybody.
 <br>
 See? Now this is the closeness I&#39;ve been craving.
 <br>
 Whose hand is that? - Mine.
 <br>
 - Mine.
 <br>
 - Mine.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 Look at this tiny shower.
 <br>
 Donna, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s room in there for you to soap your chest like we like.
 <br>
 Donna are you sure you want to live in point place? I always thought you wanted to leave town.
 <br>
 Well, Eric, that&#39;s when I was single.
 <br>
 But now that we&#39;re getting married, I want to settle down and start our lives together.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I always thought - You smell pretty.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Look, can we do this in private? Bathroom&#39;s free.
 <br>
 Um, actually, I was just, uh, heading there.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Pardon me.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Let me just get the, uh, curtain.
 <br>
 Okay, I can&#39;t do this with all you listening.
 <br>
 Somebody&#39;s gonna have to sing.
 <br>
 - Fez, you sing.
 <br>
 - I can&#39;t do both at the same time.
 <br>
 Please hurry! On the good ship lollipop it&#39;s a sweet trip to the candy shop where the bonbons play I had a large soda.
 <br>
 On the sunny beach of peppermint bay That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 6 - Episode 23 &#34;My wife&#34; So it&#39;s ours starting today.
 <br>
 I signed the lease for a year.
 <br>
 Donna, all you ever talked about was seeing the world, and And my dad&#39;s better now.
 <br>
 I mean, we can get out.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t wanna get out.
 <br>
 I just want to focus on doing this marriage thing right, And I think that means curling up every night next to you on that dining room table that doubles as a bed.
 <br>
 Well, the good news is, if you guys do decide to travel, You can always drive your house to any number of vacation destinations.
 <br>
 Yeah, and if you ever want to rearrange your furniture, all you gotta do is slam on the brakes.
 <br>
 Hold everything.
 <br>
 I believe that is the ice cream man.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 Look, he&#39;s turning around! No! No, Come back! We&#39;re not from here! We won&#39;t rob you! Oh I mean, it&#39;s pretty here.
 <br>
 There&#39;s lots of open space.
 <br>
 I&#39;m coming in, Tracy! There better not be anyone in there with ya! Hey, the neighbors seem really nice.
 <br>
 Just tell him you&#39;re naked &#39;cause.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I&#39;m climbing out the window.
 <br>
 Casey Kelso? Hey! Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Casey, I thought you left town after going out with Donna and then breaking up with her so she had to settle for Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I found my way back.
 <br>
 Hey, For-play.
 <br>
 - You been working out? - Oh, um, - Well, yeah, a few days a week.
 <br>
 - Oh, man, I&#39;m just kidding.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s not funny.
 <br>
 He&#39;s huge.
 <br>
 Things are great.
 <br>
 Eric and I are getting married.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on the radio.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 &#34;Hot Donna.
 <br>
 &#34; You might&#39;ve heard people talking, wishing they could date me, that kind of stuff.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, Donna hasn&#39;t thought about you at all, although Eric&#39;s mom still asks about you.
 <br>
 Then she kind of giggles and fans herself.
 <br>
 You! You get back here! Hey, little advice.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 never answer the phone when you&#39;re with a married lady.
 <br>
 See, Forman? Now at the bachelor party you can hold a beer even after you&#39;ve lost the ability to hold a beer from drinking all the beer.
 <br>
 I like it.
 <br>
 Kind of makes me wonder why god didn&#39;t just make us this way from the start, you know? Don&#39;t worry, man.
 <br>
 Evolution will take care of it.
 <br>
 Hey, Steven, I took out all the $1 bills from your wallet, so now you have nothing to tip the strippers with.
 <br>
 All I have left is this $20? Jeez, I&#39;ll never be able to get change for this.
 <br>
 Sorry I&#39;m late, guys.
 <br>
 I spent all afternoon in front of the mirror.
 <br>
 Then I realized it was time to get dressed.
 <br>
 Fez, you don&#39;t have to look nice, all right? Strippers like everybody.
 <br>
 They&#39;re raised that way on special farms out west.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, I talked to my boss down at the radio station, and I told him we were staying in town, and I said that if he wanted to keep me, he would have to put me on the air full-time, - And he went for it! &#34;Hot Donna&#34; every day on WFDP.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, that&#39;s amazing.
 <br>
 All you had to do is ask? Oh, and I tied my shirt up in one of those sexy knots.
 <br>
 Yeah, Jackie does that.
 <br>
 We have never paid to get into Six Flags.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 But, Donna, if you take this job, how are you gonna.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - Why are you waving a mug at me? I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 How are you gonna find time for college? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just stop going.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m a DJ.
 <br>
 I already have the kind of job I was going to college to get.
 <br>
 Yeah, college sucks anyways.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all smart people, and none of them are as pretty as me.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Half the people in this room ought to be in magazines.
 <br>
 Only half, though, and the rest of you know who you are.
 <br>
 Eric, we both have jobs.
 <br>
 We have a great place to live.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re gonna have the perfect life in point place.
 <br>
 - Huh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never heard the words &#34;perfect life&#34; and &#34;Point Place&#34; used in the same sentence oh, except when separated by the phrase &#34;as soon as I get the hell out of.
 <br>
 &#34; All right.
 <br>
 We gentlemen have a place to be.
 <br>
 So unless you ladies are gonna finally take your clothes off to music Last chance? No? Okay.
 <br>
 Wow, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you can really whip up a party in no time.
 <br>
 And we have activities.
 <br>
 Okay, now watch.
 <br>
 You tie the ribbon in a bow, and voil√†, decorative bags of almonds.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll make 300 to pass out at the wedding.
 <br>
 Wait, this is Donna&#39;s bachelorette party? What other manual laborare we gonna do? Huh, scrub a toilet, dig a trench, write a book? Well, if we don&#39;t do this, who will? I can&#39;t believe you invited me over and you don&#39;t have any dip.
 <br>
 Red, we&#39;re having a girl&#39;s night out.
 <br>
 I need you to bag all the almonds and tie &#39;em with a bow.
 <br>
 - Why me? - &#39;Cause I said so.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t want to.
 <br>
 - Well, you have to.
 <br>
 - Oh, you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you make me crazy.
 <br>
 - Oh, you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you make me crazy.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Since you&#39;re getting married, I&#39;ll teach you how to do that.
 <br>
 - To Forman and Donna.
 <br>
 - TO FORMAN AND DONNA! Where is Forman? - Who cares?! - WHO CARES?!! How did I not know about this place? I spent my whole life trying to get girls to take their clothes off, and all I needed was $10.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t understand why chicks don&#39;t like guys to look at strippers.
 <br>
 I mean, these women are artists.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like Leonardo.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 or da Vinci.
 <br>
 - Bravo.
 <br>
 - Bravo.
 <br>
 Bravo.
 <br>
 Forman, where&#39;s your beer hand? I chewed off the tape in the men&#39;s room.
 <br>
 Wait, that was you makin&#39; those sounds? Hey, you know, forget what I said about there being a mummy in the bathroom.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t stop thinking about what Donna&#39;s doing.
 <br>
 The only reason she&#39;s still in Point Place is &#39;cause of me.
 <br>
 If it weren&#39;t for me, she&#39;d probably be on the other side of the World by now.
 <br>
 Hey, I grew up on that side of the world, and it&#39;s no picnic.
 <br>
 Although when you eat every meal on the ground, I suppose, technically it is a picnic.
 <br>
 Look, all I know is if I let Donna stay in Point Place, she&#39;s gonna miss out on all those great things she wanted to do, and it&#39;ll be all my fault.
 <br>
 Forman, would you quit whining? Donna&#39;s gonna marry you.
 <br>
 From where I&#39;m sittin&#39;, what&#39;s on your plate looks pretty good.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t cut open the sausage, Forman.
 <br>
 You just eat it.
 <br>
 Well, I wish it were that easy, Hyde, but it&#39;s a complex emotional issue Hey, Phil Donahue, live nudes.
 <br>
 Oh, well, now this looks like a good place for a bachelorette party.
 <br>
 Yeah, did you see that neon sign out front? It had a naked man with an arrow pointing this way.
 <br>
 Um, I don&#39;t think that was an arrow.
 <br>
 Welcome to the little boy&#39;s room where every night is ladies&#39; night.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 everybody&#39;s pants come off.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a catchy slogan.
 <br>
 These guys have been doing some hard time, and they&#39;re dyin&#39; to meet some ladies.
 <br>
 Well, now he.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 he looks like he&#39;s been a bad boy! Take it off! Take it off! Is that how we do this? I&#39;m not sure how to be naughty in public.
 <br>
 Ooh! These guys are goin&#39; back to jail for assault with a sexy weapon.
 <br>
 Oh, my god, Casey? Oh, my god, Casey! it&#39;s just, Donna&#39;s giving up everything she ever wanted.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t help but feel like I&#39;m holding her back, you know? Okay, just so you know, I make most my money on tips.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Here, you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 y.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 y.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - You should probably just take this.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 Forman, would you quit depressing the strippers? When you depress the strippers, they go like this.
 <br>
 Yeah, this isn&#39;t some hole in the wall where hopeless losers blow their money on people who don&#39;t care about their problems.
 <br>
 This is a strip joint.
 <br>
 Yes, it is, Eric.
 <br>
 You&#39;re ruining the romance.
 <br>
 You, dance for my money! And the rabbit runs around and then back in the hole.
 <br>
 Hey, Red, what do ya think of my nut bag? Ha ha, Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;m done with this.
 <br>
 This is not man&#39;s work.
 <br>
 I mean, if Kitty wanted me to shoot the almonds at some communists, that I could do.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re a big talker now that she&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not afraid of her, and I&#39;m not doin&#39; this, and I don&#39;t care if it means I have to sit through another one of her silent breakfasts.
 <br>
 - What, she just sits there? - I talk, she just ignores me.
 <br>
 I had to buy a bottle of Mrs.
 <br>
 Butterworth&#39;s just so that someone would smile at me.
 <br>
 You can always call me, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;d rather talk to syrup.
 <br>
 - So workin&#39; at a strip club.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 I finally found a way to cash in on my good looks without having to humiliate myself.
 <br>
 No, you&#39;re not humiliating yourself.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re not the naked guy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the guy who introduces the naked guy.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m surprised to see you&#39;re still in town.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;d always talked about gettin&#39; outta here.
 <br>
 I always thought you&#39;d be some place more glamorous by now, like Paris or Reno.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve got Eric and my job and a great place to live in and/or pull behind a car.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s not what I expected, but it&#39;s definitely the right thing to do.
 <br>
 You know, that trailer is tiny, and I need room to roam.
 <br>
 born free as free as the.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 something free you know, this town is so small, I don&#39;t even know what free is.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Look, listen, I&#39;ve been other places, and it&#39;s not that great.
 <br>
 I mean, since I came back here, I&#39;ve got it made.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 free drinks, I can borrow any of these freaky costumes when I want.
 <br>
 Plus, you know, - It&#39;s showbiz.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 So You&#39;re happy here.
 <br>
 Yeah, and you will be, too.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t worry, you know, by the time you have a few kids, you&#39;ll probably be livin&#39; in a much bigger trailer.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 You home already? I thought those boys would take your clothes and leave you naked in Indiana.
 <br>
 You kids.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you just don&#39;t know how to do anything.
 <br>
 Listen, dad, Donna wants to stay in Point Place after we get married.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 how can that be a good idea? Son, in this relationship, you&#39;re gonna have one instinct, and Donna&#39;s gonna have another.
 <br>
 Always go with hers.
 <br>
 If history has taught us anything, it&#39;s that you&#39;re always wrong.
 <br>
 What about the time that I oh, yeah, I got nothin&#39;.
 <br>
 You know, being with your mother has taught me one thing.
 <br>
 A man can only rise to the level of the woman that he&#39;s with.
 <br>
 hey, what&#39;s up? I saw a naked man&#39;s butt.
 <br>
 Donna, happy fifth anniversary! Hey, I want you to put on your best dress, because there&#39;s another sequel to &#34;Star Wars.
 <br>
 &#34; And Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Eric Forman are gonna be first in line.
 <br>
 What&#39;s goin&#39; on? I&#39;m leaving you, Eric.
 <br>
 What? Wh.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 We could see the new Jane Fonda movie instead.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m miserable.
 <br>
 How can you let me settle for this? But you said this is what you wanted.
 <br>
 Well, I was wrong.
 <br>
 I guess I was just trying to make you happy, and I forgot about myself.
 <br>
 I mean, I wanted to see the world, not the inside of a trailer.
 <br>
 But, Donna, I love you.
 <br>
 I love you, too, but it&#39;s not enough.
 <br>
 Good-bye, Eric.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Yes, - Can you just take that? - You can just squeeze through there.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Hey, For-play.
 <br>
 - Casey? - Yeah, your mom said I could bunk here.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t worry, bud, as soon as everybody&#39;s asleep, I&#39;m gonna head over to your sister&#39;s room.
 <br>
 so beautiful morning, huh? boy, these waffles look great.
 <br>
 <br>
