<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 All right, Hyde! Your dad&#39;s apartment is the perfect place for a party.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s already trashed.
 <br>
 - [Radio: Christmas Rock] Hey, even if half the people we invited show up, this party&#39;s gonna rock.
 <br>
 - Did you find the cups? - Nope.
 <br>
 Even better.
 <br>
 A plastic tube and a funnel.
 <br>
 All this and a dirty funnel? Merry Christmas to me.
 <br>
 Yeah, we don&#39;t even have to worry about germs because even though our spit backs up in the tube the alcohol kills &#39;em.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re leaving.
 <br>
 - So leaving.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 You&#39;re leaving? - Yeah, see when I was a little girl, I made a promise to myself.
 <br>
 &#34;Self,&#34; I said, &#34;if you&#39;re ever about to suck beer out of a funnel that might give you mono, don&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#34; So bye-bye.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Kelso, I&#39;m gonna nix the funnel on account of I think it repels women.
 <br>
 Hey, any woman who doesn&#39;t appreciate a nice funnel isn&#39;t much of a woman.
 <br>
 - Hey, guys.
 <br>
 - Oh, hey.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s with the keg? - Throwin&#39; a little party.
 <br>
 You know, &#39;tis the season to get sloppy.
 <br>
 - Well, uh- - You&#39;re cool with this, right? Sure.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Cool dad.
 <br>
 That&#39;s me.
 <br>
 - [Chuckling] - Totally cool dad.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Hey, listen.
 <br>
 Have a merry, uh, keg party.
 <br>
 - [Laughs] - Mr.
 <br>
 Hyde, you&#39;re the best.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re the best.
 <br>
 Will you be my daddy? I&#39;m not kidding.
 <br>
 Seriously.
 <br>
 - Oh, hey, Fez, can you grab this for me? - Sure.
 <br>
 You know, Kelso, four times is not funny.
 <br>
 Um, yes, it is.
 <br>
 - [Knocking] - [Kitty] Guess who? - Eric, it&#39;s your mom! - [Knocking Continues] - Oh, I&#39;m not- - [All Singing] Oh, you&#39;re caroling.
 <br>
 [Laughs] That is so odd.
 <br>
 Well, um, happy holidays.
 <br>
 Look what I brought.
 <br>
 Mistletoe! - [Laughing] - Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Uh-uh.
 <br>
 Uh-oh! Uh-oh! [Laughing] [Humming] Now, Steven, I brought some beautiful Christmas ornaments to hang on your antenna.
 <br>
 Ah, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you&#39;re not checking up on me, are you? No, no, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just spreading a little holiday cheer.
 <br>
 Dusty.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Oh, and this blanket, it needs a nice Christmas washing.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no! That&#39;s Bud&#39;s Christmas stool.
 <br>
 Very sentimental.
 <br>
 If anybody touches it, he just goes nuts, so- Huh.
 <br>
 Well, um, I don&#39;t quite believe you, but okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, um, Bud left you boys here unsupervised? Oh, salami in the couch.
 <br>
 Now, that&#39;s sanitary.
 <br>
 Okay! Okay, then, um, why don&#39;t you boys hang up those angels? And, um, Eric, come in here and help me with the traditional holiday floor wax.
 <br>
 Mom, seriously, we&#39;re okay.
 <br>
 You can go, really.
 <br>
 [Soft Clatter] Oh, good.
 <br>
 Fez is making ice.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Ooh.
 <br>
 Listen to this.
 <br>
 &#34;Corner Him Under the Mistletoe: Eight Ways to Trick a Guy Into a Relationship.
 <br>
 &#34; [Squeals] I love the holidays.
 <br>
 Yeah, hanging your stocking, putting cookies out for Santa, setting a man trap.
 <br>
 Mmm, Christmas.
 <br>
 You know, this&#39;ll be the first year I celebrate Christmas without a boyfriend.
 <br>
 And Jesus wept.
 <br>
 So here&#39;s my new plan for the year: Buy some really cute tops, fly to Hollywood and marry Lee Majors.
 <br>
 Make fun of that.
 <br>
 I dare you.
 <br>
 Jackie, there are so many ways to make fun of that I don&#39;t even know where to start.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like choosing your favorite jelly bean.
 <br>
 Donna, be nice to me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m lonely.
 <br>
 I mean, okay, if there were mistletoe over me right now who would kiss me? No one.
 <br>
 That&#39;s who.
 <br>
 Being alone isn&#39;t that bad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a great opportunity to get to know yourself and be comfortable with who you are.
 <br>
 Donna, I already love myself.
 <br>
 I just wanna French someone.
 <br>
 I miss my funnel.
 <br>
 - [Coin Clinks Against Glass] - Eric, drink.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 If I was Tattoo, and I lived on Fantasy Island my fantasy would be to not be a midget.
 <br>
 Am I right? - [Coin Clinks Against Glass] - Hmm.
 <br>
 Eenie, meenie, miney, Forman.
 <br>
 You know, Hyde, at first I thought your dad was a real dirtbag but I&#39;ve come to realize that there&#39;s a fine line between dirtbag and Father of the Year! - [Coin Clinks On Table] - Damn! Fellas, I have to be honest.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never played quarters before, so I probably stink.
 <br>
 - [Coin Clinks Against Glass] - Oh, happy day! Eric.
 <br>
 Man, this is the worst game in the world.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m so thirsty.
 <br>
 - [Coin Clinks Against Glass] Damn it! Eric, drink! I mean, he lives on Fantasy Island, man and he&#39;s a midget! It&#39;s so obvious.
 <br>
 - [Exhales Forcefully] - [Coin Clinks Against Glass] Hmm.
 <br>
 Mmmm, Forman.
 <br>
 Does anyone else feel kind of woozy? - [Coin Clinks Against Table] - Oh, what the hell, man? If I make this shot, I promise I will not pick you, Eric.
 <br>
 [Coin Clinks Against Glass] I pick you, Eric.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun to lie.
 <br>
 Donna, that&#39;s Fireman Rob and Fireman Dean.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re firemen! - Jackie, they&#39;re, like, 40.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 They&#39;re firemen! Two hot firemen in a bar.
 <br>
 [Squeals] This is just like that play I wrote.
 <br>
 Okay, give me five minutes.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll pick the one I want, and you can have the other.
 <br>
 Hello! I&#39;m dating someone.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Donna, Dean can bench-press a keg.
 <br>
 - Eric can&#39;t even bench-press a cup.
 <br>
 - He can too.
 <br>
 Rob, Dean, this is Donna.
 <br>
 - [Clears Throat] - So, what do you girls do? That&#39;s funny you should ask.
 <br>
 We, uh, go to high school! - Any outside interests? - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 High school guys! Kelso, it&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not that drunk.
 <br>
 I just- [Clears Throat] I just can&#39;t walk or see.
 <br>
 Man, that was- That was a great party! You know-You know who doesn&#39;t like parties? Red.
 <br>
 &#34;I&#39;m Red! I don&#39;t like parties &#39;cause I&#39;m a big, bald, party pooper!&#34; Uh-oh.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Uh-oh.
 <br>
 [Retching] Son of a bitch! Eric, when did you eat spaghetti? I knew something was going on at Bud&#39;s.
 <br>
 When I went over there, the only thing in the fridge- olives.
 <br>
 And poor Fez had ice in his pants.
 <br>
 My head hurts.
 <br>
 That&#39;s your brain trying to comprehend its own stupidity.
 <br>
 I mean, what kind of parent leaves a bunch of teenagers alone with a keg? A fun one? Hey, Jim Beam, can it.
 <br>
 Red, you need to have a talk with Bud.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s home now.
 <br>
 And what goes on between Bud and Steven is between Bud and Steven.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just not a good dad.
 <br>
 Well, you know what? I agree.
 <br>
 So, I think we should get in the car pick up Steven and move him back in with us and feed him and- and clothe him and love him.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not loving anybody that I&#39;m not legally required to.
 <br>
 [Mutters] Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll call Bud.
 <br>
 And, Eric, I&#39;ll deal with you later.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Mommy, I don&#39;t feel so good.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re gonna get sick again, why don&#39;t you throw up under the tree because Christmas is ruined! Oh, no.
 <br>
 So, tell me more about the big ladder thingy.
 <br>
 Oh, the cherry picker? Funny story.
 <br>
 True story.
 <br>
 Okay, Jackie, this is a nightmare, and we&#39;re leaving.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, you have a boyfriend, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 And maybe I don&#39;t want to sit home alone every night.
 <br>
 And if somebody doesn&#39;t tell me I&#39;m cute in the next five minutes, I&#39;m gonna scream! Hi.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 My friend was being a wet blanket.
 <br>
 Well, maybe I should talk to her.
 <br>
 I mean, a wet blanket&#39;s a fireman&#39;s best friend.
 <br>
 Boy, something about you is so familiar.
 <br>
 I get that all the time.
 <br>
 See from the right, I look like Gidget and from the left, I look like Elizabeth Taylor.
 <br>
 - Neat, huh? - Nah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s- Oh, it&#39;s your laugh! You know, I used to date a girl with the same laugh, but, uh, it was 20 years ago.
 <br>
 She dumped me and married some rich lawyer.
 <br>
 Burk- Burkhart! That was it.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, that&#39;s my name! And my dad&#39;s a rich lawyer! [Together] Oh, my God! So, Jackie, was this in the play you wrote? Kitty, why are you smoking? It&#39;s my Yuletide cigarette.
 <br>
 To celebrate all the children who spend black Christmases with bad parents.
 <br>
 Kitty, put that out.
 <br>
 - Back off, Grinch.
 <br>
 - [Doorbell Rings] Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Hey, Kitty.
 <br>
 Bad parent.
 <br>
 - Is she all right? - Hmm? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Uh, sit down, Bud.
 <br>
 Kitty, sweetheart why don&#39;t you leave us alone for a minute? A boy can&#39;t live on olives.
 <br>
 Bud- Eric just came back from your place falling-down drunk.
 <br>
 He threw up on my shoes.
 <br>
 Now, what were you thinking, leaving kids alone with a keg? [Sighs] Look, Red, I&#39;ve never really been a dad before.
 <br>
 L-I&#39;m just trying to- I don&#39;t know- take it easy, be his friend.
 <br>
 Why would you be friends with a 17-year-old? They&#39;re idiots.
 <br>
 Bud, being a teenager is like being in combat.
 <br>
 One minute you&#39;re crawling around half blind- the next, you&#39;re looking for your own foot.
 <br>
 - Follow me? - Not really.
 <br>
 I was a conscientious Canadian.
 <br>
 Well, if you weren&#39;t chicken and you did fight who would you want as your lieutenant, me or you? [Chuckling] Well, you, &#39;cause you&#39;re mean and scary.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Steven doesn&#39;t need another friend, Bud.
 <br>
 Steven needs somebody to ride his ass.
 <br>
 He may not like it.
 <br>
 He may not thank you for it.
 <br>
 He may do impressions of you behind your back.
 <br>
 He thinks he&#39;s so damn funny.
 <br>
 But the point is, he&#39;ll know right from wrong because you did your job.
 <br>
 Huh.
 <br>
 Bread, ham, bananas, milk.
 <br>
 Because there are four food groups, Bud! Four! - [Groaning] - [Radio] I am so grossed out.
 <br>
 I need a Calgon bath, a facial, some Tater Tots and someJean Naté.
 <br>
 - This night was the worst.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 I mean, I am not gonna find love in a bar.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m gonna find there are guys who used to French my mom.
 <br>
 Just this morning, I was playing with My Pretty Ponies.
 <br>
 Look what you&#39;ve done to me! Look! Me? I&#39;m not the one who hooked up with the volunteer fire department.
 <br>
 I am never gonna meet anybody and I&#39;m never, ever gonna feel better, ever.
 <br>
 Jackie, when you&#39;re sad, you look exactly like Mary Tyler Moore.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! Donna, I do.
 <br>
 I am gonna make it after all! Damn! Okay, everybody, here we go.
 <br>
 Now, if I catch on fire, you promise to put me out? Well, I&#39;m sure someone will.
 <br>
 Right, guys? Okay, great.
 <br>
 Steven, I gotta tal- - What the hell are you doing? - It is complicated.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Party&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Everybody out.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing, Bud? Steven, this place is a madhouse.
 <br>
 There are kids all over the place, and this guy could&#39;ve burst into flames.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll never know now, will we, Bud? Look, Eric went home so drunk, he threw up all over Red&#39;s shoes.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s good stuff.
 <br>
 - No, it&#39;s not good stuff.
 <br>
 And you know what else? It&#39;s forbidden.
 <br>
 So, what, are you trying to play father now? I&#39;m not playing.
 <br>
 I am your father.
 <br>
 You wanna stay here, you&#39;re gonna do what I tell you.
 <br>
 - Oh, really? - Yeah, really! I&#39;ll be damned if you&#39;re gonna end up looking for your own foot on my watch! Now, clean up all this crap, take the trash out and eat a banana, dumb-ass! Now he&#39;s all strict.
 <br>
 I gotta do my homework and he keeps talking about nutrition.
 <br>
 [Sighs] So, I guess what I&#39;m hearing from all this is Hyde loves his daddy! - Shut up, Forman.
 <br>
 I do not.
 <br>
 - Yes, you do! Yes, you do! - And Daddy loves his little Hyde! - [Scoffs] And that&#39;s why he yells at him and tucks him into bed and puts on his little footsie pajamas and reads him bedtime stories! [Grunting, Muttering] Hey, thanks, Steven.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take over from here.
 <br>
 - Now, about last night- - You know what, Dad? Uh, before you get started, I know what you&#39;re gonna say.
 <br>
 Oh, really? What do you know? Um, that I was irresponsible and stupid.
 <br>
 And I have it on good authority that I may have called you something.
 <br>
 Like, um, &#34;big, bald party pooper?&#34; For instance.
 <br>
 But the point is, Dad, I&#39;m really ashamed and sorry and afraid.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, that covers it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Good talk.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it? I get off scot-free? I mean, I learned a valuable lesson? Look, Son, you&#39;re grown up now.
 <br>
 You know what you did wrong.
 <br>
 And I am too tired to keep thinking up new and exciting ways to punish you.
 <br>
 So- Merry Christmas.
 <br>
 Are you kidding me? I don&#39;t get in trouble, and you&#39;re giving me a Christmas present? Oh, boy, this is the best Christmas ever! [Sniffs] Actually, you know, this really smells.
 <br>
 Yeah, those are my shoes from last night.
 <br>
 Clean &#39;em, buff&#39;em and shine &#39;em.
 <br>
 Ho, ho, ho.
 <br>
 Dumb-ass! Damn.
 <br>
 Damn it! Oh, come on! [Shouts]
