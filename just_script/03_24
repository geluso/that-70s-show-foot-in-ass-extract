<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Okay, here comes Kelso.
 <br>
 Oh, this is going to be so good.
 <br>
 But plug your nose, because it&#39;s also going to be foul.
 <br>
 - All right, somebody put a stink bomb in my backpack! - Oh! And when I find out who, I&#39;m gonna kick some ass! Why must people be cruel? Yeah, &#39;cause now I gotta go seeJackie smelling like a skunk.
 <br>
 And Jackie hates skunks, except for Pep√© le Pew.
 <br>
 And, you gotta admit, for a skunk, he&#39;s pretty romantic.
 <br>
 Okay, guys, I&#39;ve got five stink bombs left.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go ruin someone else&#39;s day.
 <br>
 Sorry, guys.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to the movies with Donna.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we hardly see each other, now that she got that job at the radio station.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re the wife of a famous radio personality.
 <br>
 Go bake me a pie, Martha.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s on the radio.
 <br>
 She&#39;s doing the farm report right now.
 <br>
 [Switching Channels] [Donna] And in pork belly news prices have risen to nearly Mmm-mmm, bacon! Pork belly prices.
 <br>
 How cute is that? And I&#39;ll be back at 3:00, 4:00 and 5:00 with more uPdates.
 <br>
 Until then, keep on farmin&#39;.
 <br>
 Is that okay? I just added that.
 <br>
 I did hit the button.
 <br>
 - Oh! - [Rock] She&#39;s staying late again? Oh, God.
 <br>
 How much fast-breaking pork belly news can there possibly be? That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m goin&#39; down there.
 <br>
 - Well, that conversation&#39;s going to go badly.
 <br>
 - How do you know? I put a stink bomb in his back pocket.
 <br>
 You&#39;re doin&#39; the rest of the farm reports? Come on.
 <br>
 I thought we were goin&#39; to the movies.
 <br>
 Well, Janice called in sick, so- Why do you smell like butt? That is none of your business, okay? Okay, Donna, look.
 <br>
 I think we need to talk.
 <br>
 I think this job is really cutting into your Eric time.
 <br>
 My &#34;Eric time&#34;? And I&#39;m very concerned about your diminishing Eric time because it directly affects me, you know.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Eric.
 <br>
 Hey, thanks for staying late again, Donna.
 <br>
 You know, you might just turn this into a full-time gig.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;m her full-time gig.
 <br>
 No offense.
 <br>
 You stink, dude.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s those tickets.
 <br>
 Enjoy the show.
 <br>
 - Tickets? - I know I&#39;ve been working a lot lately.
 <br>
 I wanted to make it up to you, so I got Max to hook us up with Ted Nugent tickets for everybody! The Motor City Madman? No way! Oh, my disappointment is melting into a mixture of excitement and guilt.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I was going for.
 <br>
 - Oh! Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! As soon as I saw that skunk, I knew that I had to caPture it and return it to the zoo where it could maybe, just maybe fall in love like you and I.
 <br>
 - Oh! Michael, that is so sweet.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s me- sweet.
 <br>
 So, here we are.
 <br>
 What to do.
 <br>
 What to do.
 <br>
 Oh, I know what we can do.
 <br>
 It.
 <br>
 No, Michael, I&#39;m not doing &#34;it&#34; in a car.
 <br>
 Now that we&#39;re back together, I want it to be special.
 <br>
 I want our second first time to be magical.
 <br>
 I can do magic.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 Hmm? Hmm? Michael, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 Jackie, I just removed a finger! [Laughing] All right, how about this? We&#39;ll have a special day just dedicated to all the romantic magic you want.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a great idea.
 <br>
 But you know what would be even better? If we did it right now? No! That instead of one day we have a whole week of romantic magic.
 <br>
 Well, that would be seven times longer.
 <br>
 And seven times better.
 <br>
 And seven times longer.
 <br>
 Yea.
 <br>
 You know, our anniversary&#39;s comin&#39; up.
 <br>
 Eighteen years.
 <br>
 I can still remember the first time I saw Midgie.
 <br>
 She was the tallest girl in chemistry class.
 <br>
 And Bob was the shortest boy.
 <br>
 But what he lacked in height, he made up for in shortness.
 <br>
 Red, um, remember when we first met? Like it was yesterday.
 <br>
 [Big Band] It was 1952 at a U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Dance.
 <br>
 Me and my buddies were blowin&#39;off steam.
 <br>
 And, suddenly, I saw her.
 <br>
 She was the most beautiful girl in thejoint.
 <br>
 Hiya, dame.
 <br>
 Wanna shake a leg? No, thanks.
 <br>
 - It wasn&#39;t a question.
 <br>
 - I think it was, mister.
 <br>
 Mind if I cut in? It&#39;s none of your business, bell-bottom.
 <br>
 I think you could use a little punch, leatherneck.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re in big trouble, Red Forman.
 <br>
 Huh? I said, you&#39;re in big trouble, Red Forman.
 <br>
 You&#39;re thinking of some other girl.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not how we met at all.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Oh! Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Fez, what&#39;s in the box? Counterfeit concert T-shirts.
 <br>
 Me and Hyde are going to sell them after the show.
 <br>
 Oh, how entrepreneurial of you.
 <br>
 You see, I figure with the original concert T&#39;s going for $15 we sell ours for 10, I turn a $50 investment into 250 bucks.
 <br>
 Where&#39;d you get 50 bucks? I thought you were broke.
 <br>
 I sneaked it from your Candy Land stash.
 <br>
 So if you think about it, it&#39;s all profit.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Can I borrow $50? Hey, you wanna see what Fez! It&#39;s &#34;Ted&#34; Nugent! Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Tad Nugent.
 <br>
 No, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m saying &#34;Ted.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;m saying Tad too.
 <br>
 - No, you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 It says &#34;Tad.
 <br>
 &#34; - I know it says &#34;Tad.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;m the one who put it on there.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re fighting.
 <br>
 What&#39;s the problem here? Because the shirt says &#34;Tad.
 <br>
 &#34; Exactly.
 <br>
 - But the &#34;A&#34; should be an &#34;E.
 <br>
 &#34; - That&#39;s not how you spell &#34;Tad.
 <br>
 &#34; No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how you spell &#34;Ted.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh.
 <br>
 These shirts are useless.
 <br>
 Now Forman&#39;s out 50 bucks.
 <br>
 [Cheering, Shouting] You know, it&#39;s hard enough trying to remember this without you two staring at me.
 <br>
 Hey, I could hypnotize you.
 <br>
 I know! You could retrace your steps.
 <br>
 What did you have for breakfast? Oh, hi, Kitty.
 <br>
 Uh, you know I was just thinking about how much I love you.
 <br>
 - So, you remember yet? - Yes! No.
 <br>
 It was November 17, 1953 at a U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Dance.
 <br>
 I remember because it was the most important moment of my life! Really, Kitty? Because in November 1953 I was in Korea.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m pretty sure that you were talking to someone else.
 <br>
 Are you sure? Maybe-Maybe you came home for the weekend.
 <br>
 Not from Korea.
 <br>
 Oh, great.
 <br>
 Now, neither one of us knows how we met.
 <br>
 Well, you better get your thinking cap on, mister.
 <br>
 [Ted Nugent] Thank you, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Good night.
 <br>
 ! - That was the coolest, most bitchin&#39; concert! - That was so cool! - Totally! - That was cool.
 <br>
 All right, let&#39;s go try and sell these stupid T-shirts.
 <br>
 God, Michael, this was the most magical night.
 <br>
 You know, during the concert, I rewrote some ofTed Nugent&#39;s songs with your name in it.
 <br>
 Okay, which one do you like better &#34;Cat Scratch Jackie&#34; or &#34;Jackie Scratch Fever&#34;? I love them both! - What do you wanna do now? - Uh- Ooh! We can go around back and watch the tour buses from behind the chain-link fence.
 <br>
 - Great idea! - Hiya, kids.
 <br>
 Enjoy the show? Are you kidding? I&#39;m deaf! You can say that again, Max.
 <br>
 Well, you know, I&#39;m startin&#39; to come down.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;m getting tired.
 <br>
 Uh, why don&#39;t you take this? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 A backstage pass.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah! Oh, too bad there&#39;s only one, huh? I&#39;ll be back in five minutes, I swear.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re going? - Well, don&#39;t you want me to? Of course I do.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I said, &#34;Oh, you&#39;re going! Yea!&#34; You&#39;re the best! Yeah, that&#39;s-Yeah, that&#39;s good.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice for her.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll never see her again.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how I lost my first wife.
 <br>
 Damn you, Donny Osmond! T-shirts! Get your crappy, misspelled T-shirts! Can&#39;t enjoy the after-party without your crappy, misspelled T-shirts! I rue the day I took you under my wing, my foreign friend.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry you feel that way, Hyde but I think that the time we spended together has taught us each a little bit about tolerance humanity, friendship.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Ew! Michael, someone blew chunks.
 <br>
 May I escort you across the vomit, my lady? Why, thank you, good sir.
 <br>
 I hate them.
 <br>
 You just bought yourself a barfy Todd Nugent T-shirt, mister! Fez.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Ted! Hey, who ordered the redhead? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re looking at me.
 <br>
 Ted Nugent is looking at me.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 ! StoPlooking at me.
 <br>
 ! I&#39;m Donna.
 <br>
 I am, like, your biggest fan.
 <br>
 Hi, Donna.
 <br>
 Meet the other groupies.
 <br>
 This is Blonde Girl, the Other Blonde Girl Tall Girl, and the Tall Blonde Girl.
 <br>
 Well, actually, I&#39;m not a groupie.
 <br>
 I mean, I love you, but I work at a rock radio station.
 <br>
 WFPP, &#34;The Sound.
 <br>
 &#34; I do the farm report.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, like, a huge day for pork bellies.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 You work for a radio station? You wanna do an interview or somethin&#39;? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 An interview would be amazing.
 <br>
 Do you have, um, a piece of paper, one of those, uh- Pens.
 <br>
 Pens.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 You are the best.
 <br>
 Okay, first question.
 <br>
 Um- Uh- Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Why are you so great? Hey, guys, have you seen Donna? Look, Forman, no offense.
 <br>
 We got more important things to worry about here.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Good luck in jail, guys.
 <br>
 You know, I had a dream like this once.
 <br>
 Only I was handcuffed to Cheryl Tiegs and you weren&#39;t wearing your sunglasses.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not just tonight, you know.
 <br>
 Yeah, she&#39;s been blowing me off more and more.
 <br>
 And she thinks I&#39;ll take it, but I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 Uh-uh.
 <br>
 Can you lift your feet, please? Sorry.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not listenin&#39; to your little story so you really need to stop talkin&#39; to yourself.
 <br>
 What is wrong with you people? Come on! That was great! What, are you on dope? Oh.
 <br>
 Well, uh, I better go.
 <br>
 My boyfriend&#39;s waiting.
 <br>
 Thank you so much for the interview, Ted.
 <br>
 You&#39;re very welcome.
 <br>
 You wanna stick around? I&#39;ll let you touch the guitar.
 <br>
 Really? All right! Wait, you mean your guitar guitar, right? Yeah.
 <br>
 All right! Ooh! Michael, I have to say, this has really been a magically romantic day.
 <br>
 Actually, it&#39;s after midnight.
 <br>
 So it is now officially day two of magical romance week.
 <br>
 - Ta-da! - Oh, Michael! And I&#39;ve got some great stuff planned for the rest of the week.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna have a picnic, and I&#39;m gonna cook for you.
 <br>
 Oh, and we&#39;re gonna go for a ride on a rickshaw.
 <br>
 You know what? You are the most romantic man in Point Place.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 You know, at first, I thought this was gonna suck.
 <br>
 But now I&#39;ve really gotten into it and I&#39;m glad that we&#39;re waiting seven days to do it.
 <br>
 God, Michael, you really have changed.
 <br>
 You&#39;re so different.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re different.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 Now! Whoa.
 <br>
 L-I thought you didn&#39;t wanna do it in a car.
 <br>
 No, Michael, you&#39;re so irresistible, I can&#39;t wait.
 <br>
 What about the rest of the week? I mean, I rented a tux and patent leather shoes! [Knocking] Okay, you guys, come on.
 <br>
 Open up.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve had a really bad night.
 <br>
 We need the car, Eric.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna do it, and it&#39;s gonna be magical.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, it&#39;s killing me that I can&#39;t remember.
 <br>
 Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, me too.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ll tell you one thing I remember.
 <br>
 I remember that you loved Manhattans.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I used to drink.
 <br>
 Oh, I haven&#39;t had a Manhattan in 20 years.
 <br>
 Oh, boy, that takes me back.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh! Keep &#39;em coming.
 <br>
 Oh, my.
 <br>
 I&#39;m as loose as a goose.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 Upsy-daisy.
 <br>
 I need to use the ladies&#39;- [Gasps, Laughs] - You all right? - I bumped into your butt and fell down! Sorry.
 <br>
 My pants were, uh- [Clears Throat] Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Red Forman.
 <br>
 How do you do, Red Forman? I&#39;m Kitty Sigurdson.
 <br>
 You bumped into my butt and fell down? And that&#39;s how we met? I&#39;m afraid so.
 <br>
 Well, what do you say if Eric ever asks we go with the &#34;I punched out a marine&#34; story? And I wasn&#39;t drinking.
 <br>
 I was reading to the blind.
 <br>
 Sounds good.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, Eric.
 <br>
 I have so much to tell you.
 <br>
 I actually met Ted Nugent, and I got an interview.
 <br>
 And I know I said I&#39;d be right back, but- It was so exciting! Oh.
 <br>
 Yeah, my night too.
 <br>
 I met the janitor.
 <br>
 And then, I got to see Kelso take his pants off.
 <br>
 Rock and roll! Eric, you&#39;re mad at me for going backstage to meet Ted Nugent? No, no.
 <br>
 I&#39;m mad at you because you ditched me.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t ditch you.
 <br>
 This was Ted Nugent.
 <br>
 This was a huge opportunity for me.
 <br>
 So, come Monday, I don&#39;t have to just talk about the farm report.
 <br>
 I can talk about the interview, like an interviewer.
 <br>
 Well, you know what, Donna? All I can say is that my mom never would have bailed on my dad like that.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 But they&#39;re married.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, forget it.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just forget it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re sorry.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 I never said I was sorry.
 <br>
 But you are, right? I shouldn&#39;t have to be.
 <br>
 We are free! At last, we are free! Yeah.
 <br>
 They tried to charge us with selling counterfeit merchandise.
 <br>
 But since Ted Nugent was misspelled, it wasn&#39;t really counterfeit.
 <br>
 It was just stupid.
 <br>
 My ignorance of American youth culture finally paid off.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, did you get to meet the Nuge? Yeah, it was awesome.
 <br>
 I was right there with Ted Nugent.
 <br>
 The Nuge! So, can we go now? Excuse me! You&#39;re ruining the magic! You going to a clown funeral? Shut up! I&#39;m romantic.
 <br>
 - Nice rental, Kelso.
 <br>
 - Joke&#39;s on you.
 <br>
 I bought it.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 Well, I think you look handsome, Michael.
 <br>
 Thank you, Jackie.
 <br>
 Hey, Fez, you ever pull a rickshaw? What&#39;s a rickshaw? Come on.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun.
 <br>
 <br>
