 Eric Forman&#39;s Basement Midnight Eric&#39;s 18th Birthday And midnight.
 <br>
 So long 17, in the words of Alice Cooper I&#39;m 18 and I like it.
 <br>
 Happy birthday, Man.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s give him his present.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a case of 23 beers.
 <br>
 - Kelso? - I deserved one, I carried it.
 <br>
 Yeah that tastes like 18.
 <br>
 Whoa, check out the new stereo.
 <br>
 Oh it plays records and 8 tracks, this thing&#39;s like right out of the future.
 <br>
 Yeah Donna gave it to me.
 <br>
 I think she feels bad that she&#39;s going to college without me.
 <br>
 So on the one hand I&#39;m losing the girl that I&#39;ve been in love with since I was 5 but on the other hand I get a crappy stereo.
 <br>
 Score! What? I mean she&#39;s going to dump you eventually.
 <br>
 Rock and roll never dies.
 <br>
 Kelso, Donna and I are fine, okay? I mean, she&#39;s waiting until the very last bus to go to school tomorrow, so we can spend every minute of my birthday together.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just gonna make this work.
 <br>
 Eric, long distance relationships don&#39;t work.
 <br>
 Just ask my girlfriend back home.
 <br>
 Fez, you have a girlfriend back home? No, don&#39;t you listen? Long distance relationships don&#39;t work.
 <br>
 You guys, Donna and I are not gonna let a couple of miles come between us, okay? This isn&#39;t the end of the world.
 <br>
 My world is over, man.
 <br>
 Forman, I know what you&#39;re thinking.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s gonna go to school, meet a whole bunch of people way cooler than you and probably fall in love with someone else.
 <br>
 -And you don&#39;t think she will? - Oh, I know she will.
 <br>
 My advice to you is drink up.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s just leaving, y&#39;know? Hasn&#39;t she heard of a little something called sacrifice? Y&#39;know, she sacrifices an education, or a career, or a future of any kind, and in exchange she gets me.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t offer much in the way of excitement, but if it&#39;s the same old same old a girls after, look out.
 <br>
 I never deserved her anyway Well we&#39;re here for ya.
 <br>
 Here ya go, dry your eyes.
 <br>
 Thanks you guys, I feel better.
 <br>
 I think we all do.
 <br>
 Alright buddy, come on let&#39;s get you to bed.
 <br>
 Big boy lets tuck you in.
 <br>
 Alright, sleep tight buddy.
 <br>
 The next morning Oh good lord.
 <br>
 What, what? Happy birthday, dumbass.
 <br>
 That &#39;70s show Season 6 Episode 3 Magic Bus Okay Red, remember don&#39;t tire yourself out today, because tonight is a special night in the bedroom.
 <br>
 Bob Newhart&#39;s on Carson? No silly, it&#39;s been a month since your heart attack.
 <br>
 Tonight&#39;s the night the doctor gave us the okay.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know the okay.
 <br>
 Kitty I don&#39;t like clues, just say it.
 <br>
 - The okay to make love.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t say that.
 <br>
 Well tonight is my only night off this week.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not talk about it in front of the boy.
 <br>
 Or girl, or whatever he is today.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not talk about what in front of the boy? Ohhh, you guys are planning a surprise party for me tonight, aren&#39;t you? Well first of all, thank you.
 <br>
 Second of all let me just say, 18 years old, not too old for ice-cream cake, okay.
 <br>
 So where&#39;s my special birthday breakfast? Oh my goodness, I&#39;ve been so busy this morning I forgot all about your breakfast.
 <br>
 Okay I&#39;ll play along.
 <br>
 La de da, here I am, completely unaware that I&#39;m about to get my super birthday breakfast with 4 pieces of bacon.
 <br>
 - Honey, there is no breakfast.
 <br>
 - Mom gags over, gimmie the bacon.
 <br>
 Are you sure you want bacon? It&#39;s fattening.
 <br>
 You barely fit into your best dress as it is.
 <br>
 Eric honey, let me make it up to you.
 <br>
 How about tonight instead of hanging out around here you just you take the night off.
 <br>
 Oh, because there&#39;s &#39;no party&#39;.
 <br>
 I&#39;m with ya.
 <br>
 I&#39;m with you.
 <br>
 Steven I am so glad we&#39;re back together.
 <br>
 I thought I&#39;d lost my little Puddin&#39; Pop forever.
 <br>
 Wanna hear something sick? I actually missed you calling me Puddin&#39; Pop.
 <br>
 How many times have I told you guys not to make out on my bed? You guys are like cats, you don&#39;t even listen.
 <br>
 Down! You&#39;re leaving tonight so technically this isn&#39;t your bed anymore.
 <br>
 Besides, I just can&#39;t keep my hands off my Puddin&#39; Pop.
 <br>
 - Puddin&#39; Pop? - Puddin&#39; Pop? Is that supposed to be me? I&#39;ve never heard that name before in my life.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;re amazing.
 <br>
 Taking the midnight bus tonight, just so you can spend my whole birthday with me that I swear that is right up there with not wearing a bra in public.
 <br>
 Wow you&#39;re taking this really well.
 <br>
 Yeah well, I know I have a history of ruining these things.
 <br>
 Birthdays, holidays, that perm that made you look like a poodle.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not gonna do that okay? I&#39;m not gonna ruin our last day together.
 <br>
 Oh, so you&#39;re taking the toaster? What? Ah, it&#39;s just y&#39;know we bought it together, so I guess I kinda though it was like our toaster.
 <br>
 What do I know, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m the one going to college right? You are - with my toaster.
 <br>
 - Okay Eric if it&#39;s a problem - Oh, it&#39;s a problem.
 <br>
 You thought you could just sneak it out of town without telling me cause you knew it was wrong, didn&#39;t ya lady? Okay Eric, I don&#39;t know what your deal is, but you&#39;re ruining our last day together.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t be me if I didn&#39;t ruin it! You know what? Enjoy your toast, I hope it burns! Oh man, Casablanca.
 <br>
 This is the part where Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman they&#39;ll always have Paris.
 <br>
 What&#39;s his problem? The guy owns a bar, man.
 <br>
 he&#39;d be beating those French sluts off with a stick.
 <br>
 How&#39;d it go with Donna? I ruined it.
 <br>
 And I knew I was ruining it, while I was ruining it.
 <br>
 I just kept on ruining it.
 <br>
 Now Bogey y&#39;know that guy knows how to let a woman go.
 <br>
 &#34;Here&#39;s lookin&#39; at you Kid.
 <br>
 &#34; I threw a toaster.
 <br>
 Hey if you wanna be like Bogey you gotta let her go.
 <br>
 Only Bogey&#39;ll get another hot girl.
 <br>
 You, I see Star Wars conventions and fat chicks.
 <br>
 Hey, Bogey and I have more in common than you think.
 <br>
 Of all the teenage burger hangouts, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine, only to walk right back out again.
 <br>
 Play it Fez.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll cost you a Baby Ruth.
 <br>
 Now I want a Baby Ruth.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s go to the Hub.
 <br>
 - Uh, I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Let me see that.
 <br>
 Forman, I think there&#39;s a rule that when you turn 18 you can&#39;t let Scooby tell you the time anymore.
 <br>
 Shows what you know Hyde, that&#39;s Deputy Dawg.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t wait until all of Donna&#39;s giant clothes are out of the closet.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even go in there now.
 <br>
 I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll fall into one of her big shoes, and never be heard from again.
 <br>
 Well I guess I must be Eric&#39;s best friend, &#39;cause I&#39;m the only one took the trouble of getting him a birthday cake.
 <br>
 It&#39;s good too.
 <br>
 Maybe we should think about getting him something else.
 <br>
 What do you think, Puddin Pop? Why does everybody keep calling me that? My name&#39;s not Puddin&#39; Pop, I&#39;ve never heard that name before in my life.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 Hey if you guys think that&#39;s funny, you should hear what Steven calls me.
 <br>
 He calls me his Hey! Oh hey, that&#39;s some good cake.
 <br>
 So I heard Eric threw a toaster.
 <br>
 It&#39;s almost as bad as the time he called you a poodle head.
 <br>
 Which he brought up again today.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not good.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m just surprised Eric was able to lift the toaster.
 <br>
 Donna I&#39;ve been looking all over for you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry I was such a jerk earlier.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your last day, and it&#39;s my birthday I just I wanna spend it together.
 <br>
 Eric it&#39;s okay, I know you don&#39;t care about the toaster.
 <br>
 You&#39;re sad I&#39;m leaving and I&#39;m sad too.
 <br>
 Hey don&#39;t take him back, he threw a toaster.
 <br>
 Hey, shouldn&#39;t my surprise party have started already? We keep telling you there&#39;s no party man, it&#39;s like you&#39;re deaf.
 <br>
 Eric there is NO party.
 <br>
 No, no, no, why are you here? You can&#39;t be here.
 <br>
 Oh right, I&#39;ll go outside, then I&#39;ll come back, and you guys yell &#39;surprise!&#39; and I&#39;ll yell &#39;you got me!&#39; Eric honey, there&#39;s no party.
 <br>
 What? How can there not be a party? Mom, what is more important than your only son&#39;s 18th birthday? Okay fine.
 <br>
 For the first time since his heart attack your father and I are having intercourse.
 <br>
 Sexy Okay let&#39;s get this over with.
 <br>
 Happy birthday.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t friggin&#39; believe my Mom didn&#39;t plan a friggin&#39; party on my 18th friggin&#39; birthday.
 <br>
 The only party going on in this house is in their bedroom, and that&#39;s all ugh! Forman, you hate it when your Mom does stuff for your birthday.
 <br>
 Remember 2 years ago? I&#39;m 16.
 <br>
 Hey, your mother worked very hard on this party, now you be nice to her or we&#39;re cancelling the puppet show.
 <br>
 Oh sit on the tiny horse, so I can take a picture.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t mom I&#39;ll kill it Yeah okay, fine but she should have done something for me.
 <br>
 Well we&#39;re here for ya.
 <br>
 We scraped together a few bucks and got you something you can actually use.
 <br>
 What is it? It&#39;s a knob for your new stereo.
 <br>
 Wait, did you guys just take this off while I wasn&#39;t looking? Eric, there&#39;s an old saying.
 <br>
 &#39;Don&#39;t look a gift horse in the knob&#39;.
 <br>
 And what happened to my Led Zeppelin 8 track? You mean gift number 2.
 <br>
 Well hello handsome.
 <br>
 Boy am I tired.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;ll just go to bed.
 <br>
 Red Forman what has gotten into you? I just think that there are more appropriate ways for us to spend our time.
 <br>
 Like you knit and I&#39;ll whittle.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a nice life.
 <br>
 Red, I know what this is about.
 <br>
 You&#39;re afraid of getting physical so soon after your heart attack.
 <br>
 Kitty, you know I love what we do.
 <br>
 Am I willing to die for it? Now you just relax, nurse Kitty is here to take care of you.
 <br>
 Well, big paw&#39;s on the 11 so it&#39;s almost time to take Donna to the bus station.
 <br>
 This is it you guys, she&#39;s really going away.
 <br>
 Forman, we have just the thing to make you feel better.
 <br>
 Psst.
 <br>
 Another case of beer! Oh, I&#39;m just not really in the mood to put on a dress.
 <br>
 But thanks anyway Puddin&#39; Pop.
 <br>
 Aw! Look man, if you want her to stay, can&#39;t you just ask her to stay? You have no idea how badly I wanna do that but I just, - I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be fair to her.
 <br>
 - Fair to her? Who cares what the woman thinks? This is America.
 <br>
 I already screwed this up once today, I am not gonna screw this up again.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna fight every bad instinct I have, and I&#39;m just gonna let her go.
 <br>
 Like Bogey did in Casablanca.
 <br>
 Wait so that&#39;s it? Nobody&#39;s gonna drink beer and put on a dress? Hey Fez, you wanna beer? Sure Jackie! What did you do to my room? Your room? Uh, read the wall Donna.
 <br>
 Jackie, this is still my room until I leave, so will you get out and give me and Eric a few minutes alone? But I still have to paint the heart over the &#39;I&#39; - Out, shoo.
 <br>
 - Oh God, alright Donna! Okay you&#39;re all packed.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe my baby&#39;s leaving.
 <br>
 Well hey, I&#39;ll still be around, sir.
 <br>
 Why would I wanna pal around with you? All you did was dirty her up.
 <br>
 You should probably get going.
 <br>
 Happy birthday, Eric.
 <br>
 Donna this is the nicest thing anyone&#39;s done for me all day.
 <br>
 Make a wish.
 <br>
 Oh boy, do I smell cupcakes? So I&#39;m really gonna miss you.
 <br>
 Yeah me too.
 <br>
 Donna I&#39;m really happy for you.
 <br>
 Well, bye I guess.
 <br>
 Donna wait! - Donna you have to stay.
 <br>
 - Stay? You&#39;re supposed to tell me to go.
 <br>
 No if you leave you&#39;ll regret it.
 <br>
 Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but in a couple of weeks or at least by Christmas.
 <br>
 Oh my God, you&#39;re such a loser.
 <br>
 - Donna - Here&#39;s looking at you, dork.
 <br>
 What did you wanna tell me? Have a safe trip.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Donna, what? I couldn&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 I couldn&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 This whole time I was thinking I was supposed to leave, and then when the time came to get on the bus, I couldn&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll figure college out later, all I know is I wanna stay here with you.
 <br>
 Oh my God, Donna.
 <br>
 that&#39;s what I wished for.
 <br>
 Donna we didn&#39;t get a chance to say goodbye.
 <br>
 Did you guys get him drunk and make him wear a dress? Yes, but I&#39;ve been wanting to do this for sometime.
 <br>
 To tired? Yeah that was pretty silly.
 <br>
 Knit and Whittle? Yeah I hate to whittle.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s the aspirin? Oh like you&#39;ve never woken up in a dress before?
 <br>
