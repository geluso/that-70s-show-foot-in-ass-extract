<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Well, you&#39;re awfully happy.
 <br>
 We&#39;re having a cocktail party.
 <br>
 What&#39;s not to be happy about? Red, the last time we had a party, you called the cops and had them tow everyone&#39;s car.
 <br>
 Drunk people looking for their cars.
 <br>
 That was funny.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re just giddy because Bob&#39;s bringing his pretty new girlfriend over.
 <br>
 Oh, Kitty, don&#39;t be ridiculous.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just happy.
 <br>
 Now why do you want to ruin my happiness? Because that&#39;s what a wife does.
 <br>
 You know, my dad dating your mom goes against all the laws of nature.
 <br>
 I mean, you don&#39;t see a giraffe with a panda bear.
 <br>
 You know, my dad being the cute, fuzzy panda bear, and your mom being the evil, money-hungry unnaturally tan giraffe.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve had it with them, too.
 <br>
 Last night your dad burped in front of my mom, and she laughed, Donna.
 <br>
 Laughed! Okay, we&#39;re Burkharts.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t burp, and we don&#39;t tolerate people who do.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody, I brought a date.
 <br>
 Look how tall she is.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like I&#39;m dating the statue of liberty.
 <br>
 Oh, Kitty, I just love coming over to your house.
 <br>
 You have such unique tastes.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like being at a giant flea market.
 <br>
 And like at every flea market, Bob&#39;s gonna leave with the tackiest thing here.
 <br>
 Pam, come on in.
 <br>
 I made your favorite drink Tequila sunrise.
 <br>
 Red, always the gentleman.
 <br>
 Yeah, well Red, Red, honey, where&#39;s my favorite drink? I didn&#39;t know you had a favorite drink, Kitty, seeing as how much you like all drinks.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take a drink, Red.
 <br>
 Beer&#39;s in the garage, Bob.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Burkhart? That&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 Golly, I didn&#39;t know you were dropping by.
 <br>
 Yeah, you did.
 <br>
 I told you she was, and you said, &#34;oh, boy, I&#39;m gonna wear my suit.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, I&#39;m sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 Is there some kind of law against being handsome? Because if there is, then guilty as charged.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Burkhart, when did you get here? Is it too much for you people to let me know that we have company? One bronzed-up tart in the room, and all the men turn into a bunch of oversexed fraternity boys.
 <br>
 Kitty, you&#39;re just imagining things.
 <br>
 What&#39;s she wearing? Oh, I cannot believe you kids, trying to sneak off with my good gin.
 <br>
 Yeah, I shoulda known.
 <br>
 She can smell booze from a mile away.
 <br>
 Excuse me? Oh, I said, &#34;you smell like booze from a mile away.
 <br>
 &#34; That&#39;s worse, dumb-ass! Oh, what a lovely evening.
 <br>
 if I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d swear I was with rich people.
 <br>
 She&#39;s got it all Looks and beauty.
 <br>
 Pam, you want another drink? Honey, you shouldn&#39;t be drinking.
 <br>
 You have a doctor&#39;s appointment tomorrow.
 <br>
 He has a heart condition.
 <br>
 He&#39;s very old.
 <br>
 I never thought I&#39;d say this, but I wish I was Bob.
 <br>
 I wonder if she&#39;d like to watch &#34;the graduate&#34; with me some night.
 <br>
 One time back when I was dating Jackie, Pam was trying to wash her car, right, and she leaned over and, like, squeezed out the sponge.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all I remember, cause I rode my bike straight into a tree.
 <br>
 Oh, look at her.
 <br>
 Would you ever want me to show that much leg? Absolutely not.
 <br>
 And why not? You set me up.
 <br>
 Jackie, I can&#39;t see your mom&#39;s hand, which means it&#39;s on my dad&#39;s butt.
 <br>
 We have to break &#39;em up.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been bad-mouthing Pinciottis for years.
 <br>
 I can be one.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s when I realized that &#34;tapas&#34; sounds a lot like &#34;topless.
 <br>
 &#34; But I had already promised, so Hey, mrs.
 <br>
 Burkhart, why don&#39;t I throw on some music for us to, uh Shake our booties to? Hey, stop acting like an ass in front of the pretty lady.
 <br>
 That&#39;s ok, Red.
 <br>
 I think he&#39;s cute.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, he is my son, you know.
 <br>
 Well, good party, good party.
 <br>
 When Pam and I were dancing, she, uh, &#34;accidentally&#34; brushed my butt.
 <br>
 And tell &#39;em what happened after that.
 <br>
 Well, then I said, &#34;hey, you can squeeze my butt anytime.
 <br>
 &#34; And then it got really quiet.
 <br>
 And then she walked over to Bob, and they were talking and pointing at me.
 <br>
 Then you tried to laugh it off, and you spit dip up on your shirt.
 <br>
 Then you tried to do that joke where you scoop the dip off your shirt with a chip, and none laughed, and here we are.
 <br>
 You know, there&#39;s a lot of talk about Pam, but, Eric, I still have feelings for your mom.
 <br>
 I mean, she comes off all pure, but she&#39;s dirty.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t my dad just see that Pam is a total gold digger? Oh, would you stop saying that? Hey, either she digs for gold or she doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 It&#39;s easy to check.
 <br>
 Are her boots muddy? Does she carry a pickax? When she comes home does she say, &#34;tough day at the gold mine&#34;? No, Fez, a gold digger is what these idiots call a woman who knows that love eventually wears off, but money is forever.
 <br>
 You guys, all I know is pretty tan lady touched my butt.
 <br>
 And that is more action than I&#39;ve gotten in weeks.
 <br>
 Keep it up, and you&#39;ll be having sex with yourself.
 <br>
 I mean, how does Bob pull all these foxes like Midge and Pam? He&#39;s got to have something the ladies can&#39;t resist.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna, you ever see your dad naked? My God! Can we please talk about anything besides that? You&#39;re way off, Hyde.
 <br>
 Women love Bob for his sense of humor.
 <br>
 That sucker&#39;s funnier than a dixie cup.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 All right, how it works is relationships are based on a point system.
 <br>
 All right, see, Pam is good looking.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s 20 points.
 <br>
 And Bob, he&#39;s, like, the nicest guy in the world, so that&#39;s, like, what, a point? But Bob&#39;s got money, and that&#39;s 19 points.
 <br>
 And altogether, that&#39;s 20.
 <br>
 Now you add the whole thing together, and that&#39;s 40, Which is incidentally almost half my score.
 <br>
 ? I don&#39;t care what that doctor says.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not wearing this stupid heart monitor.
 <br>
 It makes me look like a damn robot.
 <br>
 Red, I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t even know it&#39;s there.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll only beep if your heart rate goes above normal, like when you get agitated or excited or extra angry or extra happy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m putting my money on extra angry.
 <br>
 I bet the damn thing doesn&#39;t even work.
 <br>
 You know what, Red? Your attitude stinks.
 <br>
 You wouldn&#39;t be in this mess if you&#39;d just listened to me in the first place.
 <br>
 Kitty I told you to eat more fiber in the mornings.
 <br>
 I told you to exercise, to wear more comfortable shoes for circulation.
 <br>
 Did you listen? No.
 <br>
 So I guess I&#39;m just gonna keep telling you and telling you and telling you.
 <br>
 What do you know? It does work.
 <br>
 ? Hey, I can&#39;t believe you guys aren&#39;t in Bob&#39;s hot tub.
 <br>
 You know, I feel like Warren Beatty in a movie about a hot tub.
 <br>
 He&#39;s, like, hot tubbin&#39;, then, like Other stuff happens.
 <br>
 Kelso, just so you know, Bob was in there an hour ago, so you are, like, covered in hot, bubbly Bob.
 <br>
 Dad, will you please listen to us? We talked about it, and we really think you need to break up with Pam.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Open your eyes! Everyone can see what a big mistake this is.
 <br>
 Oh, so everyone here thinks I should just break up with Pam? I say stick with her, Bob.
 <br>
 My only advice is take pictures, otherwise no one&#39;s gonna believe you.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t listen to him.
 <br>
 He grew up poor.
 <br>
 He&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 What do you think, Eric? Yeah, Eric, what do you think? I hope it&#39;s the right answer.
 <br>
 You love that woman for all she&#39;s worth, Bob! Eric! What are you gonna do, cut me off from sex again? I agree with Forman, Bob.
 <br>
 I think you should keep her.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re you, and you&#39;re getting me-quality girls.
 <br>
 You&#39;re living life Kelso-style.
 <br>
 Enjoy.
 <br>
 Oh, I am so sorry I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 I locked my keys in the car, and I had to use a coat hanger to jimmy the lock.
 <br>
 I had to reach down in there, and I had to shimmy and shimmy and shimmy until the darn thing finally popped open.
 <br>
 Boy, I&#39;m sorry I missed that.
 <br>
 Yeah, could act it out for us one more time? Look, mom, Donna and I decided that you two can&#39;t see each other anymore.
 <br>
 We&#39;re your children, and we love you, but your happiness is much less important than ours.
 <br>
 Jackie, when your dad went away to jail, I decided to do some work on myself.
 <br>
 Not on the outside, obviously, because, well, come on.
 <br>
 But on the inside, you know, the part that doesn&#39;t matter as much.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ve realized that I need a man who makes me feel good about myself.
 <br>
 I need you Bob.
 <br>
 Aww, you know, if an ugly woman said that, it just wouldn&#39;t mean as much.
 <br>
 Man, if this was a movie, Pam would pick up Bob and just carry him off to a better life.
 <br>
 If this were a good movie, Pam would have entered the scene topless.
 <br>
 Yeah, if this were a great movie, they&#39;d have a monkey friend that did all this crazy stuff.
 <br>
 You know what? You guys were no help.
 <br>
 You could have backed us up.
 <br>
 And you could be sleeping with me.
 <br>
 People could be doing a lot of things.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;m done peeing.
 <br>
 Hey, can you hand me my clothes? Kelso, are you naked? No.
 <br>
 Eric, could you hand me my clothes, please? I&#39;m sorry, buddy.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t hear you over the hot tub.
 <br>
 Did you hear him, Hyde? I think so.
 <br>
 I think he said to take his clothes and run away.
 <br>
 Oooh.
 <br>
 Guys, guys, come back! Well, looks like I&#39;m gonna have to be nude in front of you guys, and that&#39;s kind of awkward.
 <br>
 So I think you ladies should nude up.
 <br>
 ? Okay, good news, Red.
 <br>
 I made your favorite lunch Lasagna! Thanks.
 <br>
 &#34;thanks&#34;? Aren&#39;t you excited? Let&#39;s hear that monitor! So every time you do something nice for me, I&#39;m supposed to have a heart attack? Well, no, not an attack.
 <br>
 Just a little episode.
 <br>
 Ha ha ha ha! I mean, what does it take to get that beeper going? Hi, Red.
 <br>
 Wow, that must be the lasagna kicking in.
 <br>
 Hey, what do you say we have some more of that lasagna? Boy, was that delicious.
 <br>
 Beep! Beep! Beep! Oh, can it, Red.
 <br>
 When Pam showed up, your heart monitor went off like a freakin&#39; slot machine.
 <br>
 Pam had nothing to do with that thing going off, Damn it! Oh, and look at us now.
 <br>
 We&#39;re arguing.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t even get a beep out of you.
 <br>
 Your son is a jerk.
 <br>
 Come on, I am gonna prove to you that I am not attracted to Pam.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m having a war flashback.
 <br>
 I&#39;m messed up, Kitty.
 <br>
 I&#39;m real messed up.
 <br>
 I cannot believe you told my dad to stay with Pam.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t even like you.
 <br>
 She told my dad you groped her at the party.
 <br>
 Okay, look, Donna, you and Pam obviously have some serious issues.
 <br>
 I think you two should work them out with a good old-fashioned pillow fight.
 <br>
 Come on, Jackie, I think maybe you should throw on a nightgown and defend your mom.
 <br>
 You&#39;re sick.
 <br>
 And, you, you were no help either.
 <br>
 Hey, I was just agreeing with Forman, so he didn&#39;t look so bad.
 <br>
 You said it before he did.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah What&#39;s the big deal? Bob and Pam are adults who want to do what comes naturally to everybody except me.
 <br>
 So I say, why can&#39;t I get any? You know, Pam wants to be with my dad now, but what happens when someone else comes along? I wouldn&#39;t care so much if I could just, you know, test her with a hotter guy and see if she falls for him.
 <br>
 Because I love you, I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 Why would you do it? This is a man&#39;s job.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t wait up for me, baby.
 <br>
 Ohh! No, it has to be someone her type.
 <br>
 Well, I know from her time in Mexico that she has a weakness for young, dark-skinned guys.
 <br>
 I guess I can ask around.
 <br>
 Mmm, that smells delicious.
 <br>
 What is it? It&#39;s not for you.
 <br>
 You can go look for scraps around the neighborhood like the rest of the dogs.
 <br>
 Kitty, for the last time, I am not attracted to Pam.
 <br>
 Please, believe me, as the husband who has shared your laughter and tears for Many happy years.
 <br>
 How many years, Red? All of &#39;em.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t give me a number, can you? Well, I can tell you on a scale of one to ten, I love you ten.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a number.
 <br>
 Oh, why don&#39;t you just take your cardiac jukebox over to Pam&#39;s? Hi, Kitty.
 <br>
 Hi, Red.
 <br>
 I thought we&#39;d come over and see if you two wanted to catch a movie.
 <br>
 Why are you staring? Too pretty for Wisconsin? I get that a lot.
 <br>
 You shut it off, didn&#39;t you? No, I did not shut it off! Let&#39;s hustle it up.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to sit behind people with hats.
 <br>
 Ha! Look at that, nosey! It&#39;s not Pam.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Bob, because he annoys me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 I do.
 <br>
 What are you guys talking about? Um Ha ha ha ha! I, um, I sort of thought that Red had a crush on you.
 <br>
 Oh, Kitty, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 This face can bring as much trouble as it does joy.
 <br>
 Well, Kitty, what do you have to say for yourself? It&#39;s the menopause.
 <br>
 I&#39;m messed up, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;m real messed up.
 <br>
 ? Um, hello.
 <br>
 What are you doing? I was hired to clean the hot tub.
 <br>
 But you should know that I, uh Perform other services, too.
 <br>
 Well, you could start by doing a better job.
 <br>
 It&#39;s still dirty.
 <br>
 So you like it dirty? No, I want it clean.
 <br>
 So you like it filthy? Bob! Whoa, I&#39;m not into that! No.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric, that was a good burn stealing my clothes.
 <br>
 But the laugh&#39;s on you, &#39;cause I borrowed your pants, and I&#39;m not wearing any underwear.
 <br>
 Kelso, just so you know, the last time I wore those pants, I wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear.
 <br>
 Ouch.
 <br>
 Well-played.
 <br>
 Where the hell is Fez? He should have been back by now.
 <br>
 Oh, I swear, if he touched my mother inappropriately, he is never borrowing my curling iron again.
 <br>
 Man, first I wanted to be Bob.
 <br>
 Now I wish I was Fez.
 <br>
 What the hell is going on this week? Ahem.
 <br>
 Did you tell Fez to make a move on Pam? &#39;cause if you didn&#39;t, I&#39;m gonna box him up and send him back to banana town.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m sick of those comments.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t say I&#39;m gonna send you back to polyester town.
 <br>
 Dad, I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 It was just the only thing we could think of to prove that Pam doesn&#39;t, you know, really care about you.
 <br>
 Well, guess what.
 <br>
 She does really care about me, so you can stop playing these little games, because Pam makes me happier than I have been in a long time.
 <br>
 You better accept it soon, &#39;cause she&#39;s here to stay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I will have my pretty lady.
 <br>
 This Bob is back.
 <br>
 Way to go, Bob! I love you, man! Bob, you&#39;re just like me.
 <br>
 We give regular guys hope.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t leave Pam, because Because Pam&#39;s your Donna.
 <br>
 Steven, am I your Donna? That doesn&#39;t apply to us.
 <br>
 We&#39;re both good-looking.
 <br>
 Dad, can we at least talk about this? I&#39;m sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the way it&#39;s gonna be.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want to talk about it anymore.
 <br>
 Should&#39;ve known this wasn&#39;t gonna work.
 <br>
 Foreigners never finish the job.
 <br>
 Oh, please, if Bob hadn&#39;t shown up, I&#39;d be your stepdaddy right now.
 <br>
 B-7.
 <br>
 Miss.
 <br>
 Oh, man, how do I keep missing you? It&#39;s &#39;cause I don&#39;t have any boats on there.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that noise? It&#39;s my dad&#39;s heart monitor.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your mom? She&#39;s with him.
 <br>
 Oh, take off the beeper! Other people live here!
 <br>
