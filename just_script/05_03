<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Whatever.
 <br>
 Whatever.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Yeah, like I care.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll talk to you later,Jackie.
 <br>
 Ew.
 <br>
 Do you mind not getting all gooey and romantic when I&#39;m about to eat my breakfast? What crawled up your butt? You and Jackie.
 <br>
 Then you started making out in there.
 <br>
 Hey! No more butt talk at breakfast.
 <br>
 Look, if you&#39;re not gonna break up with Jackie then you have to tell Kelso, okay? - It&#39;s like the ethical thing to do.
 <br>
 - Thank you,Johnny Cub Scout.
 <br>
 What are you gonna do, take away my friendship merit badge? No, because Cub Scouts are awarded achievement beads.
 <br>
 Badges.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - So, anybody hungry? - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Yeah, that sounds good.
 <br>
 - Starved! Ladies first.
 <br>
 Or ladies only.
 <br>
 Oh, well, um- well, it&#39;s not all for me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m eating for two now.
 <br>
 - ( Red, Hyde, Eric ) What? - I&#39;m pregnant.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 No! I mean, great.
 <br>
 ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) Kitty, are you sure you&#39;re-you&#39;re pregnant? Maybe you&#39;re just puttin&#39; on your winter weight.
 <br>
 Red, a woman knows.
 <br>
 Not to mention I&#39;m late.
 <br>
 And not for work.
 <br>
 For my menstrual cycle.
 <br>
 Hooray! That is great news, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Now, you stay away from those smokes.
 <br>
 If you smoke when you&#39;re pregnant, they come out all spindly.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 Mom, congratulations.
 <br>
 This is awesome.
 <br>
 Please, love me the most.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re sure being quiet over there, Red.
 <br>
 I&#39;m soaking in the moment.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I-I know this is unexpected but I just think it&#39;s gonna bring us so much happiness, don&#39;t you? Sure.
 <br>
 You know how much I love babies.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Oh, what a day.
 <br>
 I am so happy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just- I&#39;m just gonna go throw up.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t understand how this could have happened.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;s about time we had &#39;&#39;the talk.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; You see, when a boy loves a girl- - Doesn&#39;t have to love her.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Anyhoo,&#39;&#39; the boy&#39;s sexual organ- Hey! Shut it, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 That kid&#39;s gonna love it here.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re having a baby.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re still having sex.
 <br>
 I mean, my Dad&#39;s back goes out if you look at him wrong.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s why she was probably on top.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 You just killed a part of me.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why you got to put on your raincoat every damn time.
 <br>
 Well, except for the first time.
 <br>
 Free pass! No, Kelso, that&#39;s just a myth.
 <br>
 You&#39;re only safe if you do it underwater.
 <br>
 Right, Hyde? That&#39;s right, buddy.
 <br>
 Oops.
 <br>
 Oh, a little help, Donna.
 <br>
 - Sure.
 <br>
 - Oh, nice! Catch this, tool! - What was that for? - You keep dropping the ball.
 <br>
 Well, so I&#39;m a butterfingers.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that punishment enough? Now look.
 <br>
 The ball&#39;s all the way over there in the backyard.
 <br>
 Little help, Donna.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) God! Fine, I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 God! Hey, Steven.
 <br>
 I had fun last night.
 <br>
 - You had fun doing what? - Huh? Hey, Michael.
 <br>
 Um, I went to the movies.
 <br>
 Right, Donna? Oh, um, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I was with Eric all night.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m really interested in this movie.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you tell us all about it? Donna? Fine.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s that new movie starring that big, red whore.
 <br>
 Oh, you mean, the one where the big, red whore is sick of people keeping secrets.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 The one where the big, red whore keeps sticking her big, red nose in places where it doesn&#39;t belong.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Watch what you say about the big, red whore.
 <br>
 Thank you, Eric.
 <br>
 What did Sissy Spacek ever do to any of you? Way to go, guys.
 <br>
 You know how he feels about Sissy! Fez, wait! Donna, what is with you? Look, I&#39;m sick of covering for your creepy, unnatural relationship.
 <br>
 And I shouldn&#39;t have to.
 <br>
 I mean, Hyde, you and Kelso have been friends forever, and you owe it to him to tell him.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is way worse than when you stole his headgear and used it to clean out your sink.
 <br>
 It&#39;s tough love, man.
 <br>
 You know what? Forget it.
 <br>
 You obviously don&#39;t care about Kelso or any of the rest of us.
 <br>
 Yeah, &#39;cause when this blows up, guess what.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all screwed.
 <br>
 Steven, do you really think we&#39;re a creepy, unnatural couple? Come on.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a crazy question.
 <br>
 I mean, if this relationship wasn&#39;t just a little bit creepy and unnatural I wouldn&#39;t be in it.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, look.
 <br>
 Your little, pink baby sweater.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, and the matching pink bonnet.
 <br>
 Um, had they explained to you yet that I was a boy? Oh, I am just so excited about this baby.
 <br>
 Well, yeah.
 <br>
 You should be.
 <br>
 And Dad should be too.
 <br>
 What&#39;s with him anyway? Oh, no.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just his way.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 When I first told him about you he said, &#39;&#39;Oh, crap!&#39;&#39; and stormed out.
 <br>
 But then he came back happy as a clam.
 <br>
 And then, of course, when you got older, he got mad again on account of you not being so very good at sports.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry about your father.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll come around.
 <br>
 He always does.
 <br>
 My &#39;&#39;banky-boo&#39;&#39;! Hey, Forman.
 <br>
 So I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m gonna tell Kelso about me and Jackie.
 <br>
 Well, well.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad you finally decided to listen to your conscience.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not my conscience, man, &#39;cause I don&#39;t have a conscience.
 <br>
 You know that.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just &#39;cause, you know I figured me and Jackie might be together a little while, so- But, man, she&#39;s the devil.
 <br>
 What can I do? She&#39;s hot.
 <br>
 No, you only think she&#39;s hot because she&#39;s made of hellfire.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 What if you were stranded on a desert island with her? ( Sighs ) Murder-suicide.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 PictureJackie in a little bikini made out of coconuts.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s our signal fire? And don&#39;t give me any, &#39;&#39;Oh, boo-hoo, my hands are bleeding.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Suck it up.
 <br>
 Aw, damn, I got a splinter.
 <br>
 You couldn&#39;t grab the tweezers as the ship was going down? ( Scoffs ) Moron.
 <br>
 Well, that was unpleasant.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Try it again.
 <br>
 But this time do what I do.
 <br>
 ( No Audible Dialogue ) Good God, she is hot.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 What you talkin&#39; about? ( Hyde, Eric ) Indy 500.
 <br>
 - Nice.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Hey, can one of you guys give me a ride to the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 tomorrow? - I lost my license in California.
 <br>
 - Sure, Hyde&#39;ll take you.
 <br>
 - What? - Yeah.
 <br>
 It will give you two a chance to catch up.
 <br>
 He can tell you how he spent his summer break.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 - So what happened to your license, man? - Oh, a shark ate it.
 <br>
 Really? How? Fine.
 <br>
 I lost it.
 <br>
 You happy now! Oh, here you are.
 <br>
 How ya feeling? Better? I bet you&#39;re feeling better.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Is that liquor on your breath? What is the matter with you, Red? Well- You know- I mean- It&#39;s just- I&#39;m not sellin&#39; the Corvette! - What? - Kids are expensive.
 <br>
 That&#39;s gonna be the first thing to go.
 <br>
 I waited 25 years to have that car because we had kids.
 <br>
 And believe me, I love them.
 <br>
 But this is supposed to be our time.
 <br>
 Kitty, people our age don&#39;t have kids.
 <br>
 They have grandkids.
 <br>
 Well, we&#39;re having a kid, so deal with it.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m having a Corvette, so deal with that! Ooh, a staring contest.
 <br>
 I got winner.
 <br>
 Okay, Mr.
 <br>
 Red, it looks like it&#39;s just you and me.
 <br>
 Still the king.
 <br>
 And here I am ecstatic, and Red comes home babbling about his precious Corvette.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ll tell you something.
 <br>
 I may be the one who&#39;s pregnant, but I did not get that way by myself.
 <br>
 He&#39;s the one who wouldn&#39;t go to sleep.
 <br>
 You know, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, there are other ways of dealing with that.
 <br>
 I mean, have you tried telling him you just like him as a friend? You&#39;re carrying Red&#39;s baby.
 <br>
 He should be kissing your ass.
 <br>
 God! Why are men such jerks? Huh? Tell me.
 <br>
 Well, I just came in here for the ice cream so I&#39;m just gonna make mine to go.
 <br>
 Men plant their seed and think their work is done.
 <br>
 But women have a being growing inside of us the size of a wine jug.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got to come out somehow.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, oh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like that nature show, you know where the snake eats an antelope in one bite, and you&#39;re thinking, &#39;&#39;Impossible.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And then it-it-it unhinges its jaw, and in it goes.
 <br>
 Well, giving birth is just like that, only the other direction.
 <br>
 And I need your father there, holding my hand and telling me it&#39;s okay because I can&#39;t swallow an antelope alone.
 <br>
 No, you can&#39;t.
 <br>
 And no woman should have to.
 <br>
 That bastard.
 <br>
 ( Chattering ) Ah, we&#39;ve been here for, like, an hour.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve only moved, like, two feet.
 <br>
 You think the lines at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 are long? You should see the free clinic.
 <br>
 Now, there&#39;s a wait.
 <br>
 Man, you&#39;ve been to the free clinic? No.
 <br>
 Oh, but I did see your mom there.
 <br>
 Burn! ( Groans ) ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s gonna leave a mark.
 <br>
 Just like your mom did! Come on.
 <br>
 Move it! Damn! Gentlemen, I&#39;m sorry you had to see my dark side.
 <br>
 Please excuse me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna get to the bottom of this.
 <br>
 Ta-ta.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Look, man, I got to talk to you about some things that happened while you were gone this summer.
 <br>
 Hyde, if this is about free ice cream, naked volleyball or a dog wearing a hat and sunglasses, I&#39;d rather not even know.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s aboutJackie.
 <br>
 What aboutJackie? She was with someone, I knew it.
 <br>
 Damn it! Well, you know, you guys are broken up, so who cares, right? We&#39;re not- I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just- I mean, she was a big part of my life and I just hate the thought of her being off with some random guy.
 <br>
 Well, what if I told you it was with a friend? Would that make it better? No.
 <br>
 That would make it worse, stupid.
 <br>
 Aw, you&#39;re messing with me.
 <br>
 Okay, &#39;cause I- A friend would never do that.
 <br>
 Aw, man.
 <br>
 Hyde, you got me again.
 <br>
 Just like I got your mom! ( Laughing ) What is with the hitting? Guys? I love this place.
 <br>
 I want to work here.
 <br>
 You just said you hated it.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I went up to the counter, and the guy treated me like crap.
 <br>
 But he was treating everybody like crap- poor, rich, black, white.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all crap.
 <br>
 And look at him.
 <br>
 Think he was popular in high school? No way.
 <br>
 But now he&#39;s the belle of the ball.
 <br>
 Well, my friends, it&#39;s my turn to get a taste of those balls.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 I was just inside with Mom and she&#39;s really upset.
 <br>
 I just want to know- What&#39;s your problem? You made me bald.
 <br>
 - What? - Five generations- not one bald head in my family.
 <br>
 Then you came along, and- Well, look at it.
 <br>
 Children make me bald.
 <br>
 You know what? Wear a hat.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause Mom is really scared and she could really use a little damn support right now.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t usually tell you what to do &#39;cause you usually do the right thing, but this time you didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 You know how you&#39;re always telling me to be a man? Well, be a man! I made you bald? You made me skinny! Oh, hey.
 <br>
 How&#39;d it go at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 ? Did you tell Kelso? Nah, I blew it off.
 <br>
 What? Why? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just really hot in there.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause I think you chickened out.
 <br>
 No, I didn&#39;t chicken out, man.
 <br>
 I just didn&#39;t want to drop the news in front of all those people, you know? I mean, haven&#39;t I done enough to the guy? So you felt bad? Oh, my God, you felt bad! No, I don&#39;t feel bad.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t feel anything.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I think someone&#39;s been to Oz and gotten himself a heart.
 <br>
 - Shut up, Forman.
 <br>
 - Yeah, Eric.
 <br>
 Maybe we should lay off.
 <br>
 He&#39;s had a rough day.
 <br>
 - Aw.
 <br>
 - I really want to lay off but it&#39;s just so hot in here.
 <br>
 Get bent! - ( Door Closes ) - He felt bad.
 <br>
 - I think we really got through to him.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s not gonna tell Kelso.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re hiding out here.
 <br>
 Got a call for some man about a Corvette.
 <br>
 What, you gonna buy another one so you can ride &#39;em around like a couple of water skis? - I&#39;m selling the Corvette.
 <br>
 - What? Look, could we finish this later? I&#39;m kind of in the middle of something.
 <br>
 Is that Eric&#39;s old cradle? Yeah, well, uh, the paint was all chipped off and I kind of remember that, uh- that they liked sleepin&#39; in this thing when they weren&#39;t peein&#39; and poopin&#39; all over the place.
 <br>
 Oh, Red.
 <br>
 That is so sweet.
 <br>
 Yeah, well it might be fun.
 <br>
 Hell, this time we might even get an athlete.
 <br>
 Oh! - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 So did you tell Michael yet? Oh, yeah, well, I was gonna, but, um, you know the timing just didn&#39;t seem right.
 <br>
 Oh, I-I understand.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s kind of like- it&#39;s kind of like setting your hair.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t wait long enough, then it&#39;s totally flat and- ( Scoffs ) like Donna&#39;s.
 <br>
 But if you wait just the right amount of time, then it&#39;s perfect like mine.
 <br>
 Steven, are you even listening to me? God help me, I am.
 <br>
 Steven.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s what an adulteress is.
 <br>
 I always thought that it was a tiny adult.
 <br>
 Hey, uh- Hey, buddy, what do you say we take this party back to the living room, huh? Um, yeah, that&#39;s a good idea.
 <br>
 No, but I want a peanut butter and banana- ( Chuckling ) Why is Hyde kissin&#39;Jackie? What the hell? He&#39;s dead.
 <br>
 They have a lot of questions in the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>

 <br>
 application.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Sex&#39;&#39;? Please.
 <br>
 ( Giggles ) Lots.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Address&#39;&#39;? If I must, but I prefer pants.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;State&#39;&#39;? Nervous but excited.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Mother&#39;s maiden name&#39;&#39;? Streisand, but she won&#39;t acknowledge me.
