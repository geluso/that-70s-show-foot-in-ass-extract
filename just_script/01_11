<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 All right, this is basically all you need to know about Bohr&#39;s theory of atomic structure.
 <br>
 Cool, man.
 <br>
 Thanks, I appreciate it.
 <br>
 Listen, you don&#39;t mind me being your chemistry lab partner? No.
 <br>
 Why would I mind? Just &#39;cause I, you know, I tend to blow things up.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Buddy, what are you doing? - Unlocking my car.
 <br>
 - No way.
 <br>
 This is your car? - So, you&#39;re the guy I hate.
 <br>
 - Yeah, that would be me.
 <br>
 - Can I just - Yeah, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re my lab partner.
 <br>
 I could take you for a ride if you want.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go! Hey, don&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 Here you go, Red.
 <br>
 Your very first paycheck.
 <br>
 Thanks, Bob.
 <br>
 You know, I really appreciate the job.
 <br>
 Yeah, I just wish you had a commission check in there.
 <br>
 Well, I haven&#39;t sold a damn thing.
 <br>
 Yet.
 <br>
 But if I paid people for almost selling something you&#39;d be rich.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 But, hey, today is your day.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 May I help you? Yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like to buy a refrigerator.
 <br>
 What kind of refrigerator would you like? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 What kind of features are you looking for? I&#39;d like it to be cold.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 How many cubic feet of food does your family consume in a week? Gee, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - I do know I like Harvest Gold.
 <br>
 - See, now there&#39;s your first mistake.
 <br>
 Now, color is the last thing that you want to consider.
 <br>
 You see, I can&#39;t sell you something if you don&#39;t know what you really want.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 It was wrong of me to walk in here, ready to write a check.
 <br>
 But thanks.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Hey! Where the hell is Forman, man? This isn&#39;t like him.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really starting to get worried.
 <br>
 What if something happened to him? Nothing happened to him.
 <br>
 What if he&#39;s lost or hurt somewhere? Calm down, Lassie, I&#39;m sure Timmy&#39;s just fine.
 <br>
 Maybe we should check the school morgue.
 <br>
 Kelso, the school doesn&#39;t have a morgue.
 <br>
 Then what do we pay all those taxes for? You know what kills me? You do better in school than I do.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m worried, man.
 <br>
 - Okay, fine.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just be logical, right? Forman&#39;s not gonna just ditch us.
 <br>
 The Cruiser&#39;s battery is probably dead or something.
 <br>
 You know what? It&#39;s starting to get late.
 <br>
 Maybe we should just start walking? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not walking.
 <br>
 If God wanted us to walk, he wouldn&#39;t have given us Forman.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 That&#39;s Buddy Morgan.
 <br>
 Man, I had such a crush on him in seventh grade.
 <br>
 He is driving the fiery chariot of the sun god.
 <br>
 He&#39;s with Eric? This is a serious clique breach.
 <br>
 A serious clique breach? That&#39;s the worst kind.
 <br>
 You see, Buddy is in the rich kid clique.
 <br>
 They mingle with the jock clique.
 <br>
 Then you have your smokers and your heads.
 <br>
 Okay? Rich kids can be smokers, and jocks can be heads but jocks cannot be smokers, unless they&#39;re rich.
 <br>
 What about Larry Mosely? He&#39;s a rich, jock, smoker, head.
 <br>
 Okay, now you&#39;re just being difficult.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Buddy, you know everyone.
 <br>
 Right? Hi.
 <br>
 No, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually met.
 <br>
 No, I am Fez.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 My gosh, Buddy, with a car like that, you must be knee deep in whores.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s head back to my house.
 <br>
 Now, Red, you know working as a salesman is different from working at a plant.
 <br>
 You need time to adjust.
 <br>
 You need to use your people skills.
 <br>
 Kitty, I don&#39;t have any people skills.
 <br>
 Okay, come on, now.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Buck up.
 <br>
 You can do this.
 <br>
 All you have to do is smile.
 <br>
 That is the most important people skill of all.
 <br>
 So come on.
 <br>
 Let me see it.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Okay, you just keep on smiling.
 <br>
 They&#39;re finally getting off the island.
 <br>
 No, Fez, they&#39;re not getting off the island.
 <br>
 But they have a coconut radio.
 <br>
 What could go wrong? Oh, Jilligan.
 <br>
 There you guys are.
 <br>
 Where have you been? Where have we Where have you been? We&#39;ve been worried sick about you.
 <br>
 We had to walk all the way here, man.
 <br>
 My feet are killing me.
 <br>
 Are your fingers broken? You can&#39;t use a phone? Do you know it&#39;s freezing outside? And I&#39;m wearing my uncle&#39;s boots, so now I&#39;ve a blister.
 <br>
 Shaggy, Scooby, we&#39;ve got company.
 <br>
 Buddy Morgan.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know you.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess it&#39;s my fault.
 <br>
 I gave Eric a ride home.
 <br>
 - So - Get out of my chair! Okay.
 <br>
 I really have to be going anyway.
 <br>
 So your car is still at school? Yeah, you&#39;re damn right it is.
 <br>
 - I could drop you off if you want.
 <br>
 - Yeah, sure.
 <br>
 Guys, I&#39;m real sorry I forgot about you.
 <br>
 Did you want to drive? Hell, yeah! I call backseat.
 <br>
 Did you see that? He just ditched us again.
 <br>
 Do you even know how difficult it is to clique jump? Eric has achieved something very special, and you&#39;re both ruining it for him.
 <br>
 Who cares? I&#39;m tired and I never want to walk anywhere again.
 <br>
 Michael, walk me home.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, what&#39;s your problem with Buddy? I mean, he seems nice enough.
 <br>
 Screw him, man.
 <br>
 I mean, he&#39;s got the money, the car, the family.
 <br>
 The teachers like him, the counselors like him.
 <br>
 Everybody likes him.
 <br>
 I hate him.
 <br>
 Hyde, don&#39;t you think you&#39;re overreacting just a little bit? Donna, let me tell you something, okay? When high school&#39;s over, Buddy Morgan&#39;s going to a great college.
 <br>
 You know where I&#39;m gonna be? Sitting right here in my uncle&#39;s boots.
 <br>
 At least you&#39;ve got great friends.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll always be your friend.
 <br>
 Thanks, Donna.
 <br>
 That was sympathy, Hyde.
 <br>
 Not an opening for you to put your hand on my knee.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Move your hand.
 <br>
 Now, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m a friendly guy and I want to help you.
 <br>
 But if you don&#39;t know how many amps you need there&#39;s nothing I can do for you.
 <br>
 Think, lady.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Bob! Hi, there, I&#39;m Bargain Bob.
 <br>
 I see you&#39;re looking at blenders.
 <br>
 Now this one here, all wrong for you.
 <br>
 I&#39;d say it&#39;s between these two but this one, visualize yourself blending with this one.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Okay! Just take that over to our cashier and have a beautiful day.
 <br>
 - Number 10, your order is ready.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I&#39;ll be right there.
 <br>
 Number 10.
 <br>
 I have limited counter space.
 <br>
 Please remove your hot dog.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t see why you can&#39;t just serve us our food, Frank.
 <br>
 We are paying customers, you know.
 <br>
 I did not lose a leg in Vietnam, so that I could serve hot dogs to teenagers.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve both your legs, Frank.
 <br>
 Like I said, I did not lose a leg in Vietnam.
 <br>
 - Hey, guys.
 <br>
 - Hey, man, where&#39;s Forman? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not with me.
 <br>
 That damn Buddy again.
 <br>
 You know he only hangs out with Buddy &#39;cause he&#39;s got a Trans Am.
 <br>
 So, you guys only hang out with Eric &#39;cause of the Vista Cruiser and the basement.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve been friends with Forman since he was a kid, man.
 <br>
 - Way before he had any of that stuff.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Remember when he used to have that tree house and the go-kart? Hey, you.
 <br>
 Buy something or get out.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a big wedding coming in.
 <br>
 Frank, you don&#39;t have a big wedding coming in.
 <br>
 Did I say wedding? Because I meant to say, &#34;buy something or get out.
 <br>
 &#34; Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go some place else, then.
 <br>
 Come on, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not going anywhere.
 <br>
 I just bought a hot dog.
 <br>
 I&#39;m outta here.
 <br>
 Hello, welcome to the Hub.
 <br>
 May I help you? That was a great movie.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, who would have thought working at a car wash could be so much fun? - So what do you wanna do now? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Oh, God! What? Nothing.
 <br>
 I forgot to call Donna.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 - So she&#39;s like your girlfriend? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s okay to be confused, Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know, sometimes I feel like I don&#39;t know, like we&#39;re in a movie, right? And I&#39;m nervous around her and I feel like I&#39;m playing this part, right? But it&#39;s not me.
 <br>
 Whoa! What? You&#39;re gay! Me? No, I&#39;m not gay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not? But you just kissed me.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m gay.
 <br>
 Can you take me home now? And just because Johnny&#39;s a boy don&#39;t think that appearance and physique aren&#39;t important to him, too.
 <br>
 Johnny and Janey both need reassurance that they are accepted and respected for what they are.
 <br>
 - Look, I&#39;m not gay.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Are you sure? - Yes! - &#39;Cause I just thought that - Why would you think that? &#39;Cause we&#39;ve been spending so much time together.
 <br>
 Because we&#39;re friends.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been friends with Hyde for years, and I&#39;ve never put the moves on him.
 <br>
 Who could blame you? That guy&#39;s such a jerk.
 <br>
 Yeah, but that&#39;s not the reason.
 <br>
 It&#39;s because I&#39;m not gay.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m sorry for kissing you.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s Let&#39;s just forget about it.
 <br>
 - Do you wanna listen to the radio? - Look, I told you I wasn&#39;t gay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m dead weight.
 <br>
 I&#39;m quitting, Kitty.
 <br>
 Now, you can&#39;t quit.
 <br>
 Why not? Because if things keep going like this, Bob&#39;s going to fire you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a joke, Red.
 <br>
 I know! Let&#39;s do some role-playing.
 <br>
 What? Some role-playing.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be the interested customer and you be the helpful salesman.
 <br>
 Does this end up in the bedroom? We&#39;ll see.
 <br>
 Okay, here we go.
 <br>
 My, that&#39;s a lovely blender.
 <br>
 This is stupid.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got stainless steel rotor blades so it can crush ice which is why I keep it out here at the bar.
 <br>
 And it has the highest wattage that you can get without moving up to the industrial model which would cost you twice as much.
 <br>
 Now, see, we have had this blender all these years and I never knew that&#39;s why we bought it.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t know that? How could you not know that? Red, everybody doesn&#39;t research every product before they buy it.
 <br>
 Then they&#39;re dumbasses.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s why they need you to tell them what to buy.
 <br>
 I think you are just tailor-made for this job.
 <br>
 Heck, I go in to buy something, all I know is what color I want.
 <br>
 You&#39;re one of them.
 <br>
 I think you should be nice to me, Red.
 <br>
 Because I think I might be interested in purchasing a mattress.
 <br>
 Kitty, we don&#39;t even sell I miss Eric.
 <br>
 You still have me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not the same, Jackie.
 <br>
 I can talk to Eric about things that I can&#39;t talk about with you.
 <br>
 Okay, like what? For instance, the annoying things that you do.
 <br>
 Michael! See? I can&#39;t talk to you.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric, how&#39;s it So, what is everyone looking at? What are we looking at, man? We haven&#39;t seen you in days.
 <br>
 What, Hyde? You had to walk all the way home from school again? That&#39;s not the only reason we&#39;re upset with you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my only reason.
 <br>
 - I thought you had another reason.
 <br>
 - No, that&#39;s pretty much it.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Buddy? Buddy? Buddy got busy.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, I&#39;m sure he has a lot to do.
 <br>
 He is popular.
 <br>
 Yes, and so obviously gay.
 <br>
 Buddy is not gay! Please, Fez.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just stupid.
 <br>
 If Buddy was gay, he would have been all over me.
 <br>
 He would&#39;ve.
 <br>
 See you guys later.
 <br>
 So, Forman.
 <br>
 Now that the scary kids are gone is Buddy gay? - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really my place to - He&#39;s gay.
 <br>
 Okay, guys, hypothetical situation, crazy scenario wouldn&#39;t happen in like a million years.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just Let&#39;s say, okay.
 <br>
 That Buddy made a move on me.
 <br>
 Eric, he&#39;s not gonna make a move on you if he knows you&#39;re straight.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I mean, Forman is pretty irresistible.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll make a move on me again.
 <br>
 Again? Or for the first time.
 <br>
 You know I gotta go.
 <br>
 You know, Donna if Forman ever decides to dabble in the love that dare not speak its name I&#39;m here for you.
 <br>
 You got your variable speed here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s completely stainless steel throughout.
 <br>
 So you know it&#39;ll last forever.
 <br>
 Comes with everything you see.
 <br>
 And so, the only decision you&#39;d have to make is what color you want.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll take white.
 <br>
 - Can&#39;t go wrong there.
 <br>
 Thank you so much.
 <br>
 You know you&#39;re the most helpful salesman I&#39;ve ever had.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 You go ahead and look around.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll write this up.
 <br>
 I sold a Mix Master.
 <br>
 Jeez, Red, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 What did I tell you? Today is your day.
 <br>
 Hello, Kitty guess who sold a Mix Master? Hey, Buddy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna need those chemistry notes back.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Listen, man, if you don&#39;t want to be my lab partner anymore then I&#39;ll understand.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t mean it like that.
 <br>
 Look, we&#39;re still friends.
 <br>
 Really? Yeah.
 <br>
 Actually, Buddy I wanted to ask why me? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 You know it&#39;s probably the same reason that Donna likes you.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;re smart and sensitive and nice-looking.
 <br>
 Okay, first of all, I&#39;m not really that smart.
 <br>
 Those notes I gave you, copied.
 <br>
 Okay, and as for sensitive, sometimes I can just be downright mean.
 <br>
 You are so cute.
 <br>
 Well, that is I guess I am.
 <br>
 <br>
