<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey Fez.
 <br>
 Hey girl holding Fez&#39;s hand who I&#39;ve never seen before in my life - Everyone, meet Hilary, my girlfriend.
 <br>
 - Hi guys ! Is she really your girlfriend Fez ? Or did you just find her wandering from a scene of an accident and tell her she&#39;s your girlfriend ? No, this one&#39;s real.
 <br>
 See, no scratches.
 <br>
 Uhm, a little privacy please.
 <br>
 You want privacy ? You spy on me and Randy all the time.
 <br>
 Donna, I like to watch.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like being watched.
 <br>
 That is just creepy.
 <br>
 You know, creepy is when you open the closet door and throw a shoe at me and tell me to get out of the way so that you can get a better view of Donna.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking for Samantha.
 <br>
 - Who are you ? - I&#39;m her husband.
 <br>
 Sam ! - Larry ? - Samantha.
 <br>
 Uh, this guy just said he was your husband which is a little off-putting because I&#39;m your husband.
 <br>
 I can explain this.
 <br>
 You&#39;re both my husband.
 <br>
 Wow, Hyde, I bet when you married a stripper, this was not the kind of threesome you expected.
 <br>
 That 70&#39; Show - Saison 8 Ã©pisode 16 &#34;My Fairy King&#34; Traduction Par Mona Sax La Forman Team Bis* So when you and I got married, you were already married to another guy ? Sort of.
 <br>
 Sort of ? There&#39;s no sort of a marriage.
 <br>
 When you say I do, you mean I do wanna marry you, not I do already have another husband.
 <br>
 Hey, everybody, Hyde&#39;s part of a boy harem.
 <br>
 Look, Hyde.
 <br>
 Larry was a regular at the club and one day he asked me to marry him.
 <br>
 He said he&#39;d rent me an apartment and buy me a Camaro, what was I supposed to say ? How about: &#34;no you creepy-eighty-year old looser.
 <br>
 &#34; Hey, nobody talks to Larry Lenan like that.
 <br>
 - Shut up Larry ! - Sorry.
 <br>
 Then I met you and I fell in love.
 <br>
 I figured we&#39;d just leave town and I&#39;d never see him again.
 <br>
 Luckily for me, you kept using my credit card.
 <br>
 Which expires in a month.
 <br>
 I got you a new one in the car.
 <br>
 So If she was married to him, before she married you, then you guys aren&#39;t even legally married.
 <br>
 Which means this is freaking hilarious ! Red, I just heard some bad news.
 <br>
 I run over to tell you.
 <br>
 Bob, you live next door.
 <br>
 What are you panting ? I was going against the wind.
 <br>
 They are opening a Muffler Master right here in Point Place.
 <br>
 - What ? - Oh, jeez.
 <br>
 My shop barely survives as it is.
 <br>
 Muffler Master is not going to drive you out of town.
 <br>
 They&#39;re a big chain.
 <br>
 They&#39;re always throwing their weight around, crashing unmeaning and smaller than themselves.
 <br>
 They&#39;re like Bob at a cup scout pancakes breakfast.
 <br>
 Well, they are just a faceless corporation.
 <br>
 You have something they don&#39;t, a friendly smiling face behind the counter.
 <br>
 When did you hire a new guy ? This town needs to know that there is a friendly neighborhood muffler man that they can go to.
 <br>
 So you should have a sale.
 <br>
 No ! A sale-bretion ! I&#39;ll make muffins.
 <br>
 You can give one away with each muffler.
 <br>
 Just don&#39;t sell more than 12 mufflers because Jodie Alterman still has my other tin.
 <br>
 See you later alligator.
 <br>
 After a while you big baboon.
 <br>
 Unbelievable.
 <br>
 Fez has Hilary.
 <br>
 You have Randy.
 <br>
 Now Steven&#39;s wife has two husbands.
 <br>
 Why am I alone and all these stupid less attractive people are happy ? Ugly people need love too.
 <br>
 Just like bitches.
 <br>
 I need a boyfriend.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t want to end up with someone as stupid as Michael or someone who&#39;s wrong for me as Steven.
 <br>
 Ohhh, I know, I&#39;m gonna write up a list.
 <br>
 Write down everything I want in a man and then find a guy who matches up.
 <br>
 I did that once.
 <br>
 But with candy.
 <br>
 Okay, what do I want in a guy.
 <br>
 Olympic gold medallist.
 <br>
 Someone who doesn&#39;t talk to the hell.
 <br>
 Ooh, who doesn&#39;t look like Eric.
 <br>
 Jackie, if you&#39;re serious about that list, maybe you should pick qualities that are a little more realistic.
 <br>
 Oh you&#39;re right, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 No faties, no baldies.
 <br>
 What are you still doing here ? I thought you&#39;d be half way to Vegas by now with your husband.
 <br>
 You&#39;re my husband.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m the guy you married because you were bored.
 <br>
 Next time, try tennis, you lunatic.
 <br>
 Hey, that&#39;s our wife you&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 - Shut up Larry.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 Hyde, for what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t love Larry.
 <br>
 I love you.
 <br>
 Oh, great.
 <br>
 You love me more than you love your grand father.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ll have you know.
 <br>
 I won&#39;t be gone without a fight.
 <br>
 - Shut up Larry ! - Without a fight it is ! Red, I&#39;m sorry that business is so slow.
 <br>
 I blame myself, I used margarine instead of butter in the muffins.
 <br>
 I ruined us to save 8 cents.
 <br>
 - Red, I told you, you should listen to me.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not renting a promotional monkey ! No ! No, you should turn this place into an adult bookstore.
 <br>
 Those places are packed 24 hours a day.
 <br>
 Sometimes you can&#39;t even get to the good stuff.
 <br>
 Oh, oh, Red ! A customer.
 <br>
 Now you show him that you have the personal touch that Muffler Master doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 And if that&#39;s doesn&#39;t work, tell him you have a fake leg.
 <br>
 There&#39;s an elderly at the hospital who has a fake leg and he just gets whatever he wants.
 <br>
 - Can I help you ? - Yeah, I need a muffler.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m appreciate in the business.
 <br>
 I mean sure, Muffler Master can give you half off but, here at Forman and Son, you get personalized home town service with a smile.
 <br>
 Half off ? What am I doing here ? Hey ! What about my damn service with a smile ? I have a fake leg ! Ok, stop everything.
 <br>
 I finished my perfect man list.
 <br>
 And all the pieces of my life are falling into place.
 <br>
 Oh would you just shush and listen ? Okay, first he has to be a gentleman.
 <br>
 Just like my Fezie.
 <br>
 He&#39;s always opening doors for me.
 <br>
 That way I can walk behind her and the view is better.
 <br>
 - Ok, my ideal guy has a great sense of humor.
 <br>
 - Oh, that&#39;s like Fez too.
 <br>
 Just this morning he told me the funniest knock-knock joke.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll tell you but I don&#39;t want to disturb us with ten minutes of glorious laughter.
 <br>
 Okay and third he has to be interested in women shoes.
 <br>
 - Oh Fez that&#39;s like last night when you put on my heels.
 <br>
 - Anyway.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll let you guys hash this out on your own.
 <br>
 Baby some stories are just for us.
 <br>
 Jackie, have you realized who fits every single thing on your list ? Yeah ! Elton John ! And I think he&#39;s single because he&#39;s never seen out with a girl ! No, I&#39;m talking about Fez.
 <br>
 What ? Hey, you wrote the list.
 <br>
 And the lists don&#39;t lie.
 <br>
 And you ideal man is Fez.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 that is almost as ridiculous as you looking in the mirror and thinking this outfit works.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah ? At least I can see over the bathroom counter to look in the mirror.
 <br>
 Oh, hey ! You know what ? I found the perfect dress for you that will fit you.
 <br>
 Oh you gonna have to borrow it from the Statue of Liberty.
 <br>
 Ok, ok, truth, I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just stop and call it even.
 <br>
 Ok, fine.
 <br>
 You like Feeez, you like Feez ! Today was a total disaster.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t send one muffler and I drew a dozen customers into the hands of my competition.
 <br>
 If I were a younger more flexible man, I&#39;d shoot my foot up at my own ass.
 <br>
 You think you got problems.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got a husband-in-law.
 <br>
 Okay, this should cheer the two of you up.
 <br>
 My secret 7-layer casserole.
 <br>
 The secret is layer 3 and 6 are burbon.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t gon back on the job market, it&#39;s a young man&#39;s game ! Plus I hate everybody.
 <br>
 Well, maybe you should think about retiring.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always saying how you&#39;d love more time to drive around town and yell at men who wear sandals.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t afford to retire.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not waiting for those bastards to put me out of business.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to Muffler Master&#39;s offices and give them a piece of my mind.
 <br>
 What if they tell you to take a flying leap ? Well then I&#39;ll throw a garbage can through their window.
 <br>
 So, basically, Jackie&#39;s list says the perfect man for her is Fez but she&#39;s in massive denial.
 <br>
 Jackie, it&#39;s not healthy to be in denial.
 <br>
 Once my uncle came in terms with his crush on Burt Reynolds a whole new world opened up for him.
 <br>
 Well, just because Fez matches up a few things on my list doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s the perfect match for me.
 <br>
 We&#39;re complete opposites.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like I&#39;m Beauty and he&#39;s the Beast.
 <br>
 Uhm Jackie, at the end of the story, Beauty and the Beast get together.
 <br>
 Oh, would you shut up, you reader.
 <br>
 There are plenty other things on the list.
 <br>
 For instance: my perfect guy compliments me, buys me present and comes when I call.
 <br>
 And none of that describes Fez.
 <br>
 Did you call me ? - What ? No.
 <br>
 I - Wow, Jackie.
 <br>
 You look fantastic today.
 <br>
 Oh, which reminds me, I got you a present.
 <br>
 Enjoy it, bye guys ! Wooow, that was weird ! So you decided what you were gonna do about Sam ? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 I mean.
 <br>
 On one hand, she kept this massive secret from me and I won&#39;t be able to trust her again.
 <br>
 On the other hand, I&#39;m a just a small town burnout.
 <br>
 Who am I to judge ? Well, All I know is that she makes you happy.
 <br>
 And the only other time I&#39;d seen such a big smile on your face was when you got Fez and Kelso to smash their heads together when you threw a peanut on the floor.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a tough decision man, I&#39;ll let the ball decide.
 <br>
 If I make the shot, I stay with Sam.
 <br>
 If I miss, I say goodbye.
 <br>
 Oh, God&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Kitty, I just got back from the Muffler Master&#39;s offices in Kenosha.
 <br>
 Oh I hate Kenosha, they think they&#39;re so much better than us just because they got a town-pool.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, I told them, no matter how many Mom and Pap&#39;s stores they put out of business, they&#39;d better not even think opening a store near mine or they&#39;ll get a fight from me like they&#39;ve never seen.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s my man.
 <br>
 What did they say ? - They&#39;re putting a store across the street.
 <br>
 Oh Red, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t be.
 <br>
 I scared the heck out of them.
 <br>
 They even offered to give a little money for my shop.
 <br>
 Well I hope you told them to get lost.
 <br>
 Of course I did.
 <br>
 Then they offered me more money.
 <br>
 And you told them to stuff it.
 <br>
 - Damn right.
 <br>
 Then they offered me a lot of money.
 <br>
 - Go to hell Muffler Master ! Actually, I accepted it.
 <br>
 Thank You Muffler Master ! Oh, oh I can&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Me neither.
 <br>
 But you know I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said about retiring.
 <br>
 And I think with this cheque, we can just about do it.
 <br>
 If it&#39;s okay with you.
 <br>
 Oh Red.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to ask my permission for anything.
 <br>
 You have fought in two wars, you have worked you whole life, you deserve to cash in.
 <br>
 Well, I couldn&#39;t have done it without my best gal ! Well speaking of things you can&#39;t do without your best gal uhm how would like to go celebrate.
 <br>
 I was thinking the same thing ! Oh you meant.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 well sure, we can get a steak later ! It doesn&#39;t bother you that Muffler Master is going to turn your shop into a parking lot ? As long as that cheque clears, I don&#39;t care if they turn it into a communist recreation center.
 <br>
 Anyway, what happened between you and Sam ? Oh well we finally got some time alone, we talked, I told her it would be a mistake if we stayed together.
 <br>
 She agreed and we hugged.
 <br>
 And she jumped back on the main stage and finished up her act.
 <br>
 Well, you two kids lasted longer than I expected.
 <br>
 I thought she was going to knock you out, steal your wallet on the first night.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 I thought you&#39;d be half way to Vegas by now.
 <br>
 Hyde, I&#39;m really sorry that things didn&#39;t work out.
 <br>
 Yeah, me too.
 <br>
 But I&#39;d like to think that if our paths ever cross again, I&#39;ll be able to give you 20 dollars and you&#39;ll be able to dance for me, that wouldn&#39;t be akward.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like that.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 See ya.
 <br>
 You&#39;re alright ? Yeah.
 <br>
 Let me tell you something son.
 <br>
 I dodged a lot of bullets in Korea.
 <br>
 But not one as crazy and blind as the one you just side-stepped.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird, man.
 <br>
 I never imagined myself divorced from a Vegas stripper with a second husband at this age.
 <br>
 I never imagined myself retired at this age.
 <br>
 But all I know is, when life finally gives you a break from the crap storm, the best thing that you can do is to crack open a beer with a friend.
 <br>
 To retirement.
 <br>
 To divorce.
 <br>
 You know, Red, time is going to be great.
 <br>
 Sleeping in every day, watching TV, doing nothing.
 <br>
 I&#39;d be happy to show you how to do.
 <br>
 BEAUTY ! Beast ! I like your haircut.
 <br>
 Oh thank you for noticing.
 <br>
 Yeah, I had them taken off a little extra off the wrists.
 <br>
 So what brings you up to the Forest of No Return ? See I wrote up this list over who my perfect match should be, and everyone thinks it&#39;s you.
 <br>
 I mean, isn&#39;t that crazy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a beast ! That&#39;s true, I&#39;m disgusting.
 <br>
 Yeah ! Oh you you, actually have a little piece of elf right here.
 <br>
 Did I get it ? No, no, here, here come here.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;ll see you later Beast.
 <br>
 Beast ! You&#39;re totally hot.
 <br>
 Holy crap ! I&#39;m going to save a fortune on razors ! Well, you&#39;re not a beast at all.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a handsome prince.
 <br>
 The list was right.
 <br>
 You are the one for me.
 <br>
 Then come and get the royal treatment baby.
 <br>
 Jackie ! Are you okay ? You were moaning in your sleep and while I found it enjoyable, I thought I should wake you up.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m fine, no I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just that.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - Fez ! Get back in here you beast.
 <br>
 Alright I&#39;m coming my beauty.
 <br>
 Grrrrrr.
 <br>
 - Hi honey, how was your day ? - Oh, great, great.
 <br>
 I scared an entire village and then I tore down all the trees in the forest.
 <br>
 What&#39;s for diner ? I made you a special dish.
 <br>
 Macaroni and children ? Italian ! My favorite ! I do smell good ! Hey, save me a piece of me !
 <br>
