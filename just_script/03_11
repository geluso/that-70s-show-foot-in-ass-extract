<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Donna, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re my study partner.
 <br>
 Because you make learning fun.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, no more study breaks.
 <br>
 We have to get this report done.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Okay.
 <br>
 - [Clears Throat] - A report on the current state of U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 -Soviet relations.
 <br>
 Okay, we need a title.
 <br>
 How &#39;bout &#34;Current State of U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 -Soviet Relations&#34;? Damn, you&#39;re smart.
 <br>
 U.
 <br>
 S.
 <br>
 -Soviet Relations.
 <br>
 [Sighs] You know, Donna, I lost my underwear.
 <br>
 But whatever.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Seriously, we need to get some work done.
 <br>
 Donna, I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Right now, with a push of a button the two superpowers could condemn us to painful, fiery deaths.
 <br>
 Fiery deaths.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Seriously, we gotta do this thing.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Eric, no more study breaks.
 <br>
 Uh, right.
 <br>
 From now on, all business.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] The arms race began with the massive buildup of bombers by the Soviet Union.
 <br>
 Actually, the United States started the arms buildup.
 <br>
 No, they didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 What about the bomber gap? Bomber gap? [Chuckling] What? That&#39;s so cute.
 <br>
 Bombers by the United States.
 <br>
 What are you doing? Study break? Get bent.
 <br>
 Ow.
 <br>
 ! Oh, there&#39;s my underwear.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! - Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong? - Eric, you can&#39;t just ignore my ideas.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Donna.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll get the same &#34;A&#34; I get.
 <br>
 Relax, baby.
 <br>
 Eric, I can&#39;t relax &#39;cause you&#39;re wrong, and I&#39;m right.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I think we need to clear our heads with a nice study break.
 <br>
 Eric, knock it off.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not in the mood for a stupid study break.
 <br>
 What? Why? Because I disagree with you? - It has nothing to do with that.
 <br>
 - Really, Donna? Because up until now, we were going at it like rabbits who had just gotten out of prison.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 So what are you saying? You&#39;re gonna hold out on me until I agree with you? Because that&#39;s not gonna work, Donna.
 <br>
 First of all, I&#39;m not holding out on you.
 <br>
 And second of all, if I did, it would so work.
 <br>
 Okay, well, you know what? I think that is what you&#39;re doing.
 <br>
 So try this dress on for size! I&#39;m cutting you off! Yeah! - Is that supposed to be a threat? - Supposed to be.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 If you wanna do this, we&#39;ll do this.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re gonna cave, and I&#39;m gonna laugh.
 <br>
 Yeah! I just saw a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 ! Oh, my God! What an unbelievable coincidence.
 <br>
 I was just telling Fez about how dumb you are! Okay.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m out in the field, right? And there it was.
 <br>
 It was in the air, and it had lights, and it was, like- [Whirring Noise] [Whirring Noise Continues] That&#39;s a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 , all right.
 <br>
 Hang on, Fez.
 <br>
 Kelso.
 <br>
 Remember that time you thought you saw the Abominable Snowman? Yeah.
 <br>
 - Do you remember what it turned out to be? - Just a regular snowman.
 <br>
 Guys, come on.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go out to the field.
 <br>
 It could come back.
 <br>
 You think I got nothing better to do than stand in a field freezing my &#39;nads off? Hey, who wants to help me connect the dots? Sorry, &#39;nads.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 [Motor Roaring] What is all that noise? Oh, Bob&#39;s cutting down a tree in his front yard.
 <br>
 By himself? Doesn&#39;t he know that&#39;s incredibly dangerous? Yeah, but you know what they say about Bob- &#34;He&#39;s stupid.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, Red.
 <br>
 Is that any way to talk about a friend? A stupid friend.
 <br>
 - [Creaking] - [Bob] Timber.
 <br>
 ! Oh, no.
 <br>
 ! Oh, damn it! Did Bob kill me? Oh, but he just feels super bad about it.
 <br>
 Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 So, where is everyone? Boy, you can hardly tell where your head was crushed.
 <br>
 Where are all my friends? You don&#39;t really have any friends, Red.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s-it&#39;s an unfortunate side effect of telling everybody to-to stick it up their butts.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Gee, I guess you&#39;re right, Kitty.
 <br>
 Maybe I should have been nicer.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, well.
 <br>
 Hindsight&#39;s twenty-twenty.
 <br>
 You just lie back and enjoy your coffin.
 <br>
 Ooh, satin.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Red! Red! Oh, I&#39;m so sorry! It was an accident.
 <br>
 Bob I never thought I&#39;d say this but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re my friend.
 <br>
 Red, I never thought I&#39;d say this but you smell nice.
 <br>
 - [Donna] Jackie, that&#39;s really annoying.
 <br>
 - [Eric] Knock it off, Hyde! Donna, is there something you need to talk about? Oh, crap.
 <br>
 Do you need to talk about something? [Donna, Eric] Can you keep a secret? - [Jackie] Not really.
 <br>
 - [Hyde] Yeah.
 <br>
 Unless I can burn you with it later.
 <br>
 I&#39;m holding out on Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;m holding out on Donna.
 <br>
 Donna, that&#39;s great! Forman, that&#39;s hysterical.
 <br>
 [Jackie, Hyde] So, how long has it been? [Donna, Eric] Three of the longest days of my life.
 <br>
 [Donna, Eric] Maybe I should just cave.
 <br>
 [Jackie, Hyde] No! If you cave, she owns you.
 <br>
 When he caves, you own him.
 <br>
 Yeah, but there&#39;s no way she wants it as bad as I do.
 <br>
 Can you blame her? I think I want it more than Eric.
 <br>
 Eww.
 <br>
 Why? Forman, sex is how women control men.
 <br>
 Donna, sex is how we control men.
 <br>
 If they ever find out we want it too we&#39;ll never get jewelry again.
 <br>
 Secretly, I believe they like it as much as we do.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 You and your crazy conspiracies.
 <br>
 Hyde, what are you doing? This means something.
 <br>
 This is important.
 <br>
 Well, this is a close encounter of the potato kind.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going, guys? Good to see you all.
 <br>
 Kitty, I&#39;ve been thinking.
 <br>
 It might be fun to have our friends over for a party.
 <br>
 Oh, whoo-hoo! Party at Red&#39;s! Are you feeling okay, Red? Oh, honey, honey, don&#39;t touch him.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Well, I just- I have never heard you use the words &#34;fun,&#34; &#34;friends&#34; and &#34;party&#34; all in the same sentence.
 <br>
 I have, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 For instance, &#34;Eric, I had fun ruining the party for you and your friends.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah, that was fun.
 <br>
 Well, I think a party is a great idea, Red.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Then it&#39;s settled.
 <br>
 How you doin&#39; there, Sabu? He smells nice.
 <br>
 [Knocking] - Hello, Donna.
 <br>
 - Hello, Eric.
 <br>
 I have come to work on our report.
 <br>
 - Excellent.
 <br>
 May I take your coat for you? - Of course.
 <br>
 [Thinking] Holy crap! She is so sexy.
 <br>
 Be strong.
 <br>
 Fight back.
 <br>
 Use the look.
 <br>
 [Thinking] Oh, no.
 <br>
 Not the look.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so-Wait.
 <br>
 I find this hot? What is wrong with me? Come on, Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Counterattack.
 <br>
 - [Clattering] - Oops.
 <br>
 [Thinking] Look away! Oh, I can&#39;t look away.
 <br>
 Must touch.
 <br>
 No! Be strong.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Well, Donna, if you would refer to page 83- [Blows] [Thinking] Oh, the ear! Damn him! Wait.
 <br>
 Must win this for womankind.
 <br>
 Must crush Eric.
 <br>
 Red alert.
 <br>
 She is touching your thigh! Oh, no.
 <br>
 Plan backfiring.
 <br>
 Thigh is so warm, inviting.
 <br>
 Bony, but nice.
 <br>
 Donna, your mother&#39;s on the Phone.
 <br>
 Oh, thank God! - Eric, everything all right? - Fine.
 <br>
 Shut the door, please.
 <br>
 [Humming Theme From Close Encounters Of The Third Kind] [All Humming Theme] Hey, dudes.
 <br>
 Leo, what are you doing here, man? Wow.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a really good question, man.
 <br>
 - Leo? - I&#39;m working on it, man.
 <br>
 - Chocodile? - What&#39;s that? It&#39;s a Twinkie wrapped in chocolate, man.
 <br>
 No, in the sky! Those lights.
 <br>
 I think that&#39;s a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a plane.
 <br>
 They&#39;re all just planes.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, we&#39;ll see about that.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] Now I&#39;ve got photographic evidence.
 <br>
 Of what? That planes can fly? I saw a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Once, man.
 <br>
 It was awesome.
 <br>
 It just hung in the air.
 <br>
 Then it sent me a message in big, bright yellow letters.
 <br>
 It told me I was gonna have a good year.
 <br>
 Did this, by any chance, happen at a football game? Yeah, man.
 <br>
 And the weird thing was, I was the only one freaking out about it.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 Good year? Ah, it was a terrible year, man.
 <br>
 Stupid aliens.
 <br>
 Hey, Red! I was just telling Tony here how I almost killed you with a tree.
 <br>
 - Ooh.
 <br>
 - Ooh-hoo-hoo.
 <br>
 - Close call like that can really make you think, huh? - You bet.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s like I was upset that you hadn&#39;t returned my hedge clippers.
 <br>
 Oh, shoot.
 <br>
 I think I gave those to my brother-in-law.
 <br>
 You did, did you? Oh, well, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like you stole them or anything.
 <br>
 You just took &#39;em and never returned &#39;em which is different somehow.
 <br>
 [Forced Chuckling] Ha! [Chuckling] It&#39;s- Mom, can I ask you a question? In your relationship with Dad, have you ever let an argument cross into other parts of your relationship? What do you mean? You know, I mean, do you ever not have sex with Dad? Sure! I&#39;m not having sex with him right now.
 <br>
 No, Mom, I mean, like, in an argument, to get your way.
 <br>
 You can do that? Yeah.
 <br>
 I just wonder if it&#39;s wrong.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;re saying by my not having sex with your father I can get him to paint the bathroom? Yeah.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t you think it hurts the relationship? Blah, blah, blah! I&#39;m getting my bathroom painted! And two of them to turn the ladder.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] [Forced Laughing] Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, those Polish people- they sure don&#39;t know much about lightbulbs.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 Two of them turn the ladder.
 <br>
 So Sammy Davis Jr.
 <br>
 , the pope and this Polish guy are on a plane, see? There&#39;s only the one parachute.
 <br>
 Hey, Red, seeing as how you&#39;re dead and all, can I have those shoes? Get away from him! Red, honey, your funeral&#39;s a big hit.
 <br>
 You are corpse of the year.
 <br>
 Just put the lid on, Kitty.
 <br>
 I need some freakin&#39; quiet.
 <br>
 - Are you having fun? - No.
 <br>
 Turns out I was mistaken.
 <br>
 Life is too short to spend it with people who annoy you.
 <br>
 L- I just wanna spend it with people I really, really love.
 <br>
 Like you and, uh- Well, mostly just you.
 <br>
 - [Tapping Glass] - Everybody.
 <br>
 Thanks for being here.
 <br>
 And I just wanna say when my time comes, I wanna be buried facedown so that anyone who doesn&#39;t like me can kiss my ass.
 <br>
 [Nervous Laughing] Hey, Kelso, man.
 <br>
 I brought you your film.
 <br>
 U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Pictures came out okay.
 <br>
 Aha! Proof.
 <br>
 But these naked ones of you are far more interesting, man.
 <br>
 What? Those were on that roll? You know, I don&#39;t see a U.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 O but I can definitely see Uranus.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a planet, but it&#39;s also your butt.
 <br>
 You guys are so immature.
 <br>
 - Kelso, why are you squirting water out of your mouth? - I was a fountain! I totally got it, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s art.
 <br>
 Man.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys wanna see the other set he brought? Ohh! Donna, we&#39;ve gotta get this thing done.
 <br>
 This report is due in six hours.
 <br>
 Yeah, Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been thinking about it.
 <br>
 This whole Cold War standoff? It&#39;s ridiculous.
 <br>
 Neither side is getting what it wants.
 <br>
 So, what you&#39;re saying is by hurting each other, they&#39;re actually hurting themselves.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It must be incredibly frustrating for both sides.
 <br>
 Both of them are just building up and building up.
 <br>
 The urge to launch a first strike must be overwhelming and painful.
 <br>
 You know, Donna, in a lot of ways, what we&#39;re going through here is just like the Cuban missile crisis except in our case, it&#39;s a missile crisis.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s time for détente.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 What about our disagreement? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 You win, okay? - [Chuckling] - What? It&#39;s just- I can&#39;t believe you caved.
 <br>
 Wait until I tell Hyde.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No! Where are you going? Suddenly I&#39;m- I&#39;m not in the mood.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lying! Donna, we&#39;re past the point of no return here.
 <br>
 Eric, girls don&#39;t have a point of no return.
 <br>
 So see you tomorrow.
 <br>
 - Donna? - Yes, Eric? - I cave.
 <br>
 - Oh, thank God, &#39;cause I was just bluffing.
 <br>
 [Both Chuckling]
