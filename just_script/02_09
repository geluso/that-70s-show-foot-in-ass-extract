 There they are! And theyre not even uggos! Oh theyre hot! The blond is blondand hot! Yes, and since I set us up on this date, shes mine, right? Well I can see why youd think that, but actually, since I came along to help you out, American custom dictates that I get the blond.
 <br>
 Once again, the local custom bones the foreign guy.
 <br>

 Dont you like thinking about me? No ofcourse I do, the thing is, how can I say this without hurting your feelings Oh okay, I dont want you stupid things in my cool van! OH! NO! I didnt say you were stupid, just everything you like! Congratulations Eric, you got suspended.
 <br>
 Are you getting dumber? Gee I dont think so.
 <br>
 Look dad, I dont smoke.

 Being grounded makes it so much naughtier!
