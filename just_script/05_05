<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 You know, Eric, I&#39;m really happy with our relationship right now.
 <br>
 Yeah, me too.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like we&#39;re way past the &#39;&#39;broken up and miserable&#39;&#39; stage and we&#39;re back in the &#39;&#39;having sex again&#39;&#39; stage, so- Yeah.
 <br>
 Thumbs up from this end too.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;ve been through a lot and even though some of it wasn&#39;t exactly fun- I mean, it was worth it, because now we know that we can handle anything.
 <br>
 And we don&#39;t freak out about the little stuff.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Like that time we got in that big fight because I ran over your cat.
 <br>
 - That wasn&#39;t little stuff.
 <br>
 I really loved that cat.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 No, I know.
 <br>
 I- I mean, uh, the cat was little.
 <br>
 Anyway, when you came to California, I knew you were the one.
 <br>
 So I got you a gift to symbolize how far we&#39;ve come.
 <br>
 Is it, like, one of those gifts that women get for men but they actually wear themselves? Here.
 <br>
 - ( Exhales ) - It&#39;s a ring.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m a man.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a man-ring.
 <br>
 A man-ring.
 <br>
 Yea! ( Mouths Word ) ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) Morning.
 <br>
 What the hell&#39;s that thing on your finger? This is my new man-ring.
 <br>
 Donna got it for me, so I&#39;ll feel right at home when the gypsies come to town.
 <br>
 Well, take it off.
 <br>
 You look like some kind of fruity magician.
 <br>
 Well, I think it&#39;s sweet.
 <br>
 I can enjoy these things now because I am not gonna let menopause get me down.
 <br>
 Mm-mmm.
 <br>
 No depression, night sweats, or sudden mood swings for me.
 <br>
 Well, I guess that&#39;s starting today, huh? &#39;Cause last night, you hit the trifecta there.
 <br>
 Well, I just refuse to be sad about the fact that I&#39;m never gonna have another baby.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t need another baby.
 <br>
 I got a lot to look forward to.
 <br>
 Like picking out my casket.
 <br>
 - Oh, Kitty.
 <br>
 - I- - It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - ( Sobbing ) You&#39;ve still got Eric.
 <br>
 He&#39;s sort of a baby.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll make him cry if you want.
 <br>
 - Man, that is one big-ass ring! - ( Stereo:Rock ) Hey, maybe people&#39;ll think you won the Super Bowl.
 <br>
 Nah.
 <br>
 Nobody&#39;d believe that.
 <br>
 But he could be the sick little kid the whole team rallies around.
 <br>
 Well, guys.
 <br>
 Wish me luck.
 <br>
 Today I have a job interview at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Good luck, man.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric.
 <br>
 What a glorious man-ring.
 <br>
 See, I told you to accessorize and you finally listened, huh? - Man, you like it? - Yeah.
 <br>
 What&#39;s not to like? It&#39;s hypnotic.
 <br>
 It looks like he has superpowers.
 <br>
 Man, I&#39;d like to see the lame-o superhero that had to wear that ring.
 <br>
 Okay, super pals I need a danger alert status report.
 <br>
 My sensors indicate peace and quiet throughout the universe.
 <br>
 I think the oceans are secure, but I cannot check for another 45 minutes.
 <br>
 Because I just ate.
 <br>
 ( Spaceship Door Beeps ) - Hi, guys.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve been brainwashed and forced to wear this hideously ugly ring! Actually, it&#39;s a gift.
 <br>
 From me.
 <br>
 Form of- the worst gift ever.
 <br>
 Shape of- uh, hope you kept the receipt.
 <br>
 - ( Beeping ) - Oh, no! Alien zombies are attacking the Earth.
 <br>
 - Let&#39;s swing into action, gang.
 <br>
 - Hang on a second! We&#39;re still on this ring.
 <br>
 Are you sure it&#39;s not an evil alien artifact? I got it at the mall.
 <br>
 Greetings, super dumb-asses.
 <br>
 Oh, no! It&#39;s Dr.
 <br>
 Bald.
 <br>
 Any minute now, my army of alien zombies will be inva- Good Lord! That is an ugly ring! Hey, alien zombies, get a load of that ring! ( All Laughing ) - All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 This thing&#39;s comin&#39; off.
 <br>
 - Oh, whoa! Be careful, man.
 <br>
 You drop something that big and heavy, it&#39;ll throw off the Earth&#39;s rotation.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll all go crashing into the sun.
 <br>
 Way to use science in a burn.
 <br>
 - ( Stereo:Rock ) - Donna, guess who hates the ring you got him? Eric hates the ring? - He told me he loved it.
 <br>
 - Well.
 <br>
 See Eric told Steven that the ring was so ugly that the Elephant Man wears it to distract people from his face.
 <br>
 That ring is beautiful.
 <br>
 You know, what&#39;s ugly is his bony little finger.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 You know what? If he can&#39;t appreciate it let&#39;s just take it back and buy me somethin&#39; pretty.
 <br>
 According to your application, your last job was as Dancer Number Three in the school production of My Fair Lady.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 It was magical.
 <br>
 ( Quoting Lyric ) Uh-huh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m afraid your theater experience doesn&#39;t really apply to working here at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 But, Nina, what is the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 really, if not one big stage? The D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 is the Department of Motor Vehicles.
 <br>
 It is not a stage.
 <br>
 Ah, but in a way, they&#39;re very similar.
 <br>
 - No, they&#39;re not.
 <br>
 - Oh, but really, they are.
 <br>
 - No, they&#39;re not.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - They are.
 <br>
 - No, they&#39;re not! I&#39;m just gonna put down no prior experience.
 <br>
 Fair enough.
 <br>
 Ah, but you haven&#39;t asked me about my special skills yet.
 <br>
 Well, I really don&#39;t see how a fondness for pie is relevant.
 <br>
 But, Nina, what is the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 really, if not one big pie shop? ( Clicking ) ( Clicking ) Great.
 <br>
 Clicker&#39;s on the fritz.
 <br>
 All I want to do is see the end of Guiding Light, and it won&#39;t click.
 <br>
 - ( Clicking ) - Click, damn it! Click! Kitty? I think your lady problem is acting up again.
 <br>
 It jus- It just won&#39;t click, that&#39;s all.
 <br>
 It&#39;s supposed to click, Red.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a clicker.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what it does.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get you to bed.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys? Uh, very important.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s coming over, and I lost the ring she gave me.
 <br>
 - I thought I had it in the basement.
 <br>
 - Eric, please! Your mother is having a breakdown.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 The only thing having a breakdown around here is the clicker! Why won&#39;t it click, Red? Nothing loves me! Okay, Eric.
 <br>
 Jackie just told me that Hyde told her that you hate the ring.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 I happen to think it&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 Besides, that is what a man-ring looks like.
 <br>
 Well, you know, Donna, maybe I&#39;m just not a man-ring kind of guy.
 <br>
 I mean, I like man-pants and man-shirts.
 <br>
 Eric, you could&#39;ve just told me you didn&#39;t like it when I gave it to you.
 <br>
 You know what? Just- Just give it back.
 <br>
 I absolutely will just as soon as I find it.
 <br>
 What? How could you lose it? I told you it was a symbol of our loving freakin&#39; relationship! And my losing it is a symbol of how much I love and respect you? I need cold compresses and a Bloody Mary.
 <br>
 Quick! Your mother is talking about adopting a communist orphan.
 <br>
 Now move.
 <br>
 I need help, damn it! ( Stereo: Rock ) I don&#39;t understand.
 <br>
 How could I lose a 25-pound ring? I once lost a six-foot-long rubber chili dog.
 <br>
 And I still haven&#39;t found it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just gone! You know what, Hyde? This whole thing&#39;s your fault.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the one who told Jackie I didn&#39;t like the ring.
 <br>
 Hyde stabbed you in the back? No.
 <br>
 He wouldn&#39;t do anything like that.
 <br>
 Like he didn&#39;t stealJackie from me.
 <br>
 Oh, wait a minute! Look, man.
 <br>
 I told her not to tell.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And I told you not to tell.
 <br>
 You and Jackie are gossiping now? You know, the more you two go out, the more like each other you get.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Who knows what you and your little girlfriend are gonna be like in a couple months.
 <br>
 - ( Whistle Blows ) - ( Together) Two, four, six, eight.
 <br>
 Who do we appreciate? Go team! - Whoo! - Whoo-hoo! Number one! Yeah! Jackie? I heard the best piece of gossip.
 <br>
 Eric Forman doesn&#39;t have any school spirit.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) I&#39;m tellin&#39; everyone! - Too late.
 <br>
 I already did.
 <br>
 - ( Squeals ) First of all, Jackie is not my girlfriend.
 <br>
 And second of all, I&#39;m not the only one who spills stuff around here.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso.
 <br>
 Hyde watches Little House on the Prairie.
 <br>
 Little House on the Prairie? It reminds me of a simpler time.
 <br>
 How could Eric lose that ring? And more importantly, how could he think it was ugly? It&#39;s got real nugget-gold plating and the abalone is inlaid.
 <br>
 If you were my girlfriend, I would be proud to wear that ring.
 <br>
 Heck, I&#39;d wear it if you just wanted to fool around a little.
 <br>
 Get my drift, Big &#39;&#39;D&#39;&#39;? ( Clicks Tongue, Groans ) All I know is, you guys better watch what you say around here.
 <br>
 Some people can&#39;t be trusted because they have a great, big mouth!Jackie! How could you say that? My mouth is in perfect proportion to the rest of my face.
 <br>
 Plenty of classy men wear rings.
 <br>
 Wayne Newton.
 <br>
 The pope.
 <br>
 My Uncle Carmine from Hoboken.
 <br>
 You lose his ring, you wake up in a Dumpster.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s just a warning! Now I think that&#39;s all the questions I have about your application.
 <br>
 Okay, but one thing my application doesn&#39;t say is how much I would apply myself to the job here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to ask you to stop making puns now.
 <br>
 I really don&#39;t think this is going to work out, so- ( Gasps ) Wow! That is a gorgeous man-ring.
 <br>
 You know, wearing a ring this big shows a lot of confidence.
 <br>
 Well, I do feel like a king when I wear it.
 <br>
 And, you know, what is the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 really, if not one big kingdom? You know what? You&#39;re stubborn, under qualified and you barely speak English.
 <br>
 Welcome to the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 You&#39;re mad at me for telling Donna a secret? Steven, I tell secrets.
 <br>
 It&#39;s who I am.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m sayin&#39; is, if you&#39;re gonna be my girlfriend you can&#39;t go runnin&#39; around, shootin&#39; off your big, fat, cheerleader mouth.
 <br>
 You just called me your girlfriend.
 <br>
 No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Yes, you did.
 <br>
 - No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Yes, you did.
 <br>
 - No, I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yes, you did, and shut up.
 <br>
 You&#39;re ruining it! Okay, now listen to me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll keep my mouth shut, if you admit that I&#39;m your girlfriend.
 <br>
 No, the price is too high.
 <br>
 Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m telling everybody everything anyways.
 <br>
 Starting with the fact that you called me your girlfriend.
 <br>
 You&#39;re blackmailing me? You&#39;re coming along nicely.
 <br>
 Good news.
 <br>
 I got the job.
 <br>
 What the hell is that on your finger? Oh, it&#39;s chocolate and coconut.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you took my ring.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I took it.
 <br>
 I took it, and I&#39;m proud.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t deserve something this beautiful.
 <br>
 You have a girlfriend.
 <br>
 You have a ring.
 <br>
 I have nothing! Well, you-you have a job.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Good for me.
 <br>
 You guys, look at this thing.
 <br>
 God, what was Donna thinking? Forman, you gotta expect this.
 <br>
 I mean, look at her dad.
 <br>
 The apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the Bob.
 <br>
 Now, this ring&#39;s a wolf attackin&#39; a zebra.
 <br>
 This one&#39;s a zebra attackin&#39; a wolf.
 <br>
 And in this one, they&#39;re finally friends.
 <br>
 Hey, there.
 <br>
 Hi, there.
 <br>
 Ho, there.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not goin&#39; to the game with you in that jacket, Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not goin&#39; to the game, Bob.
 <br>
 My God, she never had a chance.
 <br>
 Hyde, my girlfriend has bad taste.
 <br>
 Well, she is dating you.
 <br>
 Ah, a good burn, Fez.
 <br>
 And that ring is only the beginning, man.
 <br>
 I can see it now.
 <br>
 Eric, you look so foxy.
 <br>
 Hey, there.
 <br>
 Hi, there.
 <br>
 Ho, there.
 <br>
 Ta-da! Look what I found.
 <br>
 And I didn&#39;t even lose it.
 <br>
 Fez took it.
 <br>
 So, basically, you got mad at me for being a victim of robbery.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Apologetic look accepted.
 <br>
 Eric, I got mad at you for not being honest, and that hasn&#39;t changed.
 <br>
 Really? Huh, I thought it might&#39;ve.
 <br>
 I gave you the ring as a symbol of how far we&#39;ve come in our relationship.
 <br>
 And if you can&#39;t be honest, then you shouldn&#39;t be wearing that ring at all.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You want me to be honest? Okay.
 <br>
 I kind of think that you have bad taste.
 <br>
 What? I do not! Okay.
 <br>
 Well, then, tell me what you think of this room- this turquoise-and-chrome disaster of a room.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s classy and sophisticated.
 <br>
 You know, maybe you&#39;re the one who has bad taste.
 <br>
 In fact- Why don&#39;t you tell me about this pea-soup-colored chair? I think it&#39;s comfortable and soothing, just like pea soup.
 <br>
 Well, I think this whole room is a great example of bad taste.
 <br>
 - Excuse me? - Uh, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I have spent years picking every item in this room so that I would be surrounded by the things I love and the people I thought loved me.
 <br>
 Hey, Kitty? How about a nap? And you.
 <br>
 Have you fixed the damn clicker yet? What good is a clicker if it won&#39;t click? Oh, my goodness.
 <br>
 I am flying right off the handle.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Seems to me you&#39;re just as pleasant as always.
 <br>
 Ooh, that is sweet.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;d like to take a nap now.
 <br>
 Wha- Did you see that? I told you the truth, and we got into a fight.
 <br>
 My dad told my mom she&#39;s pleasant- a whopper of a lie- and they&#39;ve been married 1 50 years.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I want you to tell me the truth all the time.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like when women ask whether or not their outfit makes them look fat.
 <br>
 How many men tell them they look fat? Zero.
 <br>
 How many women look fat? Not zero.
 <br>
 That is totally different.
 <br>
 No, Donna.
 <br>
 No, it isn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Look, how could I look you in the eye and tell you that I don&#39;t like the ring when I love you so much? I guess I know what you mean.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like when you wrote me that song.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 You love that song.
 <br>
 Of course I do.
 <br>
 You know what? We are really bad with rings.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 If we ever get married, we should just exchange, like buckets of chicken.
 <br>
 Or, uh, I- I could write you another song.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine with chicken.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Does this outfit make my butt look fat? No.
 <br>
 You look super.
 <br>
 So, uh.
 <br>
 Wonder Boy and I are thinking about movin&#39; in together.
 <br>
 My parents are gonna freak! - You think your parents are gonna freak? - Yeah, we&#39;re twins.
 <br>
 It really hurts my feelings that you call me Dr.
 <br>
 Bald.
 <br>
 Just because I&#39;m evil doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t cry.
 <br>
 Super jerks!
 <br>
