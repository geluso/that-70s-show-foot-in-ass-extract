<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, is everyone ready for our big trip to the University of Wisconsin? Yeah, Donna and I have it all mapped out.
 <br>
 She is going to buy a tight sweater with a big, red &#39;&#39;W&#39;&#39; on it, and I am going to watch her wear it.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) And then we&#39;re gonna buckle down.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, I put out some clean clothes for you to take on the trip.
 <br>
 Uh, thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, but I&#39;m not really the college type.
 <br>
 I get my learnin&#39; on the street.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re a smart kid.
 <br>
 If you would only just apply yourself -you could go to college too.
 <br>
 - You don&#39;t trust me alone in the house, do you? See how smart you are? Well, I just can&#39;t believe my baby is all grown up and visiting college! I am so freakin&#39; old! And menopause makes another unwelcome appearance at the dinner table.
 <br>
 Oh, no, it&#39;s not unwelcome.
 <br>
 It&#39;s- It&#39;s liberating.
 <br>
 Now my emotions just spill out.
 <br>
 Yeah, Mom.
 <br>
 You&#39;re sweating all over your pork chop.
 <br>
 Hey! There&#39;s my favorite coed.
 <br>
 - Hey, are you all packed for Visitors Weekend? - I can&#39;t go.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s makin&#39; me visit Marquette instead.
 <br>
 He thinks it&#39;s a better school, &#39;cause it&#39;s private.
 <br>
 Oh, and &#39;cause it sounds French.
 <br>
 Well, you know what? We&#39;ll just go with you.
 <br>
 I mean, if it&#39;s a better school then I belong there too, right, Dad? No.
 <br>
 State schools are cheap.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where you belong.
 <br>
 Well, what if, like, you took out a second mortgage on the house? ( Both Laughing ) Not for you, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) ( Sighs ) I have a bad feeling about this weekend, Eric.
 <br>
 Nothing good can come from us visiting different schools.
 <br>
 Well, yeah, but there&#39;s an upside.
 <br>
 Two days apart? I mean, when we get together it&#39;s gonna be electric, baby! Like a thunderstorm.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m serious! I mean, what if we actually end up going to different colleges? And we&#39;re apart for four years? Then, come semester break, you better board up your windows.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause guess what? Here comes Hurricane Eric.
 <br>
 Board up my windows? What are my windows? - And whatever they are, wouldn&#39;t you want them open? - Hmm.
 <br>
 Look, Donna.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m saying is that I think we can get through anything.
 <br>
 We go to different schools now, and we&#39;re fine because our love is strong.
 <br>
 Like a big, burly bear.
 <br>
 So zip up your tent, &#39;cause guess what.
 <br>
 This bear has claws.
 <br>
 - Again, wouldn&#39;t you want my tent open? - Mmm.
 <br>
 Hold it, you two.
 <br>
 Now, before we hit the road we need to have a talk about that horrible thing that&#39;s taken over your mother.
 <br>
 You mean, her &#39;&#39;change of life&#39;&#39;? Thought we were calling it &#39;&#39;the lady-parts problem.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; It goes by many names.
 <br>
 Now, we&#39;re dealing with a tricky enemy here.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t been this frosty since Korea.
 <br>
 And just like a commie it can jump out and attack you at any moment.
 <br>
 - ( Kitty ) Red, honey.
 <br>
 ! - Incoming! ( Eric ) Retreat! Red, um, you know, I&#39;ve been a tad bit moody lately.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) So, um if you don&#39;t want me to go on this trip, I&#39;ll understand.
 <br>
 Well, you know, honey, there&#39;s really no need for you to go.
 <br>
 I knew you didn&#39;t want me to go! Well, I am going, whether you like it or not.
 <br>
 Why is it so damn hot in here? It&#39;s like it&#39;s- It&#39;s like we&#39;re living in hell! You can say that again.
 <br>
 So, Steven? When I go to Marquette with Donna this weekend there&#39;ll be lots of cute boys around.
 <br>
 Lucky you.
 <br>
 Well, unlucky them, because I won&#39;t let them kiss me.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s my promise to you.
 <br>
 Now, I&#39;m not saying you have to promise me anything.
 <br>
 But if you want to, now would be a good time.
 <br>
 Okay, well,just know that I won&#39;t be kissing anyone.
 <br>
 Good to know.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Good to know&#39;&#39;? That&#39;s it? Did I stutter? Oh, thanks for the help.
 <br>
 You seem to have a natural talent for handling luggage.
 <br>
 Red? Honey.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m sorry about our little spat.
 <br>
 - The last thing I want to do is ruin our trip.
 <br>
 - Oh, sweetheart, that&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) - ( Chuckling ) - Wow, Mom certainly cheered up.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t be fooled.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a ticking time bomb.
 <br>
 Hey! Wait up! What do you want? The explanation&#39;s pinned to my lapel.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Dear Red.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Kelso and I are unable to take Michael to U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s $30 so he can go with you.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - Where&#39;s the 30 bucks? - Oh, I bought this &#39;&#39;electronical&#39;&#39; football game.
 <br>
 I swear to God, Kelso! You make Eric look like Einstein.
 <br>
 Thank you, Daddy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Thank you&#39;&#39;? Einstein was ugly.
 <br>
 Oh! It&#39;s like a sauna in here.
 <br>
 Wish you didn&#39;t all have to breathe so much.
 <br>
 All right, guys.
 <br>
 You heard the lady.
 <br>
 No more breathing! No, I didn&#39;t tell you not to breathe, I asked you not to breathe as much.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a difference.
 <br>
 ! ( Softly ) To crazy people.
 <br>
 Hey, Ali Baba.
 <br>
 Close sesame.
 <br>
 - Oh! Red! You just missed the exit.
 <br>
 - Oh, damn it! Eric, you&#39;re supposed to be following the map.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing back there? Makin&#39; you a crown? &#39;Cause you&#39;re &#39;&#39;King of the Road&#39;&#39;! - I need to use the bathroom.
 <br>
 - Can you turn up the radio? - First and goal! - How much further? - ( Electronic Game Warbles ) - Touchdown! Would you all just shut up? ( Sighs ) This is stupid.
 <br>
 I mean, why am I looking at a school I don&#39;t even want to go to? ( Sighs ) Should&#39;ve gone to U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 with Eric.
 <br>
 And I should&#39;ve laughed at his thunderstorm jokes.
 <br>
 You know, I bet those sluts at U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 will laugh at them.
 <br>
 Sluts! What, U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 has sluts? Steven loves sluts! He&#39;s not gonna do anything.
 <br>
 He&#39;s with you now.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if he is or not.
 <br>
 I mean, look.
 <br>
 Last week, he called me his girlfriend.
 <br>
 And then this week, I couldn&#39;t even trick him into promising me he wouldn&#39;t fool around with someone else.
 <br>
 And I was very passive-aggressive.
 <br>
 I believe that.
 <br>
 Donna, I promised to be faithful.
 <br>
 And all he said was, &#39;&#39;Good to know.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Good to know, &#39;&#39; Donna! You know, I am too depressed to go to orientation with you.
 <br>
 Steven crushed my spirit, and now there&#39;s only one place I can turn to.
 <br>
 Please, God, don&#39;t let it be me.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 The cheerleading demonstration.
 <br>
 I mean, at first, when they yell, &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got spirit, how &#39;bout you?&#39;&#39; Well, of course, I&#39;ll have to say no! But- But show me a human pyramid and a really sharp pom-pom waterfall and I&#39;ll get it back.
 <br>
 ( House P.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 : Rock ) What the hell kind of college is this? Barefoot hippies playin&#39; Frisbee barefoot hippies singin&#39; songs to trees- Man, this place is awesome! Look, they even have dirty cartoons on the wall.
 <br>
 Kelso, those are C.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 R.
 <br>
 instructions.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Wow, I&#39;ve done C.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 R.
 <br>
 a lot.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Ted, resident adviser.
 <br>
 - Hi.
 <br>
 - Why don&#39;t you folks have a look around and I&#39;ll show the boys where they&#39;re gonna be staying.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know about this place.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll say.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the middle of November.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t see any Thanksgiving decorations.
 <br>
 Visitors Weekend is great.
 <br>
 We always have a big dorm party, tons of beer, tons of chicks.
 <br>
 Hey, I just need one six-pack and two chicks, and I&#39;m good.
 <br>
 Man, this place is great! It&#39;s too bad Donna couldn&#39;t make it.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, would you look at that? We just saw college butt! On a girl! - Hold it.
 <br>
 Girls live here too? - Yes, sir.
 <br>
 We&#39;re coed.
 <br>
 - ( Clamoring ) - ( Kelso ) Oh, nice! That&#39;s it! You&#39;re staying with us at the motel.
 <br>
 Wait! Dad, wait.
 <br>
 Think of what a valuable experience this could be for me.
 <br>
 I mean, this is my first step into the real world.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) I&#39;m your little bird, Dad.
 <br>
 Give me wings to fly.
 <br>
 ! Butch it up and get in the car.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 This is your C.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 R.
 <br>
 coach.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna need to check your lung capacities! ( Laughing ) That means their boobs.
 <br>
 ( Game Beeping, Chirping ) There&#39;s got to be at least one all-male dormitory on this campus.
 <br>
 Ha! Here it is.
 <br>
 Right in between the chapel and the School of Interior Design.
 <br>
 ( Clicks Tongue ) Boys, um- um, I realize that, uh I may have been a little irrational today.
 <br>
 - A little? - ( Screams ) Shut up! So, um, maybe now is a good time for me to explain a few things to you about menopause.
 <br>
 And, um, lucky for you, I&#39;m a nurse, so I can use the proper terms, like - &#39;&#39;epithelial lining&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;uterine wall.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - ( Eric Groans ) I&#39;m hooked.
 <br>
 Okay, so.
 <br>
 Um, now.
 <br>
 Say these soaps are my ovaries.
 <br>
 Kill me now.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t hear ya, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m on a beach in Florida.
 <br>
 Okay, um, about a month ago - they stopped producing- - ( Game Beeping ) - they stopped- - ( Beeping ) - stopped producing- - ( Chirping ) That&#39;s it! ( Crashing ) What is wrong with you? Were you dropped on your head? Yes, I was! And up until now, everyone had the good grace not to mention it.
 <br>
 - Okay, boys.
 <br>
 Time to leave.
 <br>
 - Yes! Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman? I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I washed my face with your ovaries.
 <br>
 Get out.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s a great beard.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never made out with a guy with a beard.
 <br>
 Well, this could be your lucky day.
 <br>
 - You want to go to my room? - Absolutely.
 <br>
 You know what? I-I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 But if you change your mind, a few of us girls will be in the shower.
 <br>
 I can go! My name is Fez! Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t see me! Man, what the hell did I just do? I just turned down a sure thing because ofJackie.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t know what she&#39;s doin&#39; at Marquette.
 <br>
 Or who.
 <br>
 Man, she said she wouldn&#39;t do anything.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I bet if she did, you&#39;d cry because you love her.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t shut up, you&#39;ll be the first person to touch his chin to his ass.
 <br>
 Have you been spying on me? I see U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 has a pretty good C.
 <br>
 P.
 <br>
 R.
 <br>
 program.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be my major.
 <br>
 So, I told my girlfriend, &#39;&#39;We can go to separate schools.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - I mean, people do that all the time, right? - Yeah.
 <br>
 My boyfriend goes to school in New York, and we&#39;ve been together for three years.
 <br>
 - And we&#39;re in love now more than ever.
 <br>
 - Of course you are.
 <br>
 And I bet when you two get together, it&#39;s like a thunderstorm, right? Hey, pretty lady.
 <br>
 Hey, excuse me.
 <br>
 Hello? - Didn&#39;t you just say you had a boyfriend? - Yeah.
 <br>
 But he&#39;s not here.
 <br>
 Did you just see that? I told Donna we could go to different schools and I was extremely wrong, and- Man, if she doesn&#39;t hate Marquette, we&#39;re screwed.
 <br>
 Who cares, man? I just turned down a half-drunk college girl.
 <br>
 I&#39;m pretty sure she knew how to do stuff.
 <br>
 Eric? Is everything okay? Yeah.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 I just wanted to see how you liked Marquette.
 <br>
 And, can I just say, if that snooty switchboard operator&#39;s attitude is any indication of the Marquette experience, then- ( Chuckles ) I can only assume we&#39;re crossing Marquette off the list right now.
 <br>
 No, actually, it&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Okay, they have this English professor.
 <br>
 He wears a beret and a corduroy jacket, but he listens to Zeppelin! Uh, yeah, well, U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 has a vending machine, so- ( Scoffing ) - Donna, I love you.
 <br>
 - I love you too.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 ( TV Show Theme ) ( Sobbing ) You gonna cry now too? You know who had a real family? The Waltons.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just three strangers sitting in a room! - ( Door Closes ) - Donna loves it there.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing any of us can do.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all screwed.
 <br>
 You think I like being stuck here nursing my lunatic wife back from the brink? Hell, no.
 <br>
 But we can&#39;t control what happens to us.
 <br>
 Even if, by some stroke of luck, you actually hang on to Donna eventually, she&#39;s gonna turn into that.
 <br>
 And then, a few years later, you&#39;ll die.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Thanks for the bedtime story.
 <br>
 Donna? I hate it here, and I want to go home.
 <br>
 Wait, what&#39;s wrong? Was there a height requirement for the cheerleading team? No, it was awful! And when the cheerleaders were yelling, &#39;&#39;Go, team, go&#39;&#39; all I was hearing was Steven saying, &#39;&#39;Good to know.
 <br>
 Good to know!&#39;&#39; Jackie, your problem is, is you&#39;re always trying to force people into doing stuff.
 <br>
 Oh! I do not, Donna.
 <br>
 Now, you feel sorry for me right now.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t make someone like Hyde do anything.
 <br>
 You have to deal with him the way he deals with you.
 <br>
 Look, pretend you don&#39;t care what he does, and he&#39;ll come around.
 <br>
 Well, I guess it&#39;s worth a try.
 <br>
 You know, being with a real man is complicated.
 <br>
 You are so lucky you&#39;re with Eric.
 <br>
 What? What a wonderful weekend! We should go away more often! They gotta make a pill for this.
 <br>
 Oh, Hyde, I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you.
 <br>
 ( Singsongy ) Hyde and Jackie, sitting in a tree.
 <br>
 They&#39;re in love like two monkeys.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) Would you shut up, Fez? That&#39;s not even how it goes.
 <br>
 - Well, is it making you mad? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Well, then, that&#39;s how it goes.
 <br>
 - ( Clinks ) - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Look,Jackie.
 <br>
 I know you were worried before so, I just want to let you know nothin&#39; happened on my end this weekend.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not tellin&#39; you that so you&#39;ll tell me what you did.
 <br>
 I just want to let you know what happened with me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my report to you.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Good to know.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;Good to know&#39;&#39;? - D-Did I stutter? - Hi.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 I know you love Marquette, and I made my peace with that.
 <br>
 So if that means we&#39;re gonna go to separate schools and drift apart and make out with guys named Ted, then- That&#39;s just the way it&#39;s gonna be, because you&#39;re gonna get menopause and I&#39;m gonna die, and we can&#39;t control anything that happens to us! - I&#39;m not going to Marquette.
 <br>
 - Well, then never mind.
 <br>
 I mean, Eric- I loved it, and when I was driving home I was so excited to tell you about it and then the drive took forever.
 <br>
 And I realized, that&#39;s how far away I&#39;d be from you all the time.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t want that.
 <br>
 So I&#39;ll just tell my dad I want to go to U.
 <br>
 W.
 <br>
 with you.
 <br>
 Donna, you have no idea - how happy you just made me.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) Eric, this is gonna be great! We&#39;re gonna be together all the time.
 <br>
 Oh, um- ( Clicks Tongue ) -you&#39;re not gonna get all clingy, right? - ( Laughs ) - Shut up.
 <br>
 - Now, come on.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be a big college man.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m gonna need my space.
 <br>
 What do you want? Once again, the explanation is pinned to my lapel.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Dear Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Please give Michael $30 &#39;&#39;for the game you threw out the window and broke.
 <br>
 Signed, my parents.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughs ) Well, you made her laugh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s worth 30 bucks.
