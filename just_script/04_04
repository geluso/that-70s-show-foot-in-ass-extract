 <br>
 ( Game Show Theme On TV) - ( Sighs ) - ( Applause On TV) Donna loved Hollywood Squares.
 <br>
 Ah, Forman.
 <br>
 Come on, man.
 <br>
 Give it a rest, huh? So you&#39;re single now.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good thing.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re like me, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re free to be with lotsa subpar, somewhat sleazy chicks.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Christmas, baby.
 <br>
 Oh, you disguise your heart, Hyde, but I know you need love.
 <br>
 - Why is that? - &#39;Cause I need it.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m goin&#39; to work before you two start braidin&#39; each other&#39;s hair.
 <br>
 ( Door Opens, Closes ) You know what? I wish for once Hyde would fall in love, you know? So we could make fun of him.
 <br>
 We&#39;d be all, &#39;&#39;Hey, everyone&#39;&#39;- ( Mouths Words ) &#39;&#39;Hyde&#39;s in love.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Chortles ) Burn.
 <br>
 Oh, I know.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get Hyde a woman.
 <br>
 We can have a &#39;&#39;Let&#39;s Get Hyde a Woman&#39;&#39; party.
 <br>
 And-And we can have food and music and, um- - Women? - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Hey, this party is a great idea.
 <br>
 I am gonna find the perfect match for Steven.
 <br>
 After all, my nickname is &#39;&#39;The Queen of Romance.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; No one calls you that.
 <br>
 Now, we will each bring no less than two and no more than five girls to the party for Hyde, okay? I will console the rejects with a hot oil massage.
 <br>
 I will be nude.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m outta here.
 <br>
 The radio station&#39;s giving away a van, and I gotta work.
 <br>
 I will be clothed.
 <br>
 Well, I think it&#39;s a great idea.
 <br>
 Steven is almost a man, and he needs to meet a girl who will help him find his way.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Yeah.
 <br>
 A girl helped me find my way to hell! I&#39;m in hell.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re not in hell.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re too hot, take off your sweater.
 <br>
 - So, it&#39;s settled.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll have the party here.
 <br>
 - No, Kitty.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talkin&#39; about, but, no.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 We&#39;re-We&#39;re havin&#39; a little party for Steven, so he can meet his Miss Right.
 <br>
 Why is it here? Why is it always here? Well, what do you want them to do, have the party in the street? Yes.
 <br>
 They puke in the street, the city cleans it up.
 <br>
 Oh-ho, man! ( Giggling ) Oh, I hope I win this van.
 <br>
 I really need a place to do it with Jackie.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Listen up everybody.
 <br>
 The rules are simple.
 <br>
 You place one hand on the van.
 <br>
 If you remove your hand for any reason, you&#39;re out.
 <br>
 Last person to remove his hand wins the van.
 <br>
 Any questions? You&#39;re out.
 <br>
 Any other questions? - Don&#39;t start without me, Max.
 <br>
 - Oh, God.
 <br>
 Hello.
 <br>
 My name is Daniel and I have won every WFPP contest since the Weber Gas Grill Trampoline Bounce of 1 972.
 <br>
 I am unbeatable, so the choice is yours: joy or despair pleasure or pain life or death.
 <br>
 ( Spits ) I am Daniel! And I cannot be beaten.
 <br>
 ( Man Singing Rock ) ( Stereo:Rock Continues ) Look at what I brought.
 <br>
 - Big Rhonda? - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 There goes the keg.
 <br>
 Everybody, look who&#39;s here- a caring, intelligent, snazzy young man- Ste-e-even Hyde! Um, thanks.
 <br>
 Hey, man.
 <br>
 What&#39;s goin&#39; on? I thought we were watchin&#39; Saturday Night Live.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Change of plans.
 <br>
 We&#39;re havin&#39; a party with girls, a keg and girls.
 <br>
 - For no reason whatsoever.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 - And there&#39;s no agenda.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Stop grilling me, you bastard! Oh, hey, Melissa.
 <br>
 - How&#39;s the contest going? - Lame.
 <br>
 But at least the boneheads are entertaining.
 <br>
 Check out that idiot&#39;s &#39;fro.
 <br>
 Hey, that&#39;s my dad.
 <br>
 - Oh! Uh- - No.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) - ( Laughs ) - So, hey, what are you doin&#39; tonight? - We&#39;re in Wisconsin so nothing.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m goin&#39; to this party.
 <br>
 It&#39;s in a stinky basement, and they&#39;ll have a stolen keg.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 - Cool.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad.
 <br>
 I brought you some mints and your afro pick.
 <br>
 Oh, thank God, Donna.
 <br>
 My hair was startin&#39; to look silly.
 <br>
 Hey, check out the redhead.
 <br>
 That redhead is my baby girl Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;m her dad.
 <br>
 I want Donna to call me &#39;&#39;Daddy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - ( Sputters ) That&#39;s it! - Ah! Bob.
 <br>
 You took your hand off the van.
 <br>
 You lose.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t over.
 <br>
 It is for you.
 <br>
 ( Quietly ) Get outta here.
 <br>
 And so begins the battle of wits.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never been good at wits.
 <br>
 - Really? - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 So, chips and dip, huh? Yeah.
 <br>
 And the words kinda sound alike, so that&#39;s always fun.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 No offense, but I&#39;m really not in the mood for talking.
 <br>
 I just broke up with my girlfriend, so- Oh, you poor thing.
 <br>
 You know, you have these sad lips that are just so hot.
 <br>
 Really? I may not be popular, but if given the chance, I&#39;ll put out somethin&#39; fierce.
 <br>
 Psst! Psst! How&#39;s it goin&#39;? Great, great, great, great.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause, see, at first, I thought I should wear my hair up.
 <br>
 But- ( Snorts ) let&#39;s be honest.
 <br>
 My hair is one of my top five features.
 <br>
 So, voila! It&#39;s down.
 <br>
 Psst! Psst! Hyde, allow me to introduce you to a special lady.
 <br>
 So we meet every week to pray and discuss Scripture.
 <br>
 You in? I used to date your dad.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that a turn-on? It&#39;s not like head cheerleader&#39;s always the most talented but in my case, it&#39;s true.
 <br>
 I have to date guys who aren&#39;t as good-looking as me, otherwise, I&#39;d never date.
 <br>
 You gonna eat that? I know you&#39;re really angry and emotionally crippled but that&#39;s okay, &#39;cause my boyfriend&#39;s in jail.
 <br>
 My turn-offs include people who are mean to puppies and people who smoke or don&#39;t smoke? Or smoke? Wait.
 <br>
 Do you smoke? Okay.
 <br>
 So guess which leg&#39;s real.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so glad I finally got to meet you, &#39;cause I&#39;ve, like, always been afraid of you and I like to be scared.
 <br>
 So? What do you think? You know, I think, if I time this right I can nail every single one of these girls tonight.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 You&#39;re supposed to pick just one- to love, not nail.
 <br>
 Love.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Listen to me,Johnny Cool.
 <br>
 I threw this party for you, so you can find one girlfriend to love you.
 <br>
 And that is all.
 <br>
 One.
 <br>
 - You set this up? - Yeah.
 <br>
 We all thought you needed help finding a quality woman.
 <br>
 What? Man, you sit around and talk about me? Is that what&#39;s goin&#39; on? Look.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want your help.
 <br>
 I give and I do, and I do and I give.
 <br>
 And for what? For nothing.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m done.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 - But, Fez- - I said, go.
 <br>
 - Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 This is Melissa.
 <br>
 She just moved here from Chicago.
 <br>
 Work at the radio station together.
 <br>
 - Melissa, this is Hyde.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) You&#39;re not leaving already, are you? - Uh, no.
 <br>
 I came out to get some fresh air.
 <br>
 - ( Donna ) Oh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, uh- It&#39;s fresher out here- the air.
 <br>
 I like air.
 <br>
 How &#39;bout you? Air&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You know what&#39;s really good? Water.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) That&#39;s really- ( Chuckles ) ( Clears Throat ) This summer I&#39;m gonna visit my aunt in Mississippi.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re goin&#39; away? That is sad.
 <br>
 Hey, you should come with me, chocolate milk.
 <br>
 When I looked across the room, I saw a guy who was wounded- a guy who sits in the dark waiting for the light to find him again.
 <br>
 If only I could find this light you speak of then maybe-just maybe- my pain might go away.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) Would it help if I held you? I doubt it.
 <br>
 But let&#39;s try, Katie.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Lower.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I am so disgusted.
 <br>
 Oh, I know.
 <br>
 There are way too many girls at this party.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even smell my own perfume.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re the only one.
 <br>
 You know, you may not even be the prettiest girl here.
 <br>
 You shut your hole.
 <br>
 ( Thinking ) I am pretty! Unsure.
 <br>
 Must find Michael! Hi.
 <br>
 You know I&#39;m a guy who&#39;s wounded.
 <br>
 - So I&#39;m gonna go grab a beer.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 Get one for yourself too.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I- Ca- - Can I get you a beer? - There you go.
 <br>
 - Thanks.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 A toast to all my good friends.
 <br>
 I will miss you when I blow out of this burg with the beautiful Big Rhonda.
 <br>
 ( Scattered Applause ) Now it&#39;s off to &#39;&#39;Missis-syphilis&#39;&#39;! Oh, no.
 <br>
 Red, they&#39;ve been drinking.
 <br>
 Well, well.
 <br>
 What do ya know? Here, Kelso.
 <br>
 Thought you might need some coffee to keep you goin&#39;.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what would be fun? - Seein&#39; which one of us could drink the most coffee, huh? - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 - You&#39;ll just lose.
 <br>
 - Wha- No.
 <br>
 I would not.
 <br>
 - I could so beat you.
 <br>
 - Well, I doubt that.
 <br>
 - Oh, you&#39;re goin&#39; down.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s my six to your one! - Yeah.
 <br>
 Ya really whipped me.
 <br>
 Kelso, have you ever been to Niagara Falls? - Uh-uh.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you like the soothing sound of water? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I guess.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 You ever sat beside a babbling brook listening to the beautiful, steady stream of water? Well, I- Okay.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if you realize this, but a-all this talk about water is really making have to go pee.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I can see that &#39;&#39;urine&#39;&#39; a lot of pain.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, y-you better shut up, &#39;cause you&#39;re gonna have to go too.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong.
 <br>
 I am going.
 <br>
 I know I just met her, Mr.
 <br>
 Red but I love her.
 <br>
 She is sturdy.
 <br>
 I want to climb her.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just desperate to give it away, aren&#39;t you, son? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I am.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) There are two things that you need to learn about women.
 <br>
 Oh, finally, the sex talk! ( Chuckles ) First: If a woman outweighs you by 30 pounds you&#39;re in for trouble.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ll put on weight.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll bridge the gap.
 <br>
 Which brings me to my second point.
 <br>
 - When used separately, women and alcohol can be a lot of fun.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) But if you mix &#39;em, they can turn you into a dumb-ass.
 <br>
 - Michael! -Jackie.
 <br>
 - I thought you were at the party.
 <br>
 - No, no, no.
 <br>
 It was awful.
 <br>
 Do you know what it&#39;s like to be the prettiest girl at a party and not have anyone acknowledge it? Yes, I do.
 <br>
 - Michael, am I pretty? - Oh, come on, cupcake.
 <br>
 - You are the prettiest girl in Point Place.
 <br>
 - ( Giggles ) No.
 <br>
 You know what? In Wisconsin.
 <br>
 Nice one, Pinocchio.
 <br>
 - Am I prettier than Pam Macy? - ( Scoffs ) Of course.
 <br>
 Am I prettier than Farrah Fawcett? ( Stammering ) Oh, all right.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 She&#39;s like a perfect 1 0.
 <br>
 And you are an 1 1 .
 <br>
 - Am I prettier than- - Oh, my God! Am I prettier than the girl with the feathered hair at the supermarket? Okay, okay, the blonde-haired one or the brown-haired one? Well, does it matter? No, &#39;cause ya smoke &#39;em both, baby! - ( Giggles ) Am I prettier than- - Oh, my God! I can&#39;t take it anymore! ( Mockingly ) Am I pretty? Am I pretty? Am I pretty? Shut up! And we finally have a winner.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) I did it! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I won! Who&#39;s the best? I&#39;m the best! Loser! I&#39;m not a loser, okay? I win everything.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t lose.
 <br>
 I win! Because I&#39;m a winner! ( Whining ) I&#39;m a winner! So, Michael Kelso, tell Wisconsin how it feels to be WFPP&#39;s new Hand 2 Van winner! Well, I guess I have to say it like this, Max: If this van&#39;s a-rockin&#39; we&#39;re in there doin&#39; it! - Michael! - Oh.
 <br>
 Um, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m doin&#39; it with Jackie Burkhart! If you really think putting my head on your lap will make me feel better I mean, I guess I should try.
 <br>
 ( Mouthing Words ) All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 Excuse me, girls.
 <br>
 I have some information- No.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t listen to what she&#39;s- I&#39;m- She&#39;s the one who hurt me.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 He dumped me.
 <br>
 You dumped her? Well, I had to.
 <br>
 She wouldn&#39;t- She wouldn&#39;t take my ring.
 <br>
 ( Gasps ) You wouldn&#39;t take his ring? This is none of your business.
 <br>
 And you are a sad little man.
 <br>
 Tsk.
 <br>
 Oh, poor baby.
 <br>
 - Do you want my number? - Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I do.
 <br>
 - So, you havin&#39; fun? - That reminds me.
 <br>
 I have to go.
 <br>
 Uh, Melissa um, I was wonderin&#39; if maybe you wanted to do somethin&#39; sometime.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 I did something last night, and I already made plans for sometime.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Wait, wait.
 <br>
 Uh, let me try that again.
 <br>
 Um, look.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re not doing anything Friday night I&#39;d like to take you out to, uh- to- to dinner and a movie.
 <br>
 Pizza? The mall? Bowling? I&#39;d love to.
 <br>
 Call me.
 <br>
 Call you? ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s a little unorthodox.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll call you.
 <br>
 - ( Door Opens, Closes ) - Ye-e-es.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll call you.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll call you.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Scoffs ) Whipped.
 <br>
 What? I don&#39;t care about her.
 <br>
 Melissa who? What the hell.
 <br>
 Whipped like the family pig.
 <br>
 Rhonda, I cannot go to Mississippi.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re not coming? I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 But maybe we can go to the movies sometime.
 <br>
 And make out in the theater? Yeah! Call me.
 <br>
 - Good God.
 <br>
 Sober up, man.
 <br>
 - ( Door Opens, Closes ) Oh, screw it, Donna.
 <br>
 Fez likes them big.
 <br>
 Fez likes them small.
 <br>
 Fez likes them all.
