<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey, Donna, now that we have our wedding rings and you can&#39;t back out, I have something that I want to confess.
 <br>
 I want to do the bunny hop at our wedding.
 <br>
 I&#39;m good at it, and I don&#39;t get to show it off that often.
 <br>
 Okay, but I want to walk into the reception under an archway of cupcakes.
 <br>
 Ooh, deal.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t look! Turn away! Whoa.
 <br>
 What? What? Oh.
 <br>
 Did you get me a present? Is it bongo drums? No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want you to see my wedding dress.
 <br>
 It&#39;s bad luck.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t having sex before the wedding the bad luck thing? Well, that too.
 <br>
 Eric, getting married is like one big minefield.
 <br>
 One false step, and limbs just flying everywhere.
 <br>
 Well, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t see your wedding dress, so so I think we just saved ourselves some bad luck.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s take that credit that we&#39;ve earned and use it to have sex.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 We can&#39;t lose.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be like playing with the house&#39;s money.
 <br>
 Eric, if we broke our celibacy vow now, what would it say about us? It would say, &#34;yay! We had sex!&#34; All right, fine.
 <br>
 Can we look at our ring inscriptions, or is that bad luck, too? Well, no, that I have to look at so I can return it in case you wrote something stupid.
 <br>
 &#34;To Eric, love Donna.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, it&#39;s not stupid.
 <br>
 It&#39;s short.
 <br>
 It&#39;s terse.
 <br>
 Quite possibly even a little rude.
 <br>
 &#34;All my friends know the low rider.
 <br>
 &#34; Um, I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 Am I the low rider? Wait.
 <br>
 What do you mean all your friends know me? Are you saying I&#39;m a whore? No, no, Donna.
 <br>
 &#34;Low rider&#34; is the song that was playing in the car at the end of our first date.
 <br>
 Remember, you wore that red dress, and at the end of the night, I kissed you, and I remember thinking I justyou know, I just can&#39;t believe she&#39;s with me.
 <br>
 Eric, that is the most romantic thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
 <br>
 Take your pants off.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the most romantic thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 6 Episode 22 &#34;Sparks&#34; Fellas, I convinced Donna to break her celibacy vow, which in laymen&#39;s terms means I&#39;m a layman.
 <br>
 Damn, Forman, got your girlfriend to have sex with you? What is your secret? Okay, you guys, it&#39;s a big deal.
 <br>
 Have either of you ever slept with my girlfriend? No, but I&#39;ve done it with Hyde&#39;s girlfriend.
 <br>
 And I was good.
 <br>
 Well, just what the heck is this? What a great auction! Red had a few beers and bought a canoe.
 <br>
 I bought a canoe! Who would&#39;ve thought me and Red go out and he&#39;s the one to buy something stupid? I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m gonna put this.
 <br>
 Red, why would you buy a canoe? I think the question is why haven&#39;t I before? But we can&#39;t afford this.
 <br>
 Sure we can.
 <br>
 I used the money that you gave me yesterday.
 <br>
 That was for Eric&#39;s wedding present.
 <br>
 Congratulations, Eric.
 <br>
 I knew you always wanted a canoe.
 <br>
 Fine, Red.
 <br>
 Since you blew the money, I expect you to come up with a nice sentimental gift for Eric that doesn&#39;t cost anything.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s what you get for going out and drinking.
 <br>
 Maybe one day you&#39;ll learn to stay at home and drink, like me.
 <br>
 Hey, boys.
 <br>
 I bought a canoe.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 I just left my coat here after Donna and I well, I&#39;m sure she already filled you in on all the juicy details.
 <br>
 Yeah, heard all about your little leg cramp.
 <br>
 Hey, I can turn a leg cramp into magic! Ehh she just doesn&#39;t get me.
 <br>
 Oh, no, Donna&#39;s wedding dress.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s wedding dress.
 <br>
 Bad luck.
 <br>
 Bad voodoo.
 <br>
 Please.
 <br>
 Give me a break.
 <br>
 A well, boys, thanks to our time here in the circle, I&#39;ve come up with a perfectly rational way to keep Donna from finding out that I tore her dress.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna destroy the earth.
 <br>
 Okay, well, first you gotta go to another planet and then you gotta build a giant a death ray and aim it at the earth.
 <br>
 That&#39;s pretty complicated.
 <br>
 I can lend you my sketches if you want.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a great plan.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like so many of our ideas sound good in the circle, but later on they just sound stupid.
 <br>
 But a death ray it&#39;s awesome.
 <br>
 Fez, stop smelling the dress.
 <br>
 Hey, either I do this now, or I do it at the reception.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your choice.
 <br>
 So Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman told me to get this thing out of her sight.
 <br>
 Now that could mean put it in the garage, leave it out for the garbageman.
 <br>
 I like to think it meant, &#34;hey, have a free canoe.
 <br>
 &#34; And the three of us with a canoe, we&#39;ll be unstoppable.
 <br>
 What should we do with it? Let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 What could we do with a canoe that would make people say, &#34;oh, no, what&#39;s wrong with them?&#34; Oh! Oh! I know what we could do today that&#39;s gonna be really fun.
 <br>
 Kelso, the last time you said that, we had to get your stomach pumped.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 Hey, so, uh, how do you plan on steering this thing on land? Duh.
 <br>
 Kelso, I think you should wear a helmet just in case anything goes wrong.
 <br>
 Fez, I&#39;m riding an open canoe down a rocky mountainside.
 <br>
 What could possibly go wrong? I think I&#39;m with Fez on this helmet thing.
 <br>
 Oh, no, I&#39;m not falling for that one.
 <br>
 Falling for what? The old helmet gag.
 <br>
 Kelso, I just want you to protect your head from being crushed like a berry.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you? Now let go of the ropes and watch me fly! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, man.
 <br>
 Stupid thing.
 <br>
 Oh, man, that.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 that could&#39;ve been me! I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s &#34;the low rider&#34;? That&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Then I think he&#39;s calling you a whore.
 <br>
 Oh, my god! My dress! Yeah, doesn&#39;t look so good in daylight, does it? No, it&#39;s gone.
 <br>
 Did you move it? I didn&#39;t touch it.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric was here earlier.
 <br>
 Maybe he did something with it.
 <br>
 Why are you always blaming Eric for everything? Oh, well, somebody has to, or he&#39;ll just go through life thinking there&#39;s nothing wrong I know what I could give Eric that&#39;s sentimental.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 my old baseball glove.
 <br>
 Red, anything related to sports will only remind Eric of the things he doesn&#39;t do well.
 <br>
 Oh, fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just go down to the space toy and smart mouth store.
 <br>
 psst! Mom.
 <br>
 Mom, is Donna here? No.
 <br>
 Why are we whispering? You tore her dress? Yeah, see, that would have been a really good thing to whisper! All right, well, it doesn&#39;t look too bad.
 <br>
 I think I can fix it.
 <br>
 Put it down.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get my sewing box.
 <br>
 Mom, thank you.
 <br>
 Not on the shoe polish! What have you done, you bony bastards?! Okay, okay.
 <br>
 I think I can clean it, but we have to act fast.
 <br>
 - Okay, go, go, go, go.
 <br>
 - Go, go, go Please tell me that sound was a rip in the space-time continuum.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m gonna need some club soda, a little lemon juice and some vodka.
 <br>
 To get the stain out? No, to think straight.
 <br>
 Eric! Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s coming.
 <br>
 Have you seen my wedding dress? Whoa.
 <br>
 You lost the wedding dress? What happens when we have a kid? You gonna lose that, too? Oh, my god.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll find it.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll find it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 What is the matter with you? You just made her feel terrible.
 <br>
 I was nervous.
 <br>
 You know I don&#39;t know when to shut up.
 <br>
 What the hell is that? You know, there is gonna be a time when you look back on this, and you&#39;re gonna think it&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna be single &#39;cause Donna will never marry you, but you&#39;re gonna think it&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll get a running start.
 <br>
 And then I&#39;ll jump in and zoom down the hill like the bobsledders do.
 <br>
 And then because this is a canoe on dirt and gravel instead of a bobsled on ice, bad things are gonna happen to you.
 <br>
 This is why I&#39;m a legend Fez.
 <br>
 All right, Kelso, this time you&#39;re wearing a helmet.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde, but I think I&#39;m not gonna put on a helmet with a bunch of worms and stuff crammed inside.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not a prank.
 <br>
 Well, now it&#39;s not &#39;cause I didn&#39;t fall for it.
 <br>
 It finally happened.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve become the boy who cried helmet.
 <br>
 Okay, on three.
 <br>
 Go! Whoo-hoo! holy crap! Did you see me bounce off of that tree? Honey, what is taking so long? I told you to put the dress in the wash for 20 minutes.
 <br>
 Yeah, and now it&#39;s in the dryer.
 <br>
 Oh, no, please tell me you just put it in.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s look on the bright side.
 <br>
 Maybe gray is a more honest color for Donna.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Um, Fez, I know how you how do I say this? Um.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I know you sometimes like to hang out in my closet.
 <br>
 Yes, and do you know what happened to my wedding dress? Uh I have to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 Eric, Donna wants to know what happened to her dress.
 <br>
 Oh, tell her you took it.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll kill me.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll kill me more.
 <br>
 Fine, fine.
 <br>
 But at your wedding, I want my own dance solo.
 <br>
 Yeah, Absolutely.
 <br>
 Anything you want.
 <br>
 With my own spotlight.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 - And a mention in the program.
 <br>
 - Fine! Look, but if you don&#39;t get upstairs, there will be no wedding, which means there will be no dance solo.
 <br>
 Oh, there will be a dance solo.
 <br>
 I took it.
 <br>
 Why? Uh, I forgot to go to the bathroom.
 <br>
 She wants to know why.
 <br>
 Because you&#39;re a pervert.
 <br>
 Hey! No wait.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t even have to lie.
 <br>
 Because I&#39;m a pervert.
 <br>
 Fez, I&#39;m gonna kick your ass! Eric! Oh, my god.
 <br>
 What happened to my dress? Donna, I can explain.
 <br>
 I destroyed it.
 <br>
 You think maybe we&#39;re getting too old for this kind of thing? No, you can&#39;t control the timing of when a canoe is gonna come into your life.
 <br>
 This is a horrible stunt.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna get hurt.
 <br>
 No, no, I&#39;m driving the car.
 <br>
 Kelso will be in the canoe.
 <br>
 Oh, okay, have fun.
 <br>
 All right, Kelso, listen.
 <br>
 You gotta wear the helmet, all right? Yeah, protect that face.
 <br>
 That&#39;s your money.
 <br>
 No, I don&#39;t want to.
 <br>
 Kelso, you&#39;re not pulling out of this driveway until you put on a helmet.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Everyone&#39;s against me.
 <br>
 Let the sparks fly! Whoo! Look at that crazy bastard.
 <br>
 He may not be smart, but he has more fun than all of us combined.
 <br>
 Look, we had a guy like him in the national guard.
 <br>
 Yeah, what happened to him? Invented the wiffle ball.
 <br>
 yeaaaah! Donna, what happened? It&#39;s ruined.
 <br>
 My dress is ruined.
 <br>
 What am I gonna do? It&#39;s okay, honey.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll find you a new dress a better dress.
 <br>
 This is my greatest achievement ever! Dad, I love this dress.
 <br>
 Some random thing off the rack just won&#39;t be the same.
 <br>
 The rope broke! Runaway canoe! Yes! Oh, no, Donna, I think I ripped your dress.
 <br>
 Kitty, I think I&#39;ve got it this time.
 <br>
 For my wedding present for Eric, one of my medals from the war.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 - How about my uniform from the war? - No.
 <br>
 - My gun from the war? - No.
 <br>
 - My boots from the war? - No.
 <br>
 - My canteen from the war? - No.
 <br>
 It can&#39;t be anything you had on or near you when you killed somebody.
 <br>
 How about the ring my dad wore? Oh, that&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 When he killed people in World War I.
 <br>
 Well, now you&#39;re just trying to make me mad.
 <br>
 Yeah, I am.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, I&#39;m so sorry about what happened.
 <br>
 Well, what I don&#39;t get is after the second rip and the first stain, why you didn&#39;t just put the dress away.
 <br>
 Hmm.
 <br>
 Well, at that point, it had become personal.
 <br>
 It was me against the dress, and, well, I was damned if I was gonna let the dress win.
 <br>
 You know, I knew we shouldn&#39;t have broken our no-sex rule.
 <br>
 We completely cursed ourselves.
 <br>
 Okay, enough of this voodoo nonsense.
 <br>
 Bad things happen because I am stupid.
 <br>
 You&#39;re marrying a stupid guy, Donna.
 <br>
 Good luck with me.
 <br>
 Here, sweetie.
 <br>
 For you.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this? Mom&#39;s wedding dress? Yeah.
 <br>
 Swallowed a little pride and called to ask her if it would be okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, but you guys haven&#39;t talked in, like, a year.
 <br>
 It was a little awkward, especially when I said, &#34;it&#39;s Bob.
 <br>
 &#34; And she said, &#34;Bob who?&#34; I love it.
 <br>
 Hey, looks like we kinda saved the day.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t touch me.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Thanks, daddy.
 <br>
 Hey, anything for you, pumpkin.
 <br>
 Plus, I need the room in the attic for my stuffed bobcat.
 <br>
 What was I thinking?
 <br>
