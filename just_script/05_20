<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Donna, you&#39;re so sweet for letting Jackie live here with you while her mom is- - You know.
 <br>
 - Whoring around Mexico? Donna, that is not fair.
 <br>
 I think she left Mexico.
 <br>
 Well, you know, Jackie and I might have fun.
 <br>
 - Sort of like a slumber party.
 <br>
 - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 Yes, late-night girl talk hot oil massages and the furtive whispers of, &#34;We shouldn&#39;t!&#34; And then, &#34;Shh! It&#39;s okay!&#34; - Is that all you&#39;re bringing? - Oh, um, just a couple more small things.
 <br>
 - Out of the way, Jackie.
 <br>
 - Comin&#39; through! Got a buttload! Heavy.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t feel my fingers! - Yup! - Ooh.
 <br>
 Jackie&#39;s panties! Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 If these babies could talk, I bet they could tell some pretty good stories about me! Yeah, I bet they&#39;d have a French accent too.
 <br>
 My girlfriend&#39;s panties, Kelso? Is that really a road you want to go down with me? What&#39;s that, panties? [Chuckling] Oh, no! I can&#39;t tell Hyde that one! Naughty panties! What&#39;s that, fist? It would be my pleasure.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 One general-issue military cot slightly used from my days in the National Guard.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s good to know that the National Guard was gettin&#39; a good night&#39;s sleep while I was in the South Pacific dodgin&#39; bullets and using coral as toilet paper! So- [Sighs] I don&#39;t think there&#39;s gonna be room for everything.
 <br>
 Oh, Donna, sure there will.
 <br>
 I only brought the stuff I absolutely needed.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Where goes the horse? Guys, if I enroll in the police academy in the fall I could be bustin&#39; heads in a year! Freeze, dirtbag! Wow, you did make me freeze.
 <br>
 [Chuckling] But I was a dirtbag long before you came along.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Says here you&#39;re supposed to start getting into shape now.
 <br>
 No, no, that&#39;s not for me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s for the regular guys.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t done a lap in gym class since I had my eighth-grade growth spurt and Miss Brady made me her special assistant.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Guys! Look at this.
 <br>
 I just got another collection letter from the jewelry store about Donna&#39;s engagement ring.
 <br>
 - I gotta get some money, or I&#39;m screwed.
 <br>
 - There&#39;s a job at the hotel.
 <br>
 My boss would have hired ya.
 <br>
 Then he talked to Red.
 <br>
 I gotta do something.
 <br>
 This is a threatening letter.
 <br>
 &#34;Call us immediately&#34;? It&#39;s-It&#39;s in all capital letters.
 <br>
 Look at you.
 <br>
 Another dirtbag dodgin&#39; his responsibilities.
 <br>
 Not on my beat.
 <br>
 Game over, dirtbag! [Chuckles] Man, I wish I had some handcuffs.
 <br>
 Here, use mine! I&#39;m learnin&#39; to do magic! ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] [Sighs] Jackie.
 <br>
 I thought you were gonna put everything away.
 <br>
 I did.
 <br>
 The hardest thing was finding room for my shoes.
 <br>
 But then I realized I could just fit them inside your shoes.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Look, let&#39;s just get some sleep.
 <br>
 [Sighs] - Good night.
 <br>
 - Good night.
 <br>
 [Stereo: Women Singing Pop] Jackie! Turn that off! - [Groans] - ## [Clicks Off] See, Donna, I need music to fall asleep.
 <br>
 See, I wear earplugs so I can just barely hear it but it needs to be loud enough, because I like the vibration in the bed.
 <br>
 So, how am I supposed to get to sleep? Think of something boring.
 <br>
 You know, like school.
 <br>
 Or Eric.
 <br>
 [Clicks On] ## [Ends] Hey.
 <br>
 I sold some of my albums to get some money for Donna&#39;s engagement ring.
 <br>
 Made three bucks.
 <br>
 Which means I am- Let me see, carry the one, um- Oh! Still completely screwed.
 <br>
 They wouldn&#39;t take Anne Murray&#39;s Greatest Hits? Is this whole crazy world turning upside down? Be nice to Anne, okay? She&#39;s a beloved Canadian songstress.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t take her, because- Well, the worse I feel, the more I need her.
 <br>
 Why do you have money? What&#39;d you do, mug a Girl Scout? [Scoffs] No, I&#39;ve been selling my albums.
 <br>
 Oh, I hope you didn&#39;t sell that &#34;Froggy Went A-courtin&#34;&#39; record.
 <br>
 You know, when we were toilet-training Eric I&#39;d say, &#34;Does someone need to go a-courtin&#39;?&#34; And he would just run straight off and make a jobby.
 <br>
 - [Laughing] - [Chuckling] You know, it occurs to me that since I paid the allowance that bought those records in the first place, that money&#39;s mine.
 <br>
 It occurs to me that possession is 9/10ths of the law.
 <br>
 Keep up with the smart mouth, and my foot&#39;ll be 9/10ths of the way up your ass.
 <br>
 You know, Forman, you should write a book: Things My Father Threatened To Put In My Ass.
 <br>
 &#34;Chapter One: His Foot.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;d buy that.
 <br>
 - Ew! - Donna, don&#39;t you knock? Not when it&#39;s my room! Well, we&#39;re in here, so- Yeah, well, I&#39;m in here, so- Hey, if you want to watch, I can get into that.
 <br>
 Have a seat on the horse.
 <br>
 - Hey, how was your weekend, Roy? - Aw, pretty good.
 <br>
 Think I might have met a woman.
 <br>
 - Aw, that&#39;s great, man.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s stayin&#39; at the hotel.
 <br>
 When I took butter to her table, she looked right at me and said &#34;Took you long enough.
 <br>
 &#34; Huh? - [Dinging] - All right! Here I am! Oh, Steven, meet our new kitchen assistant.
 <br>
 You hired Kelso? Do you know how many fires this guy&#39;s started? Three electrical, two chemical, and one that even surprised me.
 <br>
 Well, I wanted to help him out, and he said he needed a job.
 <br>
 Yeah, if I&#39;m gonna be a cop, I gotta quit modelin&#39;, I mean- I can&#39;t have the perps lookin&#39; at pictures of me half-naked.
 <br>
 Oh, and, uh, everywhere I work, I like to feel at home so I brought a little somethin&#39; ofJackie&#39;s.
 <br>
 Okay, uh, I think that&#39;s a health code violation.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m gonna look the other way, which is hard to do, &#39;cause- Look, panties! [Chuckling] [Laughing] Yeah, I burned you with the panties again! Two days, two locations.
 <br>
 That burn is on tour.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Yeah.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] I guess Roy didn&#39;t make things clear, but, um all new hires are on probation.
 <br>
 So at the end of the week, I get to say whether you stay or go.
 <br>
 Yeah, nice try.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] No, I&#39;m serious, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all up to me.
 <br>
 So you might want to try and get on my good side.
 <br>
 [Sniffs] - Oh, uh, excuse me.
 <br>
 - Yes, may I help you? Oh.
 <br>
 Hello, Fez.
 <br>
 Fenton.
 <br>
 - You two know each other? - I don&#39;t want to talk about it.
 <br>
 - There&#39;s nothing to say.
 <br>
 - You can say that again.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t tell me what to do.
 <br>
 - You&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you? - Maybe I would! - Then there&#39;s nothing to say! Yeah.
 <br>
 Um, I have a question about this letter.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna be able to make a ring payment anytime soon so I was wondering if we could work out some kind of deal.
 <br>
 [Clicks Tongue] Fine.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s a deal.
 <br>
 Come up with the money by Friday or bring the ring back to the store.
 <br>
 What? Bring the ring back? No, I can&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 You can and you will.
 <br>
 No later than 5:00.
 <br>
 I have a party at 8:00.
 <br>
 I need the time to dress.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re going to want to do what he says.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been at the other end of Fenton&#39;s stick, and that&#39;s not a place you want to be.
 <br>
 [Singing Along With Country Pop Record] Who am I kidding? After I can&#39;t pay for Donna&#39;s ring, no one&#39;s gonna be in love with me, honey.
 <br>
 Must you mock me, Anne Murray? Kelso, because of your panty shenanigans I&#39;m banning you from the circle.
 <br>
 I hereby ban you! I also hereby eat your burrito.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde? You&#39;re not the boss of me! All right.
 <br>
 Well, you can&#39;t tell me what to do.
 <br>
 Shoot.
 <br>
 Well-Well, at least I&#39;m still my own man.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not! - [Door Slams] - [Sighs] What do you supposeJackie and Donna are doing in the room right now? Combing each other&#39;s hair? Applying moisturizer to their &#34;all-overness&#34;? Oh, to be a fly in that poop.
 <br>
 All I know is I gotta go tell the woman I love that the ring I gave her for all eternity was actually for only six-and-a-half weeks.
 <br>
 Life&#39;s more complicated than one of your simple little ditties, isn&#39;t it, Anne Murray? Anne Murray.
 <br>
 [Scoffs] - What do you know about hard times? - ## [Ends] [Scoffing] Canada? You wanna borrow our shower? Jackie used up all our hot water bathing her dolls.
 <br>
 Normally, I&#39;d rather hose off in the driveway than ask you for a favor but I&#39;m afraid Bob&#39;ll want to act out some car-wash fantasy.
 <br>
 You got me there! [Laughs] Come on, Jo-Jo.
 <br>
 We can save water if we soap up together.
 <br>
 And when they&#39;re done, I&#39;m retiling the whole damn bathroom.
 <br>
 Okay, so you&#39;re absolutely positive that my hairnet has to be pink? It&#39;s gotta match your apron.
 <br>
 You&#39;re pretty.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Jackie, if you&#39;re gonna stay here, we need to set up a few ground rules.
 <br>
 Okay? You can&#39;t just- What happened to our Led Zeppelin poster? Oh! I put up the Captain and Tennille instead.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 No way is my Led Zeppelin becoming the Captain and Tennille.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Led Zeppelin wishes they could be the Captain and Tennille.
 <br>
 What did you say? Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Um, I need to talk to you for a second.
 <br>
 - [Clears Throat] - Um I have been thinking all day- [Sighs] About your eyes.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] What? Yeah, your eyes.
 <br>
 They&#39;re so beautiful and shiny.
 <br>
 You now what else is shiny? This diamond ring, which has to go back to the store because it isn&#39;t paid for.
 <br>
 Because you can put a price tag on a ring, but, you know who can put a price tag on your eyes? [Chuckles] Only God, that&#39;s who.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re taking back my ring? - Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 L- Man, I wish there were another way, but my dad won&#39;t let me have a job, and- I mean, I can&#39;t make the payments.
 <br>
 God, I&#39;m really sorry.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s okay, Eric.
 <br>
 [Sniffles] I mean, it doesn&#39;t change the way we feel about each other.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] As long as we have that, I don&#39;t need a silly ring.
 <br>
 Um, Donna you didn&#39;t give me the ring.
 <br>
 Yeah, l- I thought you&#39;d think I did.
 <br>
 [Laughs] All right.
 <br>
 Donna, I promise.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m gonna make this up to you.
 <br>
 - &#39;Kay.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Um, Donna, you gave me a quarter.
 <br>
 Mmm, fine.
 <br>
 Hello, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 And you.
 <br>
 - Shut your filthy mouth! - [Gasps] Look, here it is.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s the ring back.
 <br>
 - Oh, honey, that&#39;s paid for.
 <br>
 - What? Someone came in and paid through the end of next month.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not supposed to say who, but she sure was a pretty little number.
 <br>
 I guess.
 <br>
 You know what? It was Donna.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe she&#39;d go behind my back like this! I cannot believe that this man would go behind my back and take what was given to me by God himself.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 What happened between you two anyway? I&#39;m too much of a man to say.
 <br>
 But it involved a half-off sale a crowded parking lot, and a pair of pants to make my ass look like an oil painting.
 <br>
 If you mean, &#34;old and cracked,&#34; then I agree! - I&#39;ll see you in hell! - Well, I&#39;ll be wearing your pants! Okay, I&#39;m feeling a little &#34;in the way&#34; here so- I&#39;m ju- I&#39;m- [Clears Throat] Oh, Roy.
 <br>
 Hey, how&#39;s it goin&#39; with that hotel chick that was all over you, asking for butter? [Chuckles] Well, I had this idea to surprise her with flowers? But when I did, she started screamin&#39; and hittin&#39; me.
 <br>
 And I guess the lesson is, don&#39;t hide in someone&#39;s shower.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with chicks, man.
 <br>
 If I came home and some strange girl was in my shower that would be the greatest day of my life! Yeah! - So, w-what are you doin&#39;? - Oh, Hyde&#39;s makin&#39; me do his laundry.
 <br>
 Then after this, I gotta clean out the toilets and hand-test all the mousetraps.
 <br>
 This probation period is killin&#39; me.
 <br>
 Did Hyde tell you there was a probation period? Aw, man! That guy really knows how to enjoy life! Wait.
 <br>
 You mean, Hyde&#39;s just messin&#39; with me? - I don&#39;t have to worry about gettin&#39; fired? - If I didn&#39;t get fired for hidin&#39; in some woman&#39;s shower, I think your job&#39;s secure.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Kelso, be careful, huh? Some of those T-shirts are delicate.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m- I&#39;m sorry, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be extra careful.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything to screw up my probation period! [Laughing] Hey! I wanna play! Ah! Come on, buddy.
 <br>
 Somebody spray me.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 Maybe you could use these to dry off with.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Probation period! [Laughing] Jackie read my diary, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 And she even wrote little comments inside.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Like, &#34;Oh! This could never happen.
 <br>
 &#34; And-And, &#34;Donna, that guy was whistling at me, not you.
 <br>
 &#34; I can&#39;t take it anymore! I&#39;m kicking her out.
 <br>
 But, Donna, the poor girl has nowhere to stay.
 <br>
 She can&#39;t stay here! She can&#39;t stay anywhere near here.
 <br>
 Bob was in our shower again.
 <br>
 This morning, I pulled something out of our drain that I could not believe came off a human body.
 <br>
 Oh! Donna.
 <br>
 There you are.
 <br>
 Okay, look.
 <br>
 We have to talk about your makeup collection.
 <br>
 ChapStick is not lipstick.
 <br>
 Jackie, sit down.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 We need to talk about you and me living together.
 <br>
 - Donna! - Because it&#39;s just- I just came from the jewelry store.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t pay for your own engagement ring! This ring is from me to you, not from me to you, paid for by you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s like cutting off my bal- lerina shoes.
 <br>
 - I didn&#39;t pay for the ring.
 <br>
 - Fenton at the jewelry store said a pretty little number- Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Mom? You&#39;re the pretty little number.
 <br>
 [Laughing] Well, l- I do like hearing that once in a while.
 <br>
 - But i-i-it wasn&#39;t me.
 <br>
 - Well, I don&#39;t know, Dad some men might consider you- - You just can&#39;t stop talkin&#39;, can you? - Eric, I paid for the ring.
 <br>
 - What? - What? Look, Donna, I read in your diary that you think I&#39;m kind of hard to live with, and well, I realized you were right.
 <br>
 And I wanted to show you that I know, and I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - And, well, thank you.
 <br>
 - Huh.
 <br>
 Well, gosh, Jackie, how very sweet, and uncharacteristic of you.
 <br>
 Well, I know how much you love that ring and I wanted to do something nice.
 <br>
 - Wow, thanks.
 <br>
 - [Chuckles] You know, Jackie, some people, if they want to be nice they just actually start being nicer on a day-to-day basis.
 <br>
 Yeah, I figured it&#39;d be easier to write a check.
 <br>
 - Jackie! Jackie! - Hmm? I heard something underneath my bed.
 <br>
 - Fez? - [Imitating Cat] Meow! Fez, the cat&#39;s outside.
 <br>
 [Imitating Dog] Woof, woof? Please, let me stay.
 <br>
 I promise I won&#39;t make a sound.
 <br>
 Well, I do make some sounds, but they&#39;re happy sounds!
 <br>
