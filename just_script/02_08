<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 You know, Donna, Im not surprised youre in my bed, Iknew you couldnt resist me any longer.
 <br>
 No, I couldnt.
 <br>
 I want you.
 <br>
 I need you.
 <br>
 Well, I never turn down a woman in need.
 <br>
 You know, being here, in your bed, on yourSpiderman sheets makes me feel so ready.
 <br>
 So willing.
 <br>
 Then call me able.
 <br>
 A little mood music.
 <br>
 Damn.
 <br>
 Whats wrong? I mean, hey, baby! I cant believe youre in my bed! I cant believe you came through my window! I know.
 <br>
 Oh, well, I was just sitting at home thinking about you and I thought, why dont I crawl up the side of his house and say hello? So, hello! Hello! Thats-did, did anyone see you? Um, just Hyde.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 I heard a noise downstairs and it scared me.
 <br>
 Man, youre ruining what could be the most important night of my life here.
 <br>
 Heh, heh, well duh.
 <br>
 This is so-I cant believe this! Youve never been in my bed before! I know.
 <br>
 Im in your bed! Youre in my bed! Youre in my bed! Youre in my bed.
 <br>
 Ok, uh, uh, because the bed squeaks.
 <br>
 Because the walls are thin.
 <br>
 Because Red has the ears of a wolf.
 <br>
 Uh, reasons my parents might hear us if we do it.
 <br>
 Right! Ok ok, um, uh, gee, mom, it was hot, so we took off our clothes, and then we got cold, so we got under the covers, and things just started bouncing around Uh, things I might say if my folks catch us doing it! Yes! Ok, um, uh, um, Vonda, Ford, the eighth Famous Henrys! Yes! Oh, ok, um, um, because theres a girl in your bed.
 <br>
 Because theres a girl in your bed! Because theres a girl in your bed, damn it! Reasons to go for it! Yes! So, I, uh Oh, so shes gonna be out the whole week? Well, you dont drink and go ice fishing! That is just common sense! No, no, no, its fine, Ill be happy to pick up her shifts.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Uh-huh! Bye.
 <br>
 Oh, geez, Kitty, you work so hard as it is, I dont want you working double shifts! Well, Red, we need the money.
 <br>
 You know its not every week that Charlenes gonna get septicemia from a rusty hook.
 <br>
 We have gotta take advantage of that! Well, I dont like it.
 <br>
 Oh, you know, if Im gonna be working nights, I better put some meals together for you and the boys.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Kitty! Im not helpless.
 <br>
 I think I can get these guys some dinner.
 <br>
 Ok, yeah, um, Im sure youll be great! Fire extinguisher is in the garage.
 <br>
 So moneys a little tight, huh? No, no, Steven.
 <br>
 Everythings fine.
 <br>
 Were great.
 <br>
 Good morning! And I am not just saying that.
 <br>
 Listen, your mothers working double shifts, so, Ill be cooking.
 <br>
 You know the fire extinguishers in the garage, right? Yeah.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Im gonna have cereal.
 <br>
 Oh, youll be having a lot of cereal.
 <br>
 So wheres Donna, man? Donna? Donna? Oh! You mean that girl who spent last night in my bed? Yeah, yeah, thats the one.
 <br>
 She went home this morning.
 <br>
 So? Ah? Ah? Soooo? So lets just say she went home a very happy woman.
 <br>
 All right, man, you finally did it.
 <br>
 You know, it can mean a lot of things.
 <br>
 No, it means one thing.
 <br>
 And you either did it, or you didnt.
 <br>
 Ok, then we didnt.
 <br>
 But, we didplenty ofgood stuff.
 <br>
 New stuff! Plenty of good, new stuff! Ah, man, youre bumming me out.
 <br>
 Cant you at least just lie to me? Uh, ok, we did it.
 <br>
 Liar.
 <br>
 So, do you like photos, man? Yeah, man.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 Ok, you got the job, man.
 <br>
 Just like that? You dont have to interview anybody else? Nobody else showed up, man.
 <br>
 So, what do I do here anyway? Well I dont expect a lot, man.
 <br>
 Pretty much if the hut doesnt burn down, its been a good day.
 <br>
 And even if it burned down, man, its cool, cause Ive got three or four more of these little huts somewhere.
 <br>
 Hey, listen, if you see one of these huts, could you give me a call, man? Or even better, I could take a picture! Heh.
 <br>
 Whoa! A picture of a photo hut! Hey, thatd be like art or something, huh? Hey, listen, man.
 <br>
 I hope you dont mind if I pay you in cash.
 <br>
 I dont like big brother getting into my business, ya dig? Man, keeping the government out of it, Im so with you! No, my big brother, man.
 <br>
 Hes always hitting me up for money.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Cause youre the responsible one? Yeah, its my curse, man.
 <br>
 Hey, listen!  I gotta go do a thing at a, a place.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, I hear that.
 <br>
 So do you want me to lock up when Im done? Lock up! Wow, thats a great idea, man! Hey, youre one of those idea men, arent you, man? Yeah, maybe someday youll be working for me, huh? Really? Oh, thatd be cool, man.
 <br>
 Hey, but can I have Saturday night off? Cool.
 <br>
 So, you know what? What? Oh, I cant tell you.
 <br>
 Oh my god! Now you have to tell me! Even if its not about me, I wanna hear it.
 <br>
 I was really bad last night.
 <br>
 Did you shoplift? I knew it! No! I slept with Eric last night.
 <br>
 Oh my god! Oh my god! Was it great? Yeah! I was asleep! Eeew! No! No, Jackie, we were both asleep.
 <br>
 So nothing happened? Well, you know, some things happened.
 <br>
 We mostly slept.
 <br>
 You mean, you were in his bed, and he didnt whine and beg for like, two hours until you were so sick of hearing his stupid voice that you just gave in so he would shut up? No.
 <br>
 I love him! He just, like, held me all night.
 <br>
 Oh my god! Thats so sweet! Michaels just after me all the time! I mean, I understand, cause Im sexy and all, but still! Like, ok, he always says, Why cuddle when we could do it? Well, was he always like that? No.
 <br>
 No, I guess things kinda changed after we did it.
 <br>
 But in a good way.
 <br>
 I love it when Eric holds me.
 <br>
 Yeah, I love it when Michael buys me stuff.
 <br>
 Well, guys, Im a little ashamed to admit this, butI got a job.
 <br>
 Yeah, Im thinking about getting a job at a chip factory.
 <br>
 I gotta know how they do this! Yeah, Red wont let me get a job.
 <br>
 He says if I dont study hard and get into college, once I turn eighteen hes gonna kill me! And I think hes serious, man.
 <br>
 Hyde, did you ever stop to think, how you working will make me go to the mall alone today? You didnt think, did you? No.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 Hey, guys, check this out, man.
 <br>
 Forman had Donna in his bed last night, and he didnt even do it! Whats up? Youre a bonehead, man! Im not a bonehead! I mean, we did other stuff, and we cuddled! It was great.
 <br>
 Sometimes, when Im alone, I just love to cuddle.
 <br>
 Forman, she climbed up the trellis of your house, through your window, to get into bed with you, and cuddle? Sorry, man.
 <br>
 I never read that letter in Penthouse.
 <br>
 Those stories are true, you know.
 <br>
 Why would you just cuddle with her, when you could do it? I mean, Forman, doing it is it.
 <br>
 Thats why they call it it! IT!! Guys, it was just one night.
 <br>
 There are gonna be lots of other nights! Eric, opportunity does not knock, and then ring the doorbell, and then knock again, and then leave a note that says, sorry, I missed you, and then call you on the phone- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it, Fez.
 <br>
 And we get it.
 <br>
 What my foreign friend here is trying to say, Forman, is that you blew it, man! And you blew it, man! Im losing my patience with you, man.
 <br>
 You gotta get with her! I mean, theres nothing more beautiful than when two people fit together perfectly like well, like two of these potato HOWD THEY DO THIS? Hey.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You wanna eat this? No.
 <br>
 Well, its in there if you change your mind.
 <br>
 You know, I loved being here with you the other night.
 <br>
 Great! Cause I love that you came over.
 <br>
 It didnt, like, bother you that I was sleeping with you in your little single bed? No, it bothered me, but, in a really good way.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Um, soyou wanna come over tonight? Yeah! Cool.
 <br>
 Id love to.
 <br>
 Great! Cause Im like, wide open.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 So Ill see you tonight? Ok.
 <br>
 Geez, you didnt eat that fish, did you? Cause I was just kidding! No.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Stop acting weird.
 <br>
 Hello, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 How are you doing today? Damn! That pots no good.
 <br>
 That pot would not have boiled over had you put some salad oil in the water.
 <br>
 So you know how to boil water.
 <br>
 Dont you, uh, have some place you need to be? Not really.
 <br>
 If I go home too early, my host parents make me read scripture.
 <br>
 Well, why dont you, uhgo sit in the basement.
 <br>
 All right! Well.
 <br>
 What do you know? Haji had it right! Hey, man.
 <br>
 So this is where you work, huh? Yeah, thats what they say.
 <br>
 Hey, wont you get in trouble if the boss shows up? Oh no, is the boss here? Hey, wait, Im the boss! You know, maybe third times the charm.
 <br>
 Maybe this time, itll be really, really super.
 <br>
 Ta-da! Oh my gosh, Red.
 <br>
 Fried chicken, and mashed potatoes, coleslaw, oh, and a little half a ear of corn.
 <br>
 Oh! I forgot the biscuits! Nice, huh? Oh! Its really nice! Whered you hide the bucket, Red? Here.
 <br>
 Have a wet nap.
 <br>
 All right! The Colonel! Oh, um, there you go.
 <br>
 Well now, what is this? Look, I got a job, all right? And I dont wanna hear anything about, were fine, because I know moneys tight around here, and you wont let Forman work, sojust, take the money and drop it! Oh, hes a keeper.
 <br>
 You know, Im gonna take that money, and open him a savings account.
 <br>
 Well, thats nice, Red.
 <br>
 Or blow it all on booze, I still havent make up my mind! Ah, its my good friend, Eric.
 <br>
 So what will it be? Gilligans Island, pin ball, Stratego, you decide.
 <br>
 Well, actually Fez, uh, Donnas coming over tonight.
 <br>
 So Im just here to get my Barry White album.
 <br>
 Otherwise, I would just love Blah, blah, blah, just go.
 <br>
 Oh, baby, I am ready for love.
 <br>
 Why, hello, Ive been expecting you.
 <br>
 Yawn! So, you ready for bed? Sure! Ok.
 <br>
 What, no Spiderman sheets ? Well, I justjust use those on wash day, so Eric, could we like, slow down for a second? Sure! Well, remember the other night, when we just like cuddled all night? I really liked that.
 <br>
 Right! Yeah! But I was thinking, why cuddle when we could do it? Ok, youve been talking to those idiots in the basement again.
 <br>
 No! Yes! Look, Eric, I know its a long drive.
 <br>
 And, and were gonna get there! Were gonna get there, but, I dont know, I just, I wanna see sometrees along the way.
 <br>
 Ok.
 <br>
 - But Ill be driving? - Youll be driving.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 You swear to god? I do! I swear to god! Ok.
 <br>
 Ok, good.
 <br>
 Because I do love you.
 <br>
 But Im not gonna take my pants off! Would you be more comfortable if I put mine back on? Might sleep better.
 <br>
 Will do.
 <br>
 Hey, waddya doin&#39; man ? You, turn that thing off, and get ready for work I&#39;m not working today man, I got an ear-ache Ear-ache my eye, how do you like a butt-ache, now get your little bla bla bla.
