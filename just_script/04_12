<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So, Eric, have you made your Christmas list for Santa yet? Well, um, I was going to, but then I turned 1 0.
 <br>
 - ( Sighs ) - Steven made his.
 <br>
 T-shirts.
 <br>
 Well, I guess I could ask for a cassette player for the Vista Cruiser like I have for the last 80 years.
 <br>
 But I won&#39;t get one, so I might as well just ask for a raincoat.
 <br>
 Oh, so you want a raincoat? Man, remember when you used to come downstairs Christmas morning and you&#39;d see your stocking over the fire all filled with toys? Well, one year, I saw my mom&#39;s panty hose on the radiator and, uh, Uncle &#39;&#39;Strange Man&#39;&#39; sleeping on the floor.
 <br>
 He had a red nose though.
 <br>
 That&#39;s Christmassy.
 <br>
 Yeah, Christmas used to be so cool.
 <br>
 - Now it&#39;s just another day.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 It sounds like somebody needs a little holiday cheer.
 <br>
 I know! ( Laughing ) You could direct the Christmas pageant at the church.
 <br>
 Hey, yeah, that&#39;s the worst idea I&#39;ve ever heard! Eric, you used to love that pageant when you were a little boy.
 <br>
 And you need some Christmas spirit.
 <br>
 And I already signed you up.
 <br>
 Well, it was fun when we were kids.
 <br>
 Then again, so was eating crayons.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 - Good.
 <br>
 Okay, now, Steven- No! No! Oh.
 <br>
 So you won&#39;t be in a show about how there was no room at the inn even though this innkeeper gave you a room? Your guilt has no power over me! I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 Fa la la la la La la la- boned ( Chuckles ) Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Ho-ho-ho.
 <br>
 ! Guys, check this out.
 <br>
 It looks just like when we were kids.
 <br>
 And look, the wise-men gifts: gold, myrrh, and- Hyde, I think this one&#39;s yours.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be my Baggie of frankincense.
 <br>
 Well, if it isn&#39;t Mr.
 <br>
 First-time Director.
 <br>
 I thought I&#39;d direct, but the church board whose average age is nearly dead feels that I don&#39;t speak to the younger generation.
 <br>
 Oh, Pastor Dave, I loved last year&#39;s Silent Night,Jazzy Night.
 <br>
 It was really funny.
 <br>
 It was a drama.
 <br>
 You guys, you guys! Great news.
 <br>
 Rudolph, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, The Little Drummer Boy- They&#39;re all on TV this week! We can watch &#39;em! Yeah! We can wear our p.
 <br>
 j.
 <br>
 &#39;s and eat gumdrops and drink Kool-Aid.
 <br>
 Hooray! ( Laughing ) Yeah! Okay, guys, let&#39;s talk about your parts.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, I want to be the Virgin Mary.
 <br>
 See, she&#39;s pure and holy and rides a unicorn.
 <br>
 No,Jackie, she doesn&#39;t ride a unicorn.
 <br>
 She does now.
 <br>
 A white unicorn with speckles.
 <br>
 Write that down.
 <br>
 Hey, is there anyone in this show who just kind of lies there and does nothing? Um, there&#39;s the baby in the manger.
 <br>
 I call baby in the manger! Uh, Eric, I don&#39;t want to playJoseph as a carpenter.
 <br>
 Oh, how about if I play him as a spaceman? Okay, uh, Kelso, I don&#39;t thinkJesus was the son of a spaceman.
 <br>
 Oh, really? Well, where do you think God lives? It&#39;s true, man.
 <br>
 - ( Christmas Carol ) - What the hell? It&#39;s the Russians! Aw, geez.
 <br>
 - Bob! - ( Continues ) ( Bob ) Hey there, hi there, ho-ho-ho there.
 <br>
 ! Bob, it&#39;s midnight.
 <br>
 Turn that crap off.
 <br>
 - ( Continues ) - What would I do that for? Hey, check out the keister on Mrs.
 <br>
 Claus.
 <br>
 - ( Continues ) - I know what I want for Christmas.
 <br>
 ! Bob, are you drunk? I&#39;m not sober.
 <br>
 ! Eric, I have a little problem with my part.
 <br>
 Um, it turns out you have me playing a wise man.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t there be any wise women? Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take that up with the guy who wrote the Bible.
 <br>
 Let me get back to you.
 <br>
 Okay, Kelso, you are now playing a wise man.
 <br>
 - Or a space wise man.
 <br>
 - Better.
 <br>
 Better.
 <br>
 How come the foreign guy has to play the shepherd? I have never herded sheep in my life.
 <br>
 Well, once, as a favor.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t I be a lifeguard? Or a space lifeguard.
 <br>
 Then I could herd all the ladies into the pool.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Into the pool, ladies!&#39;&#39; Now, that&#39;s a good role.
 <br>
 Okay, uh, everyone? Everybody? Um, all of your ideas are all um, stupid.
 <br>
 Okay, moving on.
 <br>
 Uh, at the end of the play, when Santa comes in the door- - Ooh! How about- - Kelso, I swear to God if you say Space Santa, I&#39;m gonna kick you in the head.
 <br>
 Never mind.
 <br>
 ( Screams ) Red, are you stealing Bob&#39;s Christmas decorations? It&#39;s only stealing if you, uh- if you keep it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m throwing all this crap away.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I&#39;m married to the Grinch.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Mrs.
 <br>
 Grinch.
 <br>
 Well, as long as you&#39;re not Mrs.
 <br>
 Tattletale, we&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Leo, these guys are driving me crazy in there.
 <br>
 Do you know what they think is Christmassy? Unicorns.
 <br>
 Right- No, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Space unicorns.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s redundant.
 <br>
 Do you have any idea what this is gonna look like, man? ( Folk ) Shark! Everybody out of the water! And off with your tops! Make way! Virgin Mother coming through! ( Motorcycle Rewing ) We come bearing gifts of frankincense, myrrh and Led Zeppelin IV.
 <br>
 Now, let me get a look at that cute little baby girl Jesus! ( Speaking Alien Language ) ( Singing Christmas Rock Song ) ( Ends ) I&#39;m just gonna go home.
 <br>
 Holiday Inn&#39;s on TV.
 <br>
 Now, that&#39;s Christmas.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t go home, man.
 <br>
 This pageant&#39;s your chance to spread some Christmas spirit, and that&#39;s contagious, like V.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 I just- I don&#39;t think I have it anymore, Leo.
 <br>
 Ah, don&#39;t be fooled, man.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 comes back.
 <br>
 No, not- Okay.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;ll watch for that.
 <br>
 So.
 <br>
 Dipping into the frankincense, I see.
 <br>
 Well, no more of that.
 <br>
 Okay? We&#39;re gonna do this play the way it was meant to be done.
 <br>
 And no spacemen.
 <br>
 And anyone who doesn&#39;t like that is no Christmas friend of mine.
 <br>
 And we should be a little bit nicer to those of us who want to watch Christmas specials.
 <br>
 I mean, when Rudolph&#39;s nose shone so bright and Santa realized he could guide the sleigh at night- That was a great moment in American history.
 <br>
 Kelso, Rudolph was small, had a girlie voice and I&#39;m pretty sure he was a little light in the hooves if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Of course he was light in the hooves.
 <br>
 He could fly! ( Chuckles ) ( Chuckling ) I would have guessed Prancer.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;ve all ignored me, so I&#39;ll take that as a resounding vote of confidence.
 <br>
 Guys, let&#39;s do this thing! - What on God&#39;s green earth? - But Pastor Dave, I was just- I know what you were doing.
 <br>
 I recognize that smell from the AC/DC concert.
 <br>
 I was handing out leaflets! - No, but I wasn&#39;t- - Eric Forman, you&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 You know what? Fine.
 <br>
 Rudolph had a girlfriend! Her name was Clarice.
 <br>
 She thought he was cute.
 <br>
 Okay, if anyone was gay, it was that-that Hermey.
 <br>
 No straight elf has hair like that.
 <br>
 ( Clicks Tongue ) Well, as you may know by now, I had to let Eric go.
 <br>
 Wait, you fired Eric? Who&#39;s gonna direct the play? I guess that responsibility falls &#39;&#39;unto me.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; And I am willing to be the reluctant hero on this year&#39;s pageant and whip all you ne&#39;er-do-wells into shape.
 <br>
 Okay, kids, that was a good one.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s work on the scene where you untie me.
 <br>
 And action! Give me my stuff back, Red! Don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, Bob.
 <br>
 And no! Oh, Red,just give it back.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t want anybody to have a happy Christmas! Oh, you want happy? Drink another six-pack.
 <br>
 Oh, this is nice.
 <br>
 This is great.
 <br>
 I guess we have a new tradition here: the annual yuletide fight.
 <br>
 God, can&#39;t anybody just act decent for one freakin&#39; day of the year? ( Groans ) Well, out of the mouths of babes, huh? Well, fine.
 <br>
 Bob, your decorations are in the Dumpster behind the liquor store.
 <br>
 Thanks, Red.
 <br>
 If I had mistletoe, I&#39;d kiss you.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, if I had &#39;&#39;mistlefoot,&#39;&#39; it&#39;d be in your ass.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) You know what I would like for Christmas? No more talk about you putting your foot in other people&#39;s rear ends.
 <br>
 Maybe next year, Kitty.
 <br>
 Whoa, dudes.
 <br>
 What&#39;d you do, man? Leo, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just about to light the Dave.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you guys.
 <br>
 You managed to bring a man of God to tears.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not crying! I&#39;m talking about me, man.
 <br>
 You know, you guys can hassle your skinny friend, Eric but when it comes down to a fundamental moral core he&#39;s the only one of you that&#39;s got one.
 <br>
 So, congratulations.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve ruined Christmas.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 Leo&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I mean, this probably isn&#39;t our finest hour.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s pretty damn fine.
 <br>
 Well,Jackie, you know, since everything&#39;s ruined we could- I don&#39;t know- go home and watch Rudolph.
 <br>
 Michael, those shows are for babies.
 <br>
 But I want to watch it! I wanna! Grow up, Michael.
 <br>
 ( Whimpering ) You never let me have any fun! You guys, I feel kind of bad about Eric.
 <br>
 - Yeah, maybe we should go find him.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Or we could stay here and wrap Dave.
 <br>
 - I say, get Eric! - Come on.
 <br>
 Uh, guys? Oh, right.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) There you go.
 <br>
 Oh, honey, you looked so sad.
 <br>
 I am gonna let you open your big Christmas present early.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - Wow, it&#39;s kind of the size of- - ( Chuckling ) And it&#39;s kind of heavy like- - I knew you wanted one.
 <br>
 - I can&#39;t believe that you got me- a rain coat! See, it&#39;s London Fog! Did I fool you? I put rocks in the bottom, so it would seem heavy.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) - That&#39;s clever.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) Okay, now.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna wrap it back up.
 <br>
 You can open it Christmas morning and pretend you&#39;re surprised.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 So, we got that to look forward to.
 <br>
 - ( Laughs ) - ( Chuckling ) Okay! ( Muttering ) Huh? What&#39;s the matter, Kelso? Rudolph, I can&#39;t watch you anymore.
 <br>
 - My friends say I&#39;m too old.
 <br>
 - Ho-Ho-Hold the phone! Too old for Christmas? That&#39;s nonsense.
 <br>
 Yeah, but everyone&#39;s makin&#39; fun of me.
 <br>
 You know, Kelso, people used to laugh and call me names.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;They wouldn&#39;t let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - So, what did you do? - I kicked &#39;em in the face.
 <br>
 - Blitzen bled like a faucet.
 <br>
 - ( Tapping ) Little Drummer Boy, what are you doing here? - Come, they told me.
 <br>
 - No, but what am I supposed to do? All my friends are gonna think that I&#39;m a baby if I keep watching your shows.
 <br>
 Aw, screw those dumb-asses! If they&#39;re too old for Christmas specials, that&#39;s their loss.
 <br>
 Can I go now? I&#39;m very cold.
 <br>
 Kelso, as long as you really, really believe in our magical world nothing in life can ever hurt you.
 <br>
 So, I can watch.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) I can watch! Whoo-hoo! I can watch! I can watch! I can watch! ( Laughing ) - Look at that face.
 <br>
 - What a nice kid.
 <br>
 - So happy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not too late.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t missed them! - Hey, Dave.
 <br>
 - Uh, Michael? - A little help? - Oh.
 <br>
 That wasn&#39;t fun.
 <br>
 One of the lights burned my neck.
 <br>
 You know, Pastor Dave, the only reason we mess with you is &#39;cause we like you.
 <br>
 You do? You do! I&#39;m cool! I&#39;m cool! Oh, well, if it isn&#39;t the dill-holes of Christmas past, present and future.
 <br>
 We came to talk to you about the pageant.
 <br>
 - Dave said he&#39;ll un-fire you.
 <br>
 - &#39;Cause I&#39;m cool! And we&#39;ll do the pageant however you want.
 <br>
 Yeah, I set &#39;em straight, man.
 <br>
 Look, Forman,just come on back, all right? - Yeah, it&#39;ll be fun.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 We can all be together.
 <br>
 I mean, it&#39;s Christmas, you know? ( Singsong Voice ) Plus, we got you a present.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 A cassette deck.
 <br>
 You guys, thanks.
 <br>
 - So, you&#39;ll come back? - Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 Ohh.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown! - ( Electrical Cracking ) - ( Christmas Carol ) ( All Exclaiming ) - Hey, those decorations aren&#39;t half bad.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckling ) (Jackie ) Look, it&#39;s snowing! Yeah, I hooked up the snow machine.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t nobody smoke though.
 <br>
 This stuff might be toxic.
 <br>
 Ohh, a tape player.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t know you wanted one of those! ( Chuckles ) Isn&#39;t it beautiful? Hey, Steven.
 <br>
 Fix that light up there, will ya? - Ah, I dropped my candy! - Oh, no! Oh! Ah, my knee! ( Groans ) How&#39;s that? (&#39;&#39;Hark.
 <br>
 ! The Herald Angels Sing&#39;&#39;) Behold! The virgin has given birth.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t he cute? He&#39;s got my eyes.
 <br>
 And my hair.
 <br>
 Hark, we come bearing gifts! - Gifts from space! - Kelso.
 <br>
 ! No! Earth air! Toxic! Choking! ( Gasps ) God bless us, everyone.
 <br>
