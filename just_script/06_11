<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So, guys, guess what.
 <br>
 I found the perfect place for me and Eric to get married.
 <br>
 Where, Donna? Please tell us.
 <br>
 Okay, well that place up by the lake that overlooks the entire valley Where people go for romance.
 <br>
 You mean mount Hump? People don&#39;t go there for the romance, Donna.
 <br>
 They go there for the humping.
 <br>
 Eric, let&#39;s go up there tomorrow and check it out.
 <br>
 I know the cruiser&#39;s in the shop, but we could take my dad&#39;s car.
 <br>
 Donna, he&#39;s got that &#34;honk if you&#39;re horny&#34; bumper sticker.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I&#39;d scrape it off, but &#34;I brake for boobies&#34; is underneath it.
 <br>
 Why are you guys all in Steven&#39;s room? Well, Hyde was here, so I came in because I&#39;m not comfortable enough with myself to be alone.
 <br>
 Yeah, but it&#39;s all gray, like a prison cell.
 <br>
 Gray is why prisoners are unhappy.
 <br>
 Really? I always thought it was the loss of freedom And the uninvited man love.
 <br>
 Steven, I just think that you would be happier if you saw pretty things.
 <br>
 Like when I look at myself in the mirror, I&#39;m happy.
 <br>
 When I look at you, I&#39;m happy too, but when you talk, eh Hey, Eric, I have to ask you a very important question.
 <br>
 Can I borrow your G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe for a little experiment? No.
 <br>
 I thought you were gonna say &#34;yes.
 <br>
 &#34; And by the way, the experiment was a success.
 <br>
 G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe melts faster than cheese.
 <br>
 Kelso, you can&#39;t just take my things without asking permission.
 <br>
 Come on, we&#39;re friends.
 <br>
 I figure what&#39;s mine is yours and what&#39;s yours is mine.
 <br>
 What&#39;s Donna&#39;s is mine, too.
 <br>
 Kelso! Yeah, Barbie didn&#39;t make it, either.
 <br>
 No one likes to see civilian casualties.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª That&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 My finger&#39;s due back tomorrow, but my hand&#39;s due back next week.
 <br>
 You know, Michael, I was a little worried about starting to date you, but lately, you&#39;ve really impressed me.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s the police motto To serve and impress.
 <br>
 I thought it was &#34;serve and protect.
 <br>
 &#34; They just changed it.
 <br>
 Maybe you could take me to my doctor&#39;s appointment tomorrow.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll hear the baby&#39;s heartbeat.
 <br>
 Seriously? You want me to do baby stuff with you? Yeah, you&#39;ve been really great these last few weeks.
 <br>
 Yes, I have.
 <br>
 And there&#39;s no telling what you&#39;ll do next.
 <br>
 One day you might even read one of these things.
 <br>
 Yeah, let&#39;s just pray to God that day never comes.
 <br>
 Stupid Kelso.
 <br>
 Guess what I packed.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to go with picnic.
 <br>
 You win.
 <br>
 So when do I get my car back? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 We&#39;re scouting places to have the wedding.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t need to scout anywhere but the inside of a church.
 <br>
 What better place to start a happy life than our lady of perpetual sorrow? Well, dad, the thing is we&#39;re not getting married in a church.
 <br>
 But we are thinking about getting married at mount Hump, which is sort of the church of humping.
 <br>
 Well, no church, no car, just like it says in the bible.
 <br>
 Well, the bible doesn&#39;t say anything about taking Kelso&#39;s van.
 <br>
 Donna, we can&#39;t just take it.
 <br>
 Of course we can.
 <br>
 What&#39;s his is yours, remember? Do it for the liquefied face of g.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t think of a more fitting way to honor the real American hero.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª You&#39;re welcome, big guy.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this for? No reason.
 <br>
 I was just thinking about you And how we&#39;ve been through a lot together.
 <br>
 No, we haven&#39;t.
 <br>
 Oh, he gave you shoes.
 <br>
 What do you say, Red? What the hell is wrong with you? Or we say, &#34;thank you very much.
 <br>
 &#34; Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little odd for a man to give another man a pair of shoes? I saw &#39;em.
 <br>
 I thought they&#39;d go nice with your tan pants.
 <br>
 Quit thinking about my pants! My legs and what covers them is my business.
 <br>
 He&#39;s very sensitive about his legs.
 <br>
 You know, he shouldn&#39;t be.
 <br>
 They&#39;re shapely, like a lady dancer.
 <br>
 Maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so sensitive.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, finally.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been waiting all afternoon.
 <br>
 I&#39;m about to burst! Hey, man.
 <br>
 Thinking maybe you should wait out here.
 <br>
 No, no, no, Fez.
 <br>
 You should see this.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a dream come true.
 <br>
 Surprise! Jackie, what the hell happened to my room? I redecorated it.
 <br>
 Now if a stranger comes in here, he&#39;d never know you were poor.
 <br>
 Looks like something for a girl.
 <br>
 I like it.
 <br>
 Or Fez.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t live like this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m getting sick just looking at it.
 <br>
 Yes, yes, Steven, that sick feeling is your orphan soul coming alive.
 <br>
 Jackie, just put it all back, okay? Make it ugly and dirty like I like it.
 <br>
 Well, excuse me for spending all morning putting up twinkle lights that are breathtaking, pillows as soft as marshmallows and scented candles that make you feel like you&#39;re running through a field like Laura freakin&#39; ingalls! Okay, okay.
 <br>
 We came here for a reason.
 <br>
 Now should I start and you watch, or should you start and I watch? Either way, I&#39;ll be done first.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª So I told Hyde he could watch while Jackie and I do it.
 <br>
 And then he beat my ass with a twinkle light.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s my van? Now I parked it right here! Calm down.
 <br>
 You probably just lost it again.
 <br>
 Where was the last place you had it? Right here! Somebody stole my van! (gasps) That&#39;s horrible! I left a brand-new bag of tootsie rolls in there.
 <br>
 Fez! Okay, okay, it was just half a bag.
 <br>
 But if you talk to the insurance company, just tell them it was a whole bag.
 <br>
 I finally got Brooke to trust me, and if I don&#39;t take her to this doctor&#39;s appointment, I&#39;m dead.
 <br>
 What am I gonna do? Don&#39;t beat yourself up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s only tootsie rolls.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m gonna take Red&#39;s car.
 <br>
 I know he&#39;s got a hide-a-key in there somewhere.
 <br>
 Are you brain-damaged? Fez, did you just say, &#34;are you brain-damaged?&#34; and sound exactly like Red? Kelso, you know I only do Johnny Carson and Pepe le Pew.
 <br>
 Get away from my car.
 <br>
 Your car, my car.
 <br>
 Aren&#39;t we all just driving the same car? It&#39;s a car called life.
 <br>
 How about I drive my foot into this thing called your ass? A simple &#34;no&#34; would suffice.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª Shoes are an inappropriate gift to give another man.
 <br>
 Well, what about when you joined the service? Another man issued you your boots.
 <br>
 But then he gave me a gun, so I let it go.
 <br>
 Well, why don&#39;t you just accept the shoes because Bob is your friend? You don&#39;t understand how men work.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t give each other presents.
 <br>
 We pretty much ignore each other until someone scores a touchdown.
 <br>
 You should listen to me.
 <br>
 I know how to be a friend, and you obviously don&#39;t, since you don&#39;t have any.
 <br>
 I have plenty of friends.
 <br>
 Charlie&#39;s a friend.
 <br>
 He saved my life during the war.
 <br>
 And when is the last time you talked to Charlie? We said all we needed to say on the boat back home.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª I don&#39;t believe this.
 <br>
 This is crazy.
 <br>
 (sniffs) not bad.
 <br>
 (barry white) Ã¢ÂÂª feels so good Ã¢ÂÂª Nice.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª lying here next to me Ã¢ÂÂª It&#39;s so soft.
 <br>
 So smooth.
 <br>
 Ahh.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª my hands just won&#39;t keep still Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, yeah! Isn&#39;t this amazing? It is called mount hump because people come here to hump? Or do people come here to hump Because it&#39;s called mount hump? It&#39;s like the chicken or the egg.
 <br>
 Well, I have a really good feeling about this place.
 <br>
 Donna, there are panties in the grass.
 <br>
 Well, fez collects panties.
 <br>
 So we could just set him loose up here Before the ceremony.
 <br>
 So quiet and peaceful.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t hear anything.
 <br>
 Actually, I hear a car.
 <br>
 (crash) Oh, man, some poor sucker Just totally got into an accident.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª (bell dinging) Your chariot has arrived, my lady.
 <br>
 What happened to your van? A little problem with the van.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t find it.
 <br>
 Michael, people lose keys to a van, Not the whole van.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m gonna miss my doctor&#39;s appointment.
 <br>
 Look, brooke, this is not my fault.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my fault for depending on you.
 <br>
 Okay, I can fix this.
 <br>
 Just hop on the handlebars and I&#39;ll pedal you there.
 <br>
 Hello! I&#39;m pregnant! Okay, fine.
 <br>
 You pedal and I&#39;ll ride.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª Oh, look.
 <br>
 Here you are with all your friends.
 <br>
 You claim to have all these friends.
 <br>
 Here are last year&#39;s christmas cards.
 <br>
 Kitty, a card from the jose cuervo collector&#39;s club Doesn&#39;t count.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I can afford to throw this one away Because I have 55 more.
 <br>
 I will keep this because it has a coupon in it.
 <br>
 Anyway, it doesn&#39;t matter Because I&#39;m keeping the shoes.
 <br>
 A good shoe is a good shoe no matter where it comes from.
 <br>
 Oh, it&#39;s like I&#39;m walking on a pile of baby ducks.
 <br>
 Well, hello there, Senor fancy sheets.
 <br>
 I love the way jackie decorated your room.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all glittery, like-- Like an italian person lives there.
 <br>
 You let your girlfriend decorate your room? She also buy you a new dress? Yeah, I guess I have a lot to answer for.
 <br>
 Then again, I never accepted a pair of shoes From another man.
 <br>
 I knew it was a weird gift! Kitty said it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 They&#39;re nice.
 <br>
 Steven, tell him they&#39;re nice.
 <br>
 Nah, can&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 But you know what? Maybe she&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Maybe you should keep the shoes And give bob a present in return, Like a necklace or some sexy lingerie.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª Man, poor kelso&#39;s van.
 <br>
 When it finally landed, It didn&#39;t so much crash as completely separate Into its basic elements and just return to nature.
 <br>
 It was so sad.
 <br>
 There were tootsie rolls everywhere.
 <br>
 Yes, took a nap in my room.
 <br>
 My goose down duvet is like a cocoon.
 <br>
 I laid down a caterpillar and woke up a butterfly.
 <br>
 Maybe you with your room and red with his shoes Should get a room And decorate it with red&#39;s shoes.
 <br>
 Ha! Burn! Man, you just don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like To have a bed that hugs you like you&#39;re a little baby.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like crawling into a mommy kangaroo.
 <br>
 I miss my kangaroo.
 <br>
 Remember when I said that he should decorate his room With red&#39;s shoes? Ha! Burn! (hyde screams) Hyde&#39;s in trouble! She took it all down.
 <br>
 Did you just scream like a girl? No.
 <br>
 (sighs) What happened to my lavender-scented candle? Did you just say, &#34;what happened to my lavender-scented candle?&#34; No.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª Thank you.
 <br>
 Oh, okay, so I made appointments With all the doctors in your address book &#39;cause I don&#39;t know which one was the woo-woo doctor.
 <br>
 You know what? Stay out of my stuff.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take care of things myself &#39;cause you obviously aren&#39;t responsible enough to handle it.
 <br>
 Oh, kelso, you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Um, hey, can I borrow your van For a little experiment? No.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I thought you were gonna say &#34;yes.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, my god.
 <br>
 Is that my steering wheel? It&#39;s the biggest piece I could find.
 <br>
 Listen, kelso, I am so sorry.
 <br>
 I took the van to mount hump, And I forgot to set the parking brake.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just really sorry.
 <br>
 The horn doesn&#39;t honk anymore.
 <br>
 Look, you know, at first, it seemed okay Because you melted my g.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joe.
 <br>
 But I mean, it&#39;s not as bad as destroying a van, so I don&#39;t know why I just said that.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what to say.
 <br>
 Well, I do.
 <br>
 You know, I called michael irresponsible, But he&#39;s not.
 <br>
 You are.
 <br>
 You&#39;re an irresponsible, twitchy little man! Okay, please, just don&#39;t bump me With that thing.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 If he&#39;s irresponsible, That means I&#39;m the good one.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the good one now! Yeah, he&#39;s obviously the dumb one of your group.
 <br>
 Hey, he really is.
 <br>
 Ã¢ÂÂª Red forman, don&#39;t you dare Throw those shoes away.
 <br>
 I just can&#39;t keep &#39;em, kitty.
 <br>
 Every time I wear them, I&#39;ll feel bob touching my feet.
 <br>
 Are you throwing away my shoes? No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 He is not throwing away your shoes.
 <br>
 He is getting rid of that pesky new shoe smell By rubbing old food on them.
 <br>
 I&#39;m throwing them away, bob.
 <br>
 Look, I appreciate the thought.
 <br>
 No, well, that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 I mean Shoes are a weird gift to give another man.
 <br>
 I mean, what&#39;s next? A weekend in cancun? Okay, fine.
 <br>
 I bought the shoes for myself, But they pinched my toes, So I decided to pawn &#39;emff on you as a gift.
 <br>
 You were just trying to screw me over? Well, I can respect that.
 <br>
 Thanks for the shoes, bob.
 <br>
 See, I have a friend.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 This is not the way friends act.
 <br>
 He was gonna throw away your present, bob.
 <br>
 Come on, kitty.
 <br>
 I gave him shoes.
 <br>
 That&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t punch me in the face right then.
 <br>
 I almost did.
 <br>
 (laughing) Ã¢ÂÂª Jackie, what the hell? Why&#39;d you take everything down? You said, &#34;take everything down.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, you didn&#39;t have to.
 <br>
 You said, &#34;you have to.
 <br>
 &#34; I didn&#39;t mean it.
 <br>
 You said, &#34;I mean it.
 <br>
 &#34; Look, just put it all back.
 <br>
 Not until you admit you loved it.
 <br>
 Jackie, who cares who&#39;s right or wrong here? Isn&#39;t the important thing that you make me happy? Who are you talking to? Do you even know me? Fine.
 <br>
 I loved it.
 <br>
 And? The twinkle lights were breathtaking.
 <br>
 And? The scented candles made me feel like laura ingalls.
 <br>
 All right, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 We need to find another place to get married.
 <br>
 I just wrote out, &#34;you are cordial invited to mount hump,&#34; And I died a little inside.
 <br>
 Well, then I guess we should also rule out The scenic banks of nipple creek.
 <br>
 Where is michael? You know, whenever he tells me he has a surprise for me, It makes me a little nervous.
 <br>
 It&#39;s probably just &#39;cause the last time He said that to you, you got pregnant.
 <br>
 Tires squeal) So what do you think? I think barbie&#39;s probably worried sick That her convertible&#39;s missing.
 <br>
 I thought you were getting another van.
 <br>
 Oh, so did I, But then I saw this baby down at the police auction, And I knew it was destined to be mine.
 <br>
 Well, hey, man, can I give you some money? No, it was pretty cheap.
 <br>
 Some guy got stabbed in it.
 <br>
 So nobody else bid on it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s pretty sweet, huh? It&#39;s frickin&#39; awesome.
 <br>
 Is it the car, or are you more handsome? It&#39;s the car.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m more handsome.
 <br>
 Michael, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little impractical? Impractical? More like imperfecticable.
 <br>
 This thing is totally baby-friendly.
 <br>
 Remind me again how it&#39;s baby-friendly.
 <br>
 Cause it&#39;s tiny, just like a baby.
 <br>
 (manly voice) barbie, you are gross, but I still love you.
 <br>
 (high-pitched voice) really? Even though my face is melted off? (manly voice) yes, but your perfect plastic boobs Remain untouched jewels.
 <br>
 (high-pitched voice) oh, can my twin sister watch? (manly voice) why just watch? There&#39;s plenty of joe to go around.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t see you.
 <br>
 <br>
