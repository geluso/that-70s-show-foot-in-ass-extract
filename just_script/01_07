 Wild Man Oh, my God, Michael, they opened up a disco.
 <br>
 - Where at? - In Kenosha.
 <br>
 You can wear your David Bowie butt-huggers.
 <br>
 Michael, that would be super.
 <br>
 Laugh if you want, man, but my butt looks pretty good in those.
 <br>
 Come on, are you guys crazy? I mean, a disco? No way.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It might be kind of fun to go dancing.
 <br>
 - Or we could go.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ve got nothing.
 <br>
 I fold.
 <br>
 Man, if you&#39;re out, go make some popcorn.
 <br>
 Take her with you.
 <br>
 What is disco? Disco is from hell, okay? And not the cool part of hell with all the murderers but the lame-ass part where the really bad accountants live.
 <br>
 Excuse me, what are you doing? - Looking at Kelso&#39;s cards.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s cheating.
 <br>
 Eric, we can&#39;t find the popcorn! Donna, why don&#39;t you take a look at my cards? Then you won&#39;t have to wait for me to leave.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Come on, take a look.
 <br>
 Tell me what I have, you cheater.
 <br>
 - You&#39;ve got nothing.
 <br>
 - Yeah, but I&#39;m gonna bluff.
 <br>
 So, watch out.
 <br>
 - Donna has stuff for Eric.
 <br>
 Yes? - Not stuff.
 <br>
 Thing.
 <br>
 Donna has a thing for Eric.
 <br>
 Why do you have a thing for Eric? He makes me laugh, he doesn&#39;t ask me stupid questions - he&#39;s smart, and you know.
 <br>
 - No, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 It is because Eric is noble, and a woman wants her first lovemaking to be in the arms of a man she can trust.
 <br>
 - Fez.
 <br>
 - Yes? Go make popcorn.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! Dad, I want to talk to you about my curfew on Saturday.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re going to a disco in Kenosha.
 <br>
 - Dancing in Kenosha, that&#39;s quite a drive.
 <br>
 Can I push my curfew to 2:00? Or 1:30? - Or 1:00? - Done.
 <br>
 So, who&#39;s going? - Donna, I&#39;m sure.
 <br>
 They&#39;re practically dating.
 <br>
 - Can I have some gas money? - Dating? Since when? - Mom, we&#39;re not dating.
 <br>
 - Why not? She likes you.
 <br>
 - Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 About that gas money.
 <br>
 Now, she&#39;s interested.
 <br>
 I can tell.
 <br>
 And dancing is the quickest way to a gal&#39;s heart.
 <br>
 Remember, Red when we used to go dancing at the Avalon on Mackinaw island? Mackinaw.
 <br>
 Now, that&#39;s quite a drive.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll bet the mileage is Volare You see what you did? You got your mother started.
 <br>
 Volare Man, I can&#39;t believe you and Jackie are dragging everybody to the disco.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s so sad.
 <br>
 - No, I&#39;m just going to meet Kenosha chicks.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m breaking up with Jackie.
 <br>
 - Get a tall chick.
 <br>
 Because you and Jackie look so silly together.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s all the deposit bottles.
 <br>
 And the aluminum cans.
 <br>
 We gotta have at least $1.
 <br>
 15 worth of gas.
 <br>
 Come on, my dad&#39;s got a ton of empties.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re gonna waste all their money on a stupid disco when they could buy a really big bag Of caramels.
 <br>
 Not going to that disco, huh? No.
 <br>
 Phony people listening to crappy music does not sound like my kind of time.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t dance, can you? - I can dance.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t think so, pal.
 <br>
 I can dance.
 <br>
 Not one step.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Not one step.
 <br>
 Then you got a problem, son &#39;cause women wanna dance.
 <br>
 They always wanna dance.
 <br>
 Always.
 <br>
 Why? Because they can get close and wiggle their bodies around in front of a man in a safe atmosphere.
 <br>
 See, I don&#39;t really wanna wiggle around in public.
 <br>
 Of course not.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a man.
 <br>
 My point is, you&#39;re going to have to learn.
 <br>
 Otherwise, later on in life you&#39;re gonna be wiggling all by yourself.
 <br>
 Now, if you want I can help you out.
 <br>
 Okay, now, that was good.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s try it again.
 <br>
 Okay, now, left, right, left turn, and step.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t keep up with the music, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Now, let&#39;s not get discouraged.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I am just gonna turn this music off.
 <br>
 Now you follow me.
 <br>
 Okay, you can do this.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Left, right, left turn and step.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Look at me, not at your feet.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what now, put your arm around me.
 <br>
 A little bit lower.
 <br>
 Put your hand in the small of my back.
 <br>
 Feel how you can guide me? Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, left You&#39;re leading.
 <br>
 Okay, now, tell me where to move with your hands.
 <br>
 Left, right, left turn, okay, eye contact in the turn.
 <br>
 Okay and dip.
 <br>
 Okay, now, let&#39;s just do it again.
 <br>
 Hello? Anybody home? I&#39;m bringing back your thermos.
 <br>
 Put your hand there.
 <br>
 That&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 You are better than Red.
 <br>
 I am exhausted.
 <br>
 That is sweaty work.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I would really appreciate it if maybe we didn&#39;t tell anybody about what we&#39;re doing here.
 <br>
 Mum is the word.
 <br>
 - Tomorrow after school, okay? - Thanks.
 <br>
 And, Steven, you were good.
 <br>
 Okay, I thought about it, and I&#39;m going to the disco.
 <br>
 Just on the off chance they might mix up a little rock and roll, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, I have something to say.
 <br>
 I went to the mall today and I bought a pair of new shoes.
 <br>
 And they are the coolest kicks in the cave.
 <br>
 So, no more for Kelso.
 <br>
 He&#39;s toasted.
 <br>
 I would like some toast if you are making some.
 <br>
 Or food of any kind would be good.
 <br>
 I am starving.
 <br>
 I read somewhere there are these people in India who fast, man.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And their minds are so advanced they can actually think themselves to death, man.
 <br>
 I hope I&#39;m not doing that right now.
 <br>
 My mind&#39;s always doing things that I don&#39;t even know about.
 <br>
 Man, we always think of so many brilliant things down here but then later, I can&#39;t remember any of them.
 <br>
 I mean, they&#39;re brilliant, man.
 <br>
 Someone go make toast right now.
 <br>
 We should record our conversation, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, then we could play it back and write it down.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s how the writers at National Lampoon do it.
 <br>
 Yeah, I read somewhere that there are these people in France.
 <br>
 What do they do? You see, they&#39;re incredibly French.
 <br>
 See, that&#39;s brilliant, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m getting a tape recorder.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s my toast, you idiots? - Eric? - Yeah, Dad? Listen, I know you need gas money for Saturday night.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re willing to do a few extra chores, I&#39;ll pay you $10.
 <br>
 - Sure.
 <br>
 I can do that.
 <br>
 - Now I need you to sweep the garage clean the leaves out of the gutters, get the dry cleaning and fix that shelf in the pantry.
 <br>
 Now run that back to me.
 <br>
 Okay, fix the shelf, sweep the garage, pick up the leaves Pick up the dry cleaning.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 The gutters? Fix the gutters.
 <br>

 Clean out the gutters, fix the shelf, sweep the leaves.
 <br>
 The garage.
 <br>
 Fix the garage.
 <br>

 <br>

 <br>
 Sweep the garage, pick up the cleaning, clean up the gutters fix the shelf.
 <br>
 Do that, and you got yourself gas money.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t you say something about leaves? - They&#39;re in the gutters.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 Pick them up.
 <br>
 Clean them up.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve gotta make toast.
 <br>
 Ya! Oh, jeez, Midge.
 <br>
 Kitty and that boy are at it again.
 <br>
 - You smell great.
 <br>
 What did you do? - I took a bath.
 <br>
 I was thinking of you the whole time.
 <br>
 You know, I do the same thing in the shower.
 <br>

 One, two - Mom, why don&#39;t I take a picture of you? - No.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;ll be late.
 <br>
 Bye now.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the best.
 <br>
 You go get them, tiger.
 <br>
 Kitty, I need your advice.
 <br>
 - Sure.
 <br>
 What is it? - I have this married friend.
 <br>
 And she&#39;s about to throw everything away because she&#39;s attracted to a much younger man.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s Stella.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 I knew that Stella was open for business.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not Stella.
 <br>
 - Do I know her? - Yes.
 <br>
 Very well.
 <br>
 Midge.
 <br>
 Does Bob know? Yeah.
 <br>
 And he doesn&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 Kitty, I don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 Midge.
 <br>
 Listen.
 <br>
 I think your friend should think about all the people she&#39;s gonna hurt and tell this younger man, whoever he is, I don&#39;t wanna know that it has to stop.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 I just hope my friend takes your advice.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure your friend will.
 <br>
 Younger man? Wonder what that&#39;s like.
 <br>
 Jackie, where&#39;d you go? I had to get something for you to bite on &#39;cause I told everyone you were having a seizure.
 <br>
 - When do they play the disco music? - This is disco music.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 This is samba.
 <br>
 Fez, it&#39;s disco, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s crap.
 <br>
 I think I like this crap.
 <br>
 - Come, Jackie, let&#39;s get down.
 <br>
 - No, I think I&#39;m a little tired.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t resist me, mama.
 <br>
 It&#39;s boogie time.
 <br>
 I think you just lost your date.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s cool &#39;cause Jackie and I are history! She must not weigh that much.
 <br>
 She touching his ass? Listen.
 <br>
 Merengue.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re crazy.
 <br>
 - They are really good.
 <br>
 - Yeah, if you want to dance that way.
 <br>
 - I would love to dance that way.
 <br>
 - You wanna dance? Sure.
 <br>
 You dance.
 <br>
 This is a side of you I&#39;ve never seen.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Actually, you&#39;re my first dance.
 <br>
 I&#39;m your first.
 <br>
 I&#39;m honored.
 <br>
 This is nice.
 <br>
 Donna, man, I feel like I wanna kiss you.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to kiss me back if you don&#39;t want.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not kidding.
 <br>
 Shut up and dance.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re an amazing dancer.
 <br>
 Actually, Jackie, you are the reason I am amazing.
 <br>
 You see, when a man dances, he should display the woman to the room like a beautiful flower.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Michael! All right, pal, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s you and me, right here, right now.
 <br>
 - Why did you have to interrupt us? - Jackie is my girl, Fez.
 <br>
 - But you are breaking up with her.
 <br>
 Where do you even get that stuff? Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be running away now.
 <br>
 Michael! Michael, it&#39;s not his fault.
 <br>
 You just don&#39;t know how to dance with me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know how to dance, so you just take off with some other guy? I know, Michael.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I was wrong.
 <br>
 But all I wanted to be was displayed like a flower.
 <br>
 You know that you are my flower.
 <br>
 That is so beautiful.
 <br>
 Put me down.
 <br>
 Michael.
 <br>
 Okay, I am passing out now.
 <br>
 Okay, Bob, what is it? Just curious.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s the word on that Hyde kid? - Steven? He&#39;s a little rebellious.
 <br>
 He just needs some direction.
 <br>
 Apparently, he&#39;s getting it, Red.
 <br>
 I kind of walked into your living room and he and Kitty were in some sort of provocative embrace.
 <br>
 I think he was putting the moves on your wife.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;ve got to kill him.
 <br>
 Get your deer rifle, Bob.
 <br>
 Hold on, Red.
 <br>
 I could&#39;ve been mistaken.
 <br>
 You know what you saw.
 <br>
 Get the damn gun.
 <br>
 Maybe she was choking, you know, on some food or something.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t take that chance.
 <br>
 What choice do I have as a man? Come on, Red.
 <br>
 They could&#39;ve been dancing.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure she was teaching him dancing &#39;cause they were all going to that disco.
 <br>
 - Dancing, huh? - Yeah.
 <br>
 Jeez, Bob that would be downright logical.
 <br>
 Good thing I didn&#39;t shoot him.
 <br>
 Hyde, you were right about disco music.
 <br>
 It is evil.
 <br>
 Its pulsing rhythm made me do a bad thing.
 <br>
 Yeah, me, too.
 <br>
 Kelso is my friend.
 <br>
 I cannot take his woman.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a good guy, Fez.
 <br>
 Actually, I could take his woman, but I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 Come on, I&#39;ll walk you home.
 <br>
 See you guys.
 <br>
 - See you.
 <br>
 - Good night.
 <br>
 - Hyde dancing.
 <br>
 What a surprise.
 <br>
 - Yeah, who knew? Yeah.
 <br>
 You looked like you were having a good time.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know, disco fever.
 <br>
 You catch it.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m better now.
 <br>
 What a weird night.
 <br>
 Did you see Kelso&#39;s shoes? Yeah.
 <br>
 Remember when he saw that girl wearing the same shoes? Actually, that was pretty sad.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 So - Do you recall that night we crossed the Rio Grande? What? I can see it in your eyes.
 <br>
 - What are you talking about? - How proud you were to fight For freedom in this land Shut up.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t.
 <br>
 There was something in the air that night The stars were bright Fernando I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I hate dance music.
 <br>
 Why did you go? I like you.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re in like with me? Donna, I&#39;m in I can&#39;t dance.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll learn.
 <br>
 There was something in the air that night The stars were bright I really want to kiss you again.
 <br>
 Fernando Shut up and dance.
 <br>
 They were shining there for you and me And liberty, Fernando Though I never thought that we could lose There&#39;s no regret If I could do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando If I had to do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando I&#39;m saying, the earth is a farm.
 <br>
 That&#39;s brilliant.
 <br>
 A farm.
 <br>
 A farm put here by aliens, man.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re the cattle.
 <br>
 We&#39;re cattle.
 <br>
 And the government knows it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s out there, man.
 <br>
 What is? The truth.
 <br>
 What are you saying? Out there is the truth.
 <br>
 The truth is out there, man.
 <br>
 That&#39;s seriously brilliant.
 <br>
 See, you are all stupid.
