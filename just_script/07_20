<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 I&#39;m so glad I graduated high school.
 <br>
 You know, it is such a relief to finally know everything.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I graduated a year ago.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, like, I feel like I&#39;ve done nothing.
 <br>
 Man, time really flies when you take two naps a day.
 <br>
 Well, I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;ve done nothing.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;ve wow, you really sat on your ass.
 <br>
 Yep, forman, we&#39;ve all passed you by.
 <br>
 I&#39;m running a record store.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s a deejay.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s a cop.
 <br>
 Even fez has a job now.
 <br>
 What is it again, man, uh, shower girl ? Makeup lady ? Shampoo boy ! Eh, I was close.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 This mean I&#39;m the loser of the group now ? You are the one that&#39;s still living with your mommy.
 <br>
 Man, you&#39;re still living with your mommy.
 <br>
 Not for long.
 <br>
 Me and Fez are looking for apartments.
 <br>
 Then the only time I&#39;ll see my mom is when she&#39;s doing my laundry, cooking my meals, taking me to the dentist.
 <br>
 Well, eric, I feel kind of bad.
 <br>
 You wouldn&#39;t even be thinking about this kind of stuff if you weren&#39;t caught in the blinding light of my bright future.
 <br>
 You know, the scary thing is, if one year went by this fast, imagine where eric is gonna be in ten years.
 <br>
 Thanks for going with me to the &#34;star trek&#34; convention, &#34;uhura.
 <br>
 &#34; You can call me donna now.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good, fez, but I think it&#39;s gonna be more like this thanks for going with me to the &#34;star wars&#34; convention, &#34;leia.
 <br>
 &#34; You can call me donna now.
 <br>
 No, man.
 <br>
 You&#39;re both wrong.
 <br>
 Actually, it&#39;s gonna go like this thanks for going with me to the &#34;star wars&#34; convention, &#34;leia.
 <br>
 &#34; You can call me mom now.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Eric, they&#39;re joking around.
 <br>
 It&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 No, donna, it&#39;s not funny.
 <br>
 In fact it&#39;s completely possible ! That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 20 &#34;Gimme Shelter&#34; Every one of my friends has a career path except for me.
 <br>
 Even kelso.
 <br>
 Kelso the kid who thinks that N.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 Is japanese for &#34;neato.
 <br>
 &#34; You know, it&#39;s just not fair.
 <br>
 I mean, you sleep late, and you watch tv all day the job offers should be rolling in.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you look into that chiropractic school I suggested ? They&#39;re having an enrollment seminar.
 <br>
 You know, a chiropractor is a very prestigious job, especially if you move someplace where they don&#39;t have real doctors.
 <br>
 Well, I guess chiropractor is as good as anything I&#39;ve come up with.
 <br>
 I have wasted an entire year doing absolutely nothing.
 <br>
 Hey, how about a job stating the obvious, &#39;cause you&#39;re getting really good at that.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re gonna be a chiropractor, huh ? All right, every chick patient that you have, you have to tell her the problem is her tailbone, that way you get to grab around on her butt.
 <br>
 Kelso, I&#39;m doing this&#39; cause I want to help people.
 <br>
 A handful of ass is just a perk.
 <br>
 Okay, so I just want to remind everybody about my graduation dinner party tomorrow night.
 <br>
 Be there by 6:00 for the champagne toast.
 <br>
 Free champagne ? I&#39;m in ! Free toast ? I am in, too.
 <br>
 Jackie, a dinner party ? Can&#39;t we do something fun like drive up to the border and throw stuff at canadians ? I mean, they never fight back, &#39;cause they&#39;re canadian.
 <br>
 Steven, this dinner party is an important event to mark my entrance into womanhood.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t that happen three years ago in the backseat of kelso&#39;s car ? I love talking about this in front of hyde.
 <br>
 Yeah, me too, &#39;cause that way, I can do this.
 <br>
 Too hard ! Michael, I circled some apartment listings for you and fez.
 <br>
 I found a great apartment for janet meyers after her divorce.
 <br>
 It has a murphy bed for when her kids come to visit.
 <br>
 They never do.
 <br>
 She&#39;s in A.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 Look at all these places for rent.
 <br>
 Man, I hope we can find one that&#39;s got everything my baby needs.
 <br>
 Oh, kelso, you&#39;re always putting me first.
 <br>
 Not you, moron ! Betsy.
 <br>
 My daughter.
 <br>
 It&#39;s amazing how one tiny person has changed my life so much.
 <br>
 You changed mine, too.
 <br>
 Dr.
 <br>
 Don loves being a chiropractor, and you know why ? Because the cosmos has ordained dr.
 <br>
 Don to make people feel good.
 <br>
 Do you get the feeling that dr.
 <br>
 Don writes himself a few too many prescriptions ? No, I think he&#39;s cool, and I love the way he calls himself dr.
 <br>
 Don.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s impressed.
 <br>
 Within these hands lies an unexplainable magic that melts away the troubles of the world.
 <br>
 And dr.
 <br>
 Don will prove it to you by demonstrating on this attractive blonde in the front row.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m only here to make sure my boyfriend doesn&#39;t sneak out to play &#34;space invaders.
 <br>
 &#34; Step on up here, little lady.
 <br>
 Donna, come on.
 <br>
 I need to make a good impression.
 <br>
 Look, one little medical experiment isn&#39;t gonna kill you.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Here we go, right on up here.
 <br>
 And now just relax.
 <br>
 Dr.
 <br>
 Don has been known to cause patients serious joy.
 <br>
 wow.
 <br>
 That felt great.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 I think your tailbone&#39;s out of whack.
 <br>
 All right, show&#39;s over.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Man, we gotta have this place.
 <br>
 It&#39;s perfect for the baby.
 <br>
 It already smells a little bit like throw up.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you found us a great apartment.
 <br>
 I could just kiss you.
 <br>
 Can I kiss you ? Bob, what are you doing here ? you&#39;re selling your house because you&#39;re broke.
 <br>
 I knew something was wrong when I didn&#39;t see you wearing fur this winter.
 <br>
 No, I come to open houses to meet women.
 <br>
 If a lady&#39;s looking for her own place, she&#39;s either single or running away from a bad relationship.
 <br>
 Either way, I win.
 <br>
 Is everything all right over oh.
 <br>
 It&#39;s you.
 <br>
 Fenton.
 <br>
 I&#39;d shake your hand, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d catch some kind of third world herpe.
 <br>
 That&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t let you touch me with a 10-foot pole.
 <br>
 I wouldn&#39;t touch you with a 20-foot pole.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t even have a 20-foot pole ! Maybe I&#39;ll go buy one just so I can&#39;t touch you with it ! Fez, who is this guy ? This is Fenton.
 <br>
 We are having a feud.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Filling out an application, hmm ? Yes.
 <br>
 We we got here first, so don&#39;t even think about applying.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have to.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the landlord.
 <br>
 The lord of the land.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna lord it over you while your butts land outside.
 <br>
 mmm, that was clever.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah ? Well, I was gonna give you this $5 to get the apartment, but now you can forget it.
 <br>
 That was clever.
 <br>
 Too slow, old man.
 <br>
 Fez, if you&#39;re not polite, he&#39;s gonna figure out you&#39;re living here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re living here ? Oh, great.
 <br>
 You blew it, fez.
 <br>
 Red, he has nowhere else to go.
 <br>
 Well, know this, pelé you gotta sleep sometime.
 <br>
 And during the war, when they were sleepin&#39;, that&#39;s when I got &#39;em.
 <br>
 That wasn&#39;t too bad.
 <br>
 He called you &#34;pelé.
 <br>
 &#34; He is a terrific soccer player.
 <br>
 Oh, everything is set for the party tonight.
 <br>
 Oh, and, fez, I need you to get there a little early so you can park everyone&#39;s cars.
 <br>
 Sorry, jackie, I can&#39;t make it.
 <br>
 What ? Yeah, kelso and I have to go find an apartment tonight, or red is going to kill me in my sleep.
 <br>
 Yeah, and I can&#39;t let fez go alone.
 <br>
 Why not ? &#39;Cause then I&#39;ll have to go to your party, which I don&#39;t want to do.
 <br>
 No, no, no, kelso, you have to go.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re not there and fez is not there, it&#39;s gonna be pretty damn obvious that I&#39;m not there.
 <br>
 Okay, steven, I understand you don&#39;t like dinner parties.
 <br>
 But just let me make my case.
 <br>
 Ohh ! You&#39;re going ! You know, the more I read this chiropractor booklet, the more I&#39;m starting to see that this might be the perfect job for me.
 <br>
 Like, it says right here, you need soft hands.
 <br>
 How many times have you said you didn&#39;t even know I was touching you ? Here.
 <br>
 Let me get a crack at that neck.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 Shouldn&#39;t we wait until you&#39;re, like, a little more experienced ? Experienced ? Uh, donna, I&#39;m on page 12.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s do this.
 <br>
 ow ! Uh-oh.
 <br>
 That did not sound good.
 <br>
 Eric, I can&#39;t move my neck.
 <br>
 Fix it.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure the booklet says something about oh, here it is.
 <br>
 Um, okay, I&#39;m gonna need you to sign a release of liability.
 <br>
 Poor donna.
 <br>
 I think I hurt her pretty bad.
 <br>
 Her neck&#39;s stuck, just tilted over like this.
 <br>
 Yeah, but on the upside, it looks like she&#39;s really interested in everything I have to say.
 <br>
 So she&#39;s got a bad neck.
 <br>
 Quit whining.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve gone out with girls that don&#39;t even have necks.
 <br>
 &#34;hi, fez.
 <br>
 &#34; One time this girl whipped her head around to look at me, &#39;cause I&#39;m hot, and her neck just snapped.
 <br>
 And then she collapsed into the jukebox.
 <br>
 Kelso, that was the fonz.
 <br>
 Well, where do you think they got it from ? Forman, forget being a chiropractor, man.
 <br>
 The way I see it, you&#39;re diligent, tidy and detail-oriented.
 <br>
 So I think you should become a professional butt wiper.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, man, this is serious.
 <br>
 Eric, you gotta start off slow.
 <br>
 First you should be an amateur butt wiper.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong with you two ? So rude.
 <br>
 Eric, I think you should move to paris.
 <br>
 That way you can become a butt wipiér.
 <br>
 how&#39;d the apartment search go ? Not so good.
 <br>
 They can&#39;t find anything they like.
 <br>
 Well, how can you be picky ? You lived in a jungle.
 <br>
 Any place without a gorilla charging at you should be paradise.
 <br>
 Red, I don&#39;t think he lived with gorillas.
 <br>
 Did you ? Where the blazes are you from ? Apparently, gorilla land.
 <br>
 We found one place yesterday that was perfect, but we can&#39;t get it &#39;cause fez and the landlord are having a feud.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re not spending another night under my roof.
 <br>
 So come on, we&#39;re gonna go have a chat with this landlord.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this guy got against you anyway ? Who knows ? That&#39;s like asking you why you hate commies.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t know why.
 <br>
 You just do.
 <br>
 I know exactly why I hate commies.
 <br>
 They wouldn&#39;t stop shooting at me.
 <br>
 Okay, then something else you hate.
 <br>
 Oh, you should have said the vienna boys choir.
 <br>
 I just want to punch them in the mouth.
 <br>
 How you doing, my little buttercup ? Great.
 <br>
 &#34;The brady bunch&#34; is so much funnier sideways.
 <br>
 Okay, so at my party tonight, I want everyone to give heartfelt speeches about me, okay ? So here they are.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I can make it to your party.
 <br>
 Wait, but, donna, you have to.
 <br>
 I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m out, too.
 <br>
 I gotta tend to my crooked little flower here.
 <br>
 You know, eric, calling me cute little nicknames doesn&#39;t make up for what you did.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Hey, whatever you say, my little crazy straw.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe everyone bailed out on me.
 <br>
 You know, tonight was really important to me, and it&#39;s like no one even cares.
 <br>
 Jackie, you look like you really need to talk this through, huh ? I&#39;ll go get Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Are you Fenton ? I&#39;m here to talk to you about the apartment.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re in luck.
 <br>
 It&#39;s still available.
 <br>
 And F.
 <br>
 Y.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 , so am I.
 <br>
 Look, I have a wife.
 <br>
 Well, I have a football, but I never use it.
 <br>
 Red, I know you said wait in the car, but fez keeps playing his crazy bongo music.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called jazz, you philistine.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 You&#39;re with them.
 <br>
 Deal&#39;s off.
 <br>
 I have to get to yoga.
 <br>
 Hey, can&#39;t we talk about this ? - No.
 <br>
 - See, I told you he was going to be just shut it, or I&#39;ll shut it for you.
 <br>
 Well, you just don&#39;t take crap from anyone, do you, Mr.
 <br>
 Man ? I knew this was gonna be a waste of time.
 <br>
 Come on, fez.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll go figure out some other place to live with the baby.
 <br>
 Baby ? No one mentioned they had a baby.
 <br>
 Thatthat&#39;s so progressive.
 <br>
 Progressive ? Well, how can I not give the apartment to two men raising a child together ? Oh.
 <br>
 Yeah, progressive.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s what they are.
 <br>
 They&#39;re as progressive as hell.
 <br>
 Why, they&#39;re like newlyweds.
 <br>
 Mmm.
 <br>
 I wish I knew what that was like.
 <br>
 Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
 <br>
 well, red convinced fenton to give us the apartment.
 <br>
 Yeah, and red seemed so happy.
 <br>
 All the way home, he just kept looking at us and laughing.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure that red told fenton that we knew a lot of chicks.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause fenton kept checking me out, like he could tell that I knew a lot of chicks.
 <br>
 Eric, I can&#39;t believe that you crippled my angel, my pride and joy.
 <br>
 It kills me seeing her like this.
 <br>
 Then why are you bringing her over here ? Oh, I got a date.
 <br>
 I met a lady at the open house.
 <br>
 She&#39;s got crow&#39;s feet, but she works in a sandwich shop, so I bent the rules.
 <br>
 Look, donna, I&#39;m so sorry about what happened.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and I don&#39;t think I ever really wanted to be a chiropractor.
 <br>
 I was just, you know, grasping at straws.
 <br>
 I&#39;d nod in agreement, but, you know, I&#39;m paralyzed.
 <br>
 Eric, you know what I&#39;m realizing about you ? You&#39;re not good at anything.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not true, kelso.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t forget butt wiping.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what ? You guys suck.
 <br>
 Whenever you&#39;re in trouble, I don&#39;t burn you.
 <br>
 I mean, usually &#39;cause it&#39;s hard for me to think of things right on the spot, but also &#39;cause, you know, I try to help.
 <br>
 That&#39;s actually true.
 <br>
 I mean, Fez, remember when you wanted to learn how to kiss, and eric taught you by sticking m&amp;m&#39;s to the mirror ? That never happened.
 <br>
 I know how to kiss.
 <br>
 Oh, shut it, donna.
 <br>
 Yeah, and, kelso, how about that time I stayed up with you all night to study for that math final.
 <br>
 I mean, sure, nothing stuck, but, you know, I blame nature for that.
 <br>
 Yep, some people you just can&#39;t reach.
 <br>
 You know, forman, if you can teach fez how to kiss and kelso how to do math, you can probably teach anybody anything.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just become a teacher ? That actually makes a lot of sense.
 <br>
 I mean, you have all this knowledge about stuff you have no ability to do.
 <br>
 A teacher ? Well, I do like helping people.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;d love to help kids.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Like, &#34;Mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 &#34; That just feels really great.
 <br>
 Yeah, a teacher.
 <br>
 That just feels so right.
 <br>
 There it is.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;s gonna be a teacher.
 <br>
 This calls for a toast.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 To forman.
 <br>
 - To forman.
 <br>
 - To forman.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on ? You guys are all too busy to come to my party, and here you are having a party.
 <br>
 For you.
 <br>
 To jackie.
 <br>
 - To jackie.
 <br>
 - To jackie.
 <br>
 Okay, I don&#39;t believe you.
 <br>
 But as long as I&#39;m center of attention, I&#39;ll take it.
 <br>
 Jackie, grab a beer.
 <br>
 This is a great day.
 <br>
 You graduated.
 <br>
 They found an apartment.
 <br>
 And guess what ? I&#39;m gonna be a teacher.
 <br>
 Eric, you know what you should teach ? Butt wiping.
 <br>
 Fez, that was really inappropriate.
 <br>
 Eric, you should teach history.
 <br>
 The history of butt wiping.
 <br>
 how&#39;s your neck, honey ? Oh, it still hurts.
 <br>
 Come over here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a nurse.
 <br>
 I know what to do.
 <br>
 Take two of these.
 <br>
 Are you sure this is for neck pain ? Neck pain, headaches, bad days they take the edge off of everything.
 <br>
