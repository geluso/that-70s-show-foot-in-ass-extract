 Will this day ever end? Yesterday did.
 <br>
 But today&#39;s Friday.
 <br>
 So, no.
 <br>
 God, it&#39;s Destroy and Giveback.
 <br>
 - Yeah, why do they call them that? - You&#39;re about to find out.
 <br>
 Hey, Foreplay.
 <br>
 I believe this is yours.
 <br>
 - You broke his pencil.
 <br>
 That was great! - And you gave it back.
 <br>
 All right, enough horseplay.
 <br>
 Pipe down.
 <br>
 I said, pipe down! Now, I&#39;ve got an announcement before study hall.
 <br>
 Whoever burned their initials in the football field I hope you&#39;re happy with yourself, punk.
 <br>
 There will be no football practice today until we&#39;ve reseeded.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ve watched that team, I&#39;m not impressed, boy.
 <br>
 Let me tell you, they need all the practice they can get.
 <br>
 On a happier note Eric? Donna? Do you need something to do? Actually, we need to be excused.
 <br>
 Donna and I are taking pictures for the yearbook.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 If you say so, Eric.
 <br>
 You wouldn&#39;t lie.
 <br>
 Well, I might.
 <br>
 This is great.
 <br>
 Eric Forman skips class.
 <br>
 Yeah, danger is my middle name.
 <br>
 Why are we moving? Mommy.
 <br>
 What are you guys doing in here? What are you guys doing in here? I cut class.
 <br>
 What, was there like a fire drill or something? No, look, I do bad things.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;ve ditched class before.
 <br>
 Is Opie getting angry? What did I tell you about calling me Opie? Opie, look out for that keg in the middle of the road! Wow! It is a keg.
 <br>
 Of beer.
 <br>
 It must be a sign.
 <br>
 Of beer.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it, I&#39;m cutting class every day! Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! How did you find it? We were driving down the road, man, and there she was.
 <br>
 It was a beer in the headlights.
 <br>
 That is my first American joke.
 <br>
 How often do you find a mysterious keg of free beer? Only once in a while.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, Forman.
 <br>
 Man, you are absolutely right.
 <br>
 - When God gives you a keg, you&#39;ve gotta - Kill a virgin.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Throw a party.
 <br>
 Whoa! Go for it, Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah, we&#39;ll throw a party.
 <br>
 Gonna charge $2 a head.
 <br>
 $2 a head.
 <br>
 A keg is equivalent to seven cases, that&#39;s 168 beers.
 <br>
 If we each drink three beers a piece - No way, sophomores gonna drink one.
 <br>
 - True.
 <br>
 Yeah, and the freshmen will only drink a half.
 <br>
 So that averages out to 1.
 <br>
 5 beers per person which means we can invite 112 people.
 <br>
 That&#39;s $224.
 <br>
 Cash.
 <br>
 Which is decent.
 <br>
 Okay, grab some ice out of the deep freeze, I&#39;ll grab the tub.
 <br>
 That is one sweet mama.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, gang.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t mind me.
 <br>
 Just came down to do an emergency presoak on my nurses&#39; uniform.
 <br>
 You remember Mr.
 <br>
 Wilbur, the fireman? He came in today with a sebaceous cyst which is a pocket of fluid that&#39;s kind of like a pusy bath oil bead under your skin.
 <br>
 And you think it&#39;s solid, but if you take an instrument and you pierce the core and then you apply pressure with your thumb Hi, snicklefritz, what are you doing with the tub? The tub.
 <br>
 We were just working on a class project.
 <br>
 We&#39;re making a volcano snicklefritz.
 <br>
 Out of ice? I think it might melt.
 <br>
 You heard her let&#39;s move it, gang.
 <br>
 Okay, have fun.
 <br>
 - Guys, we&#39;ve got to get the keg out of here.
 <br>
 - Where are we having the party? Beats me.
 <br>
 If you guys need me I&#39;ll be with Jackie over at our secret make-out place.
 <br>
 - Secret make-out place.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s this vacant house over on Sherman.
 <br>
 I mean, this place is great.
 <br>
 It&#39;s totally private.
 <br>
 I mean, you can get away with about anything there.
 <br>
 So, if you guys find a place for that keg, let me know.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got an idea! That&#39;s a Sylvania, isn&#39;t it, Red? You didn&#39;t buy that in my store, did you? No, Bob, I, got a good deal on it.
 <br>
 You got me.
 <br>
 You got me, Red.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, I am just so excited.
 <br>
 Rich Man, Poor Man.
 <br>
 I missed the first episode.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s the irony of the show, Kitty, the rich, safe guy is boring.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the poor, rugged one, played by the very talented Nick Nolte who is so exciting.
 <br>
 Super.
 <br>
 Now, who would like a drink? Let&#39;s do daiquiris.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if we have enough ice.
 <br>
 Eric took a whole tub full.
 <br>
 He took a tub of ice? The kids are making a volcano.
 <br>
 Right, that&#39;s why Donna left with all the plastic cups.
 <br>
 - Plastic cups? - Sure, plastic volcano cups.
 <br>
 If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say they were having a kegger.
 <br>
 Oh, jeez! Let&#39;s go, Bob.
 <br>
 Rich Man, Poor Man, I love it.
 <br>
 I just hope I don&#39;t get too emotional.
 <br>
 So do I.
 <br>
 Those kids could be anywhere.
 <br>
 Needle, meet haystack.
 <br>
 Look, they left the house in a wood-paneled ocean liner.
 <br>
 We should be able to find them.
 <br>
 Yep, it&#39;s a real asphalt jungle out here.
 <br>
 The sun goes down, the rats come out.
 <br>
 I lost my mailbox last year.
 <br>
 Yeah, you know what it is? The evil spilling over from Sheboygan.
 <br>
 How many stories do you suppose there are in this naked burg? Eight, Bob.
 <br>
 There are eight.
 <br>
 Michael, this is our secret make-out place.
 <br>
 I did not swipe the key from my mother&#39;s real estate office so that you could have a party.
 <br>
 I know it&#39;s like a bonus.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m doing it for you, baby.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Empty pool, empty house, full keg.
 <br>
 You sure know how to show a girl a good time.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t color outside the lines often but when I do, jump back, Loretta.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care when you ate, Fez, get in the pool now.
 <br>
 If I get a cramp, it will be on your head.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Hurry up and drink your keg.
 <br>
 Hurry up and drink a keg? Jackie, will you just mellow out? I mean, this rules.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve got a keg, and soon everybody&#39;s gonna be here.
 <br>
 - Everybody? - Everybody who matters.
 <br>
 And for the first time, Jackie, that includes you.
 <br>
 No, get away from me! You heard her, let&#39;s drink beer.
 <br>
 - Me first.
 <br>
 - No way, I spotted it.
 <br>
 No, I saw it, too, I just didn&#39;t say anything.
 <br>
 You saw a keg and you didn&#39;t say anything? Back of the line.
 <br>
 All right, how do you get the beer out? - Through the tap.
 <br>
 - What tap? No! Okay, we really need a tap here.
 <br>
 I got my Swiss army knife.
 <br>
 Great, we can whittle the beer out.
 <br>
 All right, look, they sell taps at the liquor store.
 <br>
 Yeah, and who&#39;s got the money to buy it? Why would I bring money to our secret make-out place, Michael? Okay, I&#39;ve got my gas money.
 <br>
 No, Eric, we&#39;re not going to take your gas money.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t matter.
 <br>
 By the end of the night, we&#39;ll have made over $200.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Michael, how are we gonna make $200? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Who&#39;s buying the tap? You buy, I&#39;ll fly.
 <br>
 No, Michael, you are Michael, come back here! Michael, I&#39;m talking to you.
 <br>
 Michael! Welcome to the pool.
 <br>
 I am your host, Fez.
 <br>
 $2, please.
 <br>
 What is going on? I didn&#39;t want to tell you before but we&#39;ve taken it upon ourselves to help your mom show off the house at $2 a head.
 <br>
 He&#39;s lying to Jackie, man.
 <br>
 I lie to Jackie.
 <br>
 You know, it seems to me that the scrawny little neighbor boy is willing to engage in criminal acts for that saucy redhead next door.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 How do you know he&#39;s not doing it to impress his friends? You know, peer pressure.
 <br>
 Because his friends aren&#39;t saucy.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s saucy.
 <br>
 Kelso? Please, I&#39;m saucier than Kelso.
 <br>
 Then the door burst open wide And my daddy stepped inside And he kissed my mama&#39;s face And he brushed her tears away The night Chicago died Would you turn that damn thing off? Keep your eyes peeled for that Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 Okey dokey.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 I see you&#39;ve got some new steins here.
 <br>
 Hi, I&#39;m 25.
 <br>
 I know I look young, but my dad asked me to come down here and pick up a tap for his keg.
 <br>
 And he&#39;s 43, so we&#39;re both legal.
 <br>
 No problem there.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not going to be drinking the beer or anything.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I don&#39;t believe in it but no offense to you.
 <br>
 - I think selling liquor is a great thing.
 <br>
 - Yeah, here you go.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - Because I&#39;m 25, right? - Because you&#39;ve got money.
 <br>
 - Yeah, but I am 25.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t need to be.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t drink a tap.
 <br>
 No, I can prove it you.
 <br>
 I got my IDs out in the wallet.
 <br>
 Happens all the time.
 <br>
 Take care.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I Leave, now.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Kelshmo.
 <br>
 Whatcha got there? Boy, that was really funny what you did with my name, Kelshmo.
 <br>
 I gotta go.
 <br>
 I believe this is yours.
 <br>
 - You broke his thing.
 <br>
 - And you gave it back.
 <br>
 - Yeah, that was great! - Yeah! So you see what I&#39;m saying about the poor man? Yes, you have made your point.
 <br>
 Many times.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a bad boy, he&#39;s had some rough breaks but he isn&#39;t bad in his soul.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Enough daiquiris for you.
 <br>
 Kitty, what do you look for in a man? I&#39;m married.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kind of through looking.
 <br>
 Kitty, you can always look.
 <br>
 It helps you to fantasize.
 <br>
 Like.
 <br>
 Some nights, I&#39;m doing the news with Walter Cronkite.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m just You know, I&#39;m gonna finish your daiquiri.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s broken.
 <br>
 - I got duct tape.
 <br>
 Duct tape? Do you know how much pressure runs through that tap? I got a whole roll of duct tape.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t work like this.
 <br>
 Forman, you need to get your dad&#39;s tap now.
 <br>
 My dad doesn&#39;t have a tap.
 <br>
 Red&#39;s got bicentennial swizzle sticks.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got fake lemons with real lemon juice.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got toothpicks shaped like swords.
 <br>
 Red Forman is a cocktail dad.
 <br>
 And cocktail dads have beer taps.
 <br>
 Yeah, come on, Eric, we never ask you for anything.
 <br>
 You guys ask me for everything.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s one more thing? No, forget it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve done enough today already.
 <br>
 Count me out.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelshmo, what, your tap is broken? Why&#39;d you do something stupid like buy a stupid, broken tap? What are you stupid? It wasn&#39;t broken until you broke it.
 <br>
 Man.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t beat yourself up.
 <br>
 You had no way of knowing.
 <br>
 - Anyways, we gave it back.
 <br>
 - Yeah, broken.
 <br>
 Lay off him, all right? He feels bad enough already.
 <br>
 - He should because he&#39;s a moron.
 <br>
 - What did you say? I said that you&#39;re both morons.
 <br>
 What are you going to do? You&#39;re gonna beat me up? What, you weigh The fact is that the tap is broken and it&#39;s your fault.
 <br>
 Morons.
 <br>
 You are so rude.
 <br>
 Give us our $4 back.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Familiar? Wow, Eric, you just tore their money.
 <br>
 And gave it back.
 <br>
 That was great.
 <br>
 That was awesome.
 <br>
 But enough of this levity, wench! We came here to have a party and as God is my witness, there will be a party! Nope, I haven&#39;t sold a keg all day, but a young guy did come in for a tap.
 <br>
 Young guy Look, they got Pina Colada in a can.
 <br>
 - Bob! We&#39;re doing something here.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 You know, I might have heard something about a party.
 <br>
 Can&#39;t recall.
 <br>
 Maybe Andrew Jackson could remind me.
 <br>
 Andrew Jackson? He&#39;s not in.
 <br>
 But Abe Lincoln&#39;s hanging out with the Washington twins.
 <br>
 Would they have any knowledge of the festivities? So, a real wisenheimer, huh? Well, let&#39;s see how smart you are when I snap off your head! Okay, man.
 <br>
 They said something about a vacant house on Sherman.
 <br>
 I know that place.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the vacant house on Sherman.
 <br>
 Good work, Starsky.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s roll.
 <br>
 Everybody in the deep end! My mother is showing the house! - Now? - People work.
 <br>
 Okay, quiet down, everybody.
 <br>
 The deck is new and this lovely tile walkway leads directly to the pool Which is filled with some of the local kids.
 <br>
 Heavily Caucasian.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a nice neighborhood.
 <br>
 Sometimes Bob pretends he&#39;s poor.
 <br>
 I call him Buster.
 <br>
 He knocks on the door, and I answer it in my teddy.
 <br>
 And he says, &#34;Does the rich lady need any help around the house?&#34; And I say, &#34;I know a something that needs attending to &#34;in the bedroom.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;ll spare you the intimate details but it ends in whoopee.
 <br>
 You know, this is as much fun to make as it is to eat.
 <br>
 You know, speaking of which, how do you get Bob to play those games? I have a reward system.
 <br>
 You know, sometimes Red would wear a sailor&#39;s uniform.
 <br>
 Really? Yeah, but he was in the Navy.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 Does he still have his sailor&#39;s uniform? No.
 <br>
 Just has the hat.
 <br>
 I stole my dad&#39;s tap back from those thieves.
 <br>
 - We were worried sick.
 <br>
 - You had us driving all over town.
 <br>
 We missed Rich Man, Poor Man.
 <br>
 - Excuse us, Red.
 <br>
 - What are you doing? - We&#39;re just gonna grab this keg - Get out of here! - We&#39;re not finished with this.
 <br>
 - Neither are we.
 <br>
 Now, you take her home and you wait for me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s an order.
 <br>
 Ditto.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t stay mad at you with that cute face.
 <br>
 Get your ugly butt home.
 <br>
 My dad&#39;s gonna kill me.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always saying that.
 <br>
 Yeah, this time he&#39;s gonna kill me.
 <br>
 I mean, I cut class I trespassed, I had stolen beer and then I swung into a pool full of cops on a garden hose carrying my dad&#39;s tap.
 <br>
 Yeah, that was so cool.
 <br>
 Really? Really.
 <br>
 You looked dangerous.
 <br>
 Did I mention that I killed a guy in algebra? Good night, killer.
 <br>
 Bring it on, Red.
 <br>
 I love that boy.
 <br>
 - Eric&#39;s a good kid.
 <br>
 - And that Donna&#39;s real sweet, too.
 <br>
 Man, that Donna&#39;s real hot.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s my daughter.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m just saying that - I know what you&#39;re saying.
 <br>
 - All right, Bob, it&#39;s time to go.
 <br>
 - We&#39;ll just take the - Get out of here! All right.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
