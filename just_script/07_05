<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 doesn&#39;t anybody want to ask me how I&#39;m feeling? Well, of course.
 <br>
 Eric, ask your mother how she&#39;s feeling.
 <br>
 How are you feeling, mom? Unneeded, unnecessary and unloved.
 <br>
 Oh, you set me up.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s no one for me to take care of.
 <br>
 Steven&#39;s off with his dad, you&#39;re busy with your silly not-working projects, and we haven&#39;t heard from laurie since she moved to canada.
 <br>
 Where bottomless dancing is legal.
 <br>
 Cheer up, kitty.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll always have me to take care of.
 <br>
 Oh, the way you eat, you&#39;ll be dead long before me.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re the one that puts bacon on everything.
 <br>
 - I do not.
 <br>
 - Last week you put bacon on ham.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s my fault.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t wait to be married.
 <br>
 All right, fine.
 <br>
 Look, we could talk all day, but I see one little fella that still needs your attention.
 <br>
 We still have schotzie? I thought he ran away.
 <br>
 No, he&#39;s been hiding underneath the house.
 <br>
 For a year? Poor little fella.
 <br>
 He&#39;s afraid of the garden hose.
 <br>
 Look, mom, maybe you should stop worrying about everyone else so much and start thinking about yourself.
 <br>
 Maybe you should find something to enrich your life.
 <br>
 Oh, may I suggest the teachings of the jedi? And may I suggest the footing of your ass? this is not the ass you&#39;re looking for.
 <br>
 See, now you don&#39;t know what to do.
 <br>
 You guys, yesterday at the salon I gave a shampoo to tina simpson.
 <br>
 And you know what? She has a lumpy head.
 <br>
 Oh, gross.
 <br>
 I made out with her in the tenth grade.
 <br>
 If I&#39;d have known she had a lumpy head, I would have felt around up there.
 <br>
 Well, I mean, it&#39;s gross, but you want to feel it, right? You guys, listen to this ad.
 <br>
 &#34;Do you like to draw?&#34; Well, I have been known to trace my hand and turn it into a turkey.
 <br>
 &#34;If so, have your artistic ability evaluated &#34;by the cartoon academy of fort lauderdale.
 <br>
 &#34; Ooh.
 <br>
 I think picasso went there.
 <br>
 All I have to do is send in my drawing of sanchez the turtle and a money order for $19.
 <br>
 95.
 <br>
 20 bucks to get judged by a panel of cartoon experts? I&#39;d pay twice that.
 <br>
 Steven, you cannot go to your first day at your dad&#39;s company dressed like that.
 <br>
 You&#39;re working there, not digging a ditch to there.
 <br>
 Jackie, he owns a chain of record stores.
 <br>
 This is the official uniform of rock &#39;n&#39; roll.
 <br>
 I&#39;m dressed to jam.
 <br>
 I agree with jackie.
 <br>
 You clean up so nice.
 <br>
 Let the world see what I see.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m drawing sanchez the turtle.
 <br>
 I made a little bubble where he&#39;s saying, &#34;what&#39;s the hurry, guys?&#34; Watch your back, &#34;doonesbury.
 <br>
 &#34; - All right, steven, you know, I really think you-- - Lay off, okay? I&#39;m dressed fine.
 <br>
 Really? What&#39;s the job? Are they looking for an entry-level hobo? Actually, I&#39;m hoping to get to listen to the records and pick which ones the stores carry.
 <br>
 In which case, bye-bye, andy gibb.
 <br>
 What do you have against good-looking guys? We&#39;re just like you, except for much better-looking.
 <br>
 You know what you should do? Bring back swing music.
 <br>
 Hey, sue me.
 <br>
 I like a song I can throw a lady around to.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 05 &#34;&#34; here&#39;s where you&#39;ll be working, son.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s pretty grim.
 <br>
 So is this where we interrogate the political prisoners? So, um, - where&#39;s all the records at? - Right here.
 <br>
 These papers are the sales records for all of our stores in the greater tri-county area.
 <br>
 These aren&#39;t the kind of papers I thought I&#39;d be working with.
 <br>
 I thought they&#39;d be smaller and wrapped around something illegal.
 <br>
 Look, I don&#39;t wanna bum you out, but we kind of have a dress code here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re dressed pretty casual.
 <br>
 Yeah, but this is silk.
 <br>
 You couldn&#39;t pull it off.
 <br>
 Steven, I love your closet.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your office? Did you follow me here? And you never even saw me.
 <br>
 See, the trick is, is to stay two cars behind and one to the left.
 <br>
 Oh, here.
 <br>
 I brought you a very special lunch, and it&#39;s wrapped in a suit and tie.
 <br>
 Wear it.
 <br>
 A suit? See, she has the right idea.
 <br>
 Well, I told him to dress nicer.
 <br>
 But he&#39;s poor, and that&#39;s your fault.
 <br>
 Steven, we&#39;re gonna be evaluating store profits from last quarter, so your job is to go through these records and to underline every instance of the word &#34;credit.
 <br>
 &#34; That&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna be doing my whole first day? First day? Ha! It&#39;ll take you a week.
 <br>
 Well, if you get bored, do what I do--play golf.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t play golf.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t leave anyway.
 <br>
 What exactly are they doing? I&#39;m not sure.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s like a karate that kills you with jiggle.
 <br>
 And  that&#39;s how you do tai chi.
 <br>
 Are you boys ready to try? No, I think we need to watch you two do it a little bit more.
 <br>
 They&#39;re not trying to learn, mom.
 <br>
 Otherwise  they wouldn&#39;t have brought lawn chairs and fudgesicles.
 <br>
 Kelso, I thought you were gonna start respecting women now that you have a daughter.
 <br>
 I am, but you two are grandfathered in.
 <br>
 I really don&#39;t see what the big deal is, bob.
 <br>
 We brought this tray over to you full of cookies.
 <br>
 You should have brought it back full of cookies.
 <br>
 That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.
 <br>
 - What are you two doing? - It&#39;s tai chi.
 <br>
 It&#39;s an ancient form of exercise and meditation.
 <br>
 It originated in the far east in a place called los angeles.
 <br>
 - Seems really interesting.
 <br>
 Can I try? - Sure.
 <br>
 I&#39;d stay out here and try it with you, but I&#39;d rather go inside and eat.
 <br>
 So the key is to relax and find your inner peace.
 <br>
 Seems a little exotic, but if this tai chi is half as good as a mai tai, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m gonna love it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the new guy, huh? I&#39;m dennis.
 <br>
 I&#39;m hyde.
 <br>
 Mondays, huh? I guess.
 <br>
 Well, you picked a good week to start.
 <br>
 We just got a new copy machine.
 <br>
 It&#39;s already broken.
 <br>
 I&#39;m really unhappy.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Donna was right.
 <br>
 I do need to start respecting women, so I decided to donate my entire &#34;playboy&#34; collection to the needy.
 <br>
 Here you go, fez.
 <br>
 You&#39;re giving fez a box full of nudie magazines? That&#39;s like giving a monkey a loaded gun.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s not.
 <br>
 A monkey with a loaded gun can hurt a lot of people.
 <br>
 I can only hurt myself.
 <br>
 But a monkey with a loaded gun would be an awesome tv show.
 <br>
 Everybody would be, like, &#34;aw, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a monkey,&#34;and then bam! Thanks for taking me to get my tai chi supplies.
 <br>
 What was that wonderful store called again? Point place meditation supply and dried fruit depot.
 <br>
 Well, that is so clever.
 <br>
 Really? Wow.
 <br>
 Your clever threshold&#39;s really low.
 <br>
 This colors a lot of the compliments that you&#39;ve given me.
 <br>
 I just love my new buddy.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s called a buddha.
 <br>
 No, that is not even a word.
 <br>
 Next you&#39;ll tell me butter is called &#34;booder.
 <br>
 &#34; What&#39;s going on back here? Hey, look! You got a thing of me.
 <br>
 I am making this space my tai chi area.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re gonna be out here, and I&#39;ll be in there alone? I love tai chi.
 <br>
 Eric, I got a job for you.
 <br>
 Go grab some cement and secure that bob statue.
 <br>
 Okay, if that&#39;s a job, then how much does that pay? It pays my foot not going in your ass.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s on credit then.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Hey, donna, look! Ho, ho, ho! I can&#39;t tell you how good it makes me feel to look in here and see my own son.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it going? Well, I&#39;m kind of glad there&#39;s not a window in here.
 <br>
 Probably would have jumped out of it.
 <br>
 Ah, you kids with your suicide jokes.
 <br>
 finally finished.
 <br>
 Bad news, hyde.
 <br>
 Sales decided it would be more efficient to whiteout the credits and underline the debits instead.
 <br>
 But but but I underlined credits.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re interested, I have some stuff that can help you get through the day.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m interested.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 What are you talking aut? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Licorice.
 <br>
 Get out of my office! &#34;Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
 <br>
 &#34; and finished.
 <br>
 Eric, this looks nothing like me.
 <br>
 Oh, I wasn&#39;t drawing you.
 <br>
 I just wanted you to shut up for a little while.
 <br>
 steven! How was your first day at work? Damn,  jackie, can&#39;t I sit down and have a beer before you start in on me? Sorry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the store in skokie.
 <br>
 The numbers just don&#39;t add up.
 <br>
 Hey, have you guys seen fez? He was supposed to meet me at the hub an hour ago.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s the last place you saw him? Down in the basement with a box full of &#34;playboys.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, my god.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get the first-aid kit.
 <br>
 We&#39;re too late.
 <br>
 He suffered a massive horny attack.
 <br>
 We&#39;re gonna need some gatorade and a couple of ice packs.
 <br>
 Back off! They&#39;re mine! They&#39;re all mine! Fez, we&#39;re here to help you.
 <br>
 You need to stop, &#39;cause people gotta sit on this couch.
 <br>
 Okay, I say we put him and the couch out on the curb.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Look, fez there&#39;s a reason that these magazines only come once a month.
 <br>
 You have to pace yourself.
 <br>
 Do something else besides look at pornography.
 <br>
 What  kind of a life is that? By the way, any plans you had with me, they&#39;re now off until further notice.
 <br>
 I&#39;m having trouble concentrating.
 <br>
 me too.
 <br>
 That dog is loud.
 <br>
 What dog? Please stop barking, schotzie.
 <br>
 Mommy&#39;s doing her tai chi.
 <br>
 it&#39;s not very considerate to bark during mommy&#39;s quiet time, schotzie.
 <br>
 shut your freakin&#39; trap! This is so soothing.
 <br>
 So, Steven, you&#39;re first day at work.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know how much longer I&#39;m gonna be working there.
 <br>
 I was getting a cup of coffee, today.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 This guy walks up to me and says, &#34;workin&#39; hard or hardly workin&#39;?&#34; I threw my powdered milk at him.
 <br>
 See, that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking forward to about being an artist-- loving my job.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t get me wrong.
 <br>
 It can be torture waiting for inspiration to strike, but it&#39;s nice, because that gives me time to go bowling.
 <br>
 Did you secure that statue of bob yet? I didn&#39;t, but I could give you an artist&#39;s rendering of what that might look like.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna end up selling women&#39;s shoes.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if I can hack it, working in an office.
 <br>
 My tolerance for following directions is really low.
 <br>
 Which is ironic, because your tolerance for other things is really high.
 <br>
 Steven, everybody goes through the same thing, but the misery that you feel now will eventually be broken up by stretches of time where you will feel that you&#39;re happy.
 <br>
 Of course, you&#39;re not happy.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just too numb from your hellish life to feel the pain.
 <br>
 How was your day, red? Pretty good, actually.
 <br>
 Hey, W.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 , You got a sec? Steven, I heard what happened yesterday.
 <br>
 Perhaps I should have been more clear about our milk-throwing policy.
 <br>
 Look, man, I don&#39;t think I can work here anymore.
 <br>
 Well, why not? I just I don&#39;t belong here.
 <br>
 Dennis? Tuesdays, huh? Get outta here! - Look, I can&#39;t let you quit on me.
 <br>
 - You don&#39;t know me that well.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve quit on a lot of people.
 <br>
 No, I mean I won&#39;t let you quit.
 <br>
 You could have a really great future, but you need somebody to help you get started.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t there for you when you were growing up, so I want to do this.
 <br>
 Yeah, but a job? Can&#39;t you just, like, buy me a stereo? You&#39;re the boss&#39; son.
 <br>
 You really don&#39;t have to work that hard.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give it a week.
 <br>
 But what am I supposed to do with all those sales reports? Just give &#39;em to dennis.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I do.
 <br>
 Fez,  are you okay? I haven&#39;t seen you look this awful since you found out candyland&#39;s not a real country.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the bunnies, man.
 <br>
 I haven&#39;t slept in a week.
 <br>
 It&#39;s only been one day.
 <br>
 Fez, why would you do this to yourself? &#39;Cause he can&#39;t get anybody else to do it for him.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have the willpower to keep these magazines, kelso.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just a boy.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;d take &#39;em off your hands, but I don&#39;t want to actually touch your hands.
 <br>
 Okay, buddy.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;re better off.
 <br>
 Just hand the magazines over to me.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Fez, you&#39;re not letting go.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still holding on.
 <br>
 Look, a robot! Man, you fall for that every time.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, one day, there&#39;s gonna be a robot, and all you suckers are gonna miss it.
 <br>
 red, why are you out here? I thought you were so excited to have the house to yourself.
 <br>
 I got lonely.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t believe it.
 <br>
 They think I have &#34;no artistic talent.
 <br>
 &#34; You know, I&#39;m beginning to suspect that the cartoon academy of fort lauderdale isn&#39;t that legitimate.
 <br>
 okay.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Schotzie, it&#39;s time for you to have some quiet time behind the wall.
 <br>
 Well, I guess it&#39;s back to hand turkeys for me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what that means, but don&#39;t do it around here.
 <br>
 schotzie? You know, that statue was supposed to bring you peace and in a way, it did.
 <br>
 Loving my job now, men.
 <br>
 Being the boss&#39; son means never having to say, &#34;you&#39;ll have it by the end of the day.
 <br>
 &#34; Guys, fez is really overdoing it with the &#34;playboys.
 <br>
 &#34; This isn&#39;t like the time he ate a case of mars bars, either.
 <br>
 They can&#39;t pump your stomach for porn.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not so much worried about fez as I am schotzie.
 <br>
 He goes on the attack every time he sees that buddha statue.
 <br>
 And, weirdly, bob.
 <br>
 <br>
