<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Well! That was some county fair! And they really went all loud with the musical entertainment.
 <br>
 I mean, the Beach Girls were fabulous.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never seen the Beach Boys but I can not imagine they are any better.
 <br>
 Ah, the only thing worse than listening to those Beach Whales was watching Steven throw up after spending all day in the beer-garden.
 <br>
 I had a good reason to throw up.
 <br>
 I was drunk.
 <br>
 Oh, I wish I could say I&#39;ve been drunk the whole time I went out with you.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a good think you&#39;re not a drinker.
 <br>
 You&#39;d have a hard time operating that heavy machinery your mouth! Well, I had a great time.
 <br>
 I have an invisible dog in a leash, a goldfish in a bag and a giant stuffed panda, of course I got some stupid stuff too.
 <br>
 You now, Fez, you should be thanking Randy.
 <br>
 You were so amazing winning all that stuff.
 <br>
 With you hair flowing, your muscles rippling, you were like a Greek god of knocking things over.
 <br>
 Oh help, bazarus Knockoverus.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still drunk.
 <br>
 So how did you get so go at popping balloons with darts? Well, when my parents got divorced, I found comfort in the community of non judgment carnaval workers.
 <br>
 I taught them to read, in exchange they taught me how to play their game with chance.
 <br>
 - Really? - No, I got a dart board.
 <br>
 Well, you won every game in the place.
 <br>
 Donna, it must be nice to finally have a boyfriend who can swing that sledge hammer and get that little black thing passed Â« seriously hit.
 <br>
 Â» Now, you shush.
 <br>
 Eric always did very well at the fair.
 <br>
 Every time he went to that one booth, he walked away with his stuffed animal.
 <br>
 That was the gift shop.
 <br>
 Well, Mrs Forman, you won a prize too.
 <br>
 I cant&#39; believe you let that guy guess your weight.
 <br>
 And I can&#39;t believe the woman who almost married my son has already moved on to the next customer because she is as loose as an old Jim sock.
 <br>
 Whorus Maximus! And that weight guesser never had a chance once I took off my shoes, my belt, my engagement ring, spit up my gum and took out all the kleenex had in my pockets.
 <br>
 Oh Fez, honey, you never gave me back my ring.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Wow, so sparkly and last forever.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 8 Episode 15 &#34;Keep Yourself Alive&#34; Traduction par Mona Sax It&#39;s gone! My engagement ring is gooone.
 <br>
 You! You lost it! We let you in in our country, we we give you minimal wage jobs, we teach you how to use a knife and a fork, and this is how you thank us? Kitty I hate to see you so upset when there is such an easy solution.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just get your home, I&#39;ll make you a Martini, then when you calm down, I&#39;ll make you a Margarita.
 <br>
 Wait, uhm, what about us? Oh you&#39;re going to stay here and look for the ring.
 <br>
 And if it rains, just do like the Indians did, die! Okay, well, the ring must have rolled down the hill, which means, it&#39;s been probably eaten by a squirrel.
 <br>
 We need to find this squirrel, feed him laxatives and wait for the show to begin.
 <br>
 God, we&#39;re stuck out here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a bummer.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been waiting to take you me ever since you threw that ping pong ball into the floating tea cup.
 <br>
 Maybe we can sneak off.
 <br>
 You know, the woods can be pretty romantic.
 <br>
 That is unless you run into a serial killer, or a witch who lives in a house made of candy.
 <br>
 Hey,  you guys.
 <br>
 I was thinking that maybe we &#39;d find the ring faster if we split up in teams.
 <br>
 Say, Donna! It&#39;s a great idea! But who may I ask would go with whom? I get Donna.
 <br>
 Well, that way, if we run up into a bear, I can just climb you.
 <br>
 No, I was thinking I would go with Randy and you would go with Hyde.
 <br>
 No, no, no I am not teaming up with Steven.
 <br>
 That would be like Cher teaming up with the really smelly drunk.
 <br>
 Wow, guys, did you hear that? The wild core brown hair pygmy bitch.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t hear anything.
 <br>
 There it is again.
 <br>
 Man, this is what it&#39;s all about.
 <br>
 The outdoors, just us guys, talking man to man.
 <br>
 You know, Jackie is so annoying.
 <br>
 I never realized when we were going out.
 <br>
 Sometimes you got to marry a striper to get things into perspective.
 <br>
 Anyway, this is good.
 <br>
 The outdoors, just us guys, talking man to man, this is what&#39;s all about.
 <br>
 Yeahhh, hey can I team up with Donna? What? No! It&#39;s all about the guys! Oh, man, I can&#39;t get between you and Donna &#39;cause love that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about and drugs specially drugs, then love, but mostly drugs.
 <br>
 You know what I mean, man? Silence! That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.
 <br>
 Oh, this is just awful.
 <br>
 - Fine, I&#39;ll add more gin.
 <br>
 - No! Red, the ring.
 <br>
 And you know, this is all your fault.
 <br>
 If you hadn&#39;t driven like a mad man over a pothole, I wouldn&#39;t be drinking to calm my nerves, I would just be drinking.
 <br>
 Hey! I am not the one who gave his engagement ring to the foreign kid.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lucky he&#39;s not wearing it through his nose.
 <br>
 Oh, this is just the worse thing ever.
 <br>
 Kitty, it is just a ring.
 <br>
 I am talking about the drink.
 <br>
 Hey, there.
 <br>
 I was just putting out the thrash and heard you two had a little spat so I figured out you&#39;d probably want me to come and take a side.
 <br>
 Okay, well, my engagement ring is lost and Red doesn&#39;t give a damn.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t understand it because even if he doesn&#39;t care about the sentimental value, it still cost a thousand dollars.
 <br>
 A thousand bucks? So you finally replaced the old cheap one, eh? - Boooob - What? Oh, jeez.
 <br>
 You blew it now, Red.
 <br>
 The old cheap one, what&#39;s he talking about, Red? Kitty, I love you.
 <br>
 How much did my ring really cost? Right around a thousand dollars.
 <br>
 How much exactly? It does? Where the hell are you getting which is besides the point because you look lovely.
 <br>
 And you know what else looks lovely? The view from the couch, which is where you cheap lying butt will be sleeping tonight.
 <br>
 She&#39;s  right about that couch.
 <br>
 You got a great view of the TV from there.
 <br>
 Steven  is such a jerk.
 <br>
 You know, I can&#39;t believe I almost married a guy who can burp the alphabet all the way to W.
 <br>
 You know, he never finishes anything.
 <br>
 Well, Randy is perfect.
 <br>
 That lady at the fair, who did the caricatures, she refused to draw him because she couldn&#39;t find a flaw.
 <br>
 Oh, please, that lady had no talent.
 <br>
 Did you see how big she drew my mouth? - Hey! - Hey.
 <br>
 - Any luck finding that ring? - No but we did find a broken high heel, some old stockings and an empty pack of Marlboro&#39;s.
 <br>
 Yeah, so it looks like Steven&#39;s mom has been here too.
 <br>
 They&#39;re not my mom! She smoked Lucky&#39;s.
 <br>
 Well, maybe it&#39;s time we shake up search parties.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll flip a coin.
 <br>
 Head means Donna, tale means Jackie.
 <br>
 It&#39;s head, Donna, come on.
 <br>
 Wait, no, no, hum I can&#39;t go with Steven.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a disgusting pig.
 <br>
 Yeah, she&#39;s a suck-up princess who only cares about looks and money.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t try to sweet-talk me.
 <br>
 Okay, look, we&#39;re not going to find that stupid ring anyway so let&#39;s just get out of here.
 <br>
 Where is Fez? Well, Goldy, it seems we are lost in a dark, cold, lonely cave.
 <br>
 You look scared too, your eyes are bugging out of your head.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here cause at least I can have a conversation with a fish.
 <br>
 Otherwise I&#39;d be loosing my mind.
 <br>
 FEZ! Where is he? Oh, don&#39;t worry, he survived his trip over here in a banana crave, he&#39;ll be fine in the woods.
 <br>
 Actually, I&#39;m kind of worried about him: it&#39;s dark, it&#39;s cold, there&#39;s no pornography anywhere.
 <br>
 What was that? That was a wild Canadian boar.
 <br>
 They feed them likeable girls.
 <br>
 You&#39;re safe.
 <br>
 You know, being out here like this, without any TV, or magazines makes me realize how people Incredibly bored.
 <br>
 By the way, Donna.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re ever lost in the outdoors, just find the North Star.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gentle twinkling will confort you as you slowly die.
 <br>
 Oh, eww, what, now we have to cross a disgusting river? Jackie, it&#39;s a just a creek.
 <br>
 Okay, fine, why don&#39;t you take your shoe off, we&#39;ll all get in and raw ourselves across.
 <br>
 - Allow me my lady.
 <br>
 - Thank you.
 <br>
 Oh, eh wait, how I am supposed to get across.
 <br>
 Come across, like you always do, real bitchy! Oh you know what? Even when we were dating you never did the gentlemanly thing.
 <br>
 Alright, fine, give me your hand.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not touching that hand.
 <br>
 You have been burping in that hand all day.
 <br>
 Come on, you&#39;ve touched growser things than this.
 <br>
 You went out with Kelso for 4 years.
 <br>
 Oh! You know what, I&#39;ll just get myself across.
 <br>
 That couldn&#39;t have worked out any better.
 <br>
 Well, Goldy, if my internal clock is correct, we&#39;ve been here either an hour or a month.
 <br>
 Man, I&#39;m terribly thirsty.
 <br>
 I hope you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m gonna drink a little bit of your water.
 <br>
 You peed in there.
 <br>
 Well I made Bob go and get the kids.
 <br>
 Maybe they&#39;ll find the ring, maybe not, either way I got rid of Bob.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you lied to me about that ring.
 <br>
 Listen Kitty, when I got home from Korea, I wanted to buy you the nicest engagement ring ever.
 <br>
 But I wasn&#39;t making much money.
 <br>
 And when I realized how long I would have to save to get that ring, I just knew I couldn&#39;t wait that long to ask you to marry me.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s true, I had other offers.
 <br>
 Jimmy Callahan used to call me sweetny and he was absolutely right.
 <br>
 So I bought you the best that I could afford, I was going to tell you that we&#39;d get a better ring when we had the money, but then it all went wrong, you loved the ring and you said it must have cost a thousand dollars and you were so excited.
 <br>
 I just couldn&#39;t let you down.
 <br>
 Red And I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 If the kids don&#39;t find the old one, I&#39;ll get you another one, the kind that you deserve for putting up with me will all these years.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t want you to sell the house.
 <br>
 Hey Donna, you know when you see ducks flying in a V formation, one side longer than the other.
 <br>
 You know what that is? - No.
 <br>
 - More ducks! Hey, we lost Jackie and Hyde.
 <br>
 Finally, we&#39;re alone.
 <br>
 DONNAAA! That was magical.
 <br>
 Yeah, I hope I didn&#39;t get pregnant.
 <br>
 DONNAAA! Hey, you guys missed it! Jackie fell in the creek.
 <br>
 Will you shut up? I could get pneumonia and die.
 <br>
 This keeps getting funnier.
 <br>
 Alright but we still need to find Fez.
 <br>
 So why don&#39;t the girls stay here, Hyde and I are going to look for him.
 <br>
 Oh, I have a better idea.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get some meat ball sup, go to a strip-club.
 <br>
 Come on buddy, let&#39;s go find Fez.
 <br>
 Well, maybe Fez has a meat ball sup.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ve been holding this for like 3 hours and I can&#39;t do it anymore.
 <br>
 Yeah,  I know you like Randy, you&#39;re jealous of my hair, bla bla bla.
 <br>
 No, I drank to much and now I have to like go, so be my look-out.
 <br>
 You know, if this were a mall, you&#39;d be in a bathroom right now.
 <br>
 Of course you wouldn&#39;t be in a mall cause you might accidentally put on some new clothes.
 <br>
 Wait a minute, man, this looks familiar.
 <br>
 Like we just did a complete circle.
 <br>
 - Woh - Oh my God! No, I&#39;d remember this.
 <br>
 I win again! I  know you&#39;re just a fish, but come on! At least try! Fez, is that you? Goldy, you can use pronouns? No, Fez, it&#39;s me Bob! Bob, you find us! Alleluia! Yeap, I just followed the trail of candy corn you left.
 <br>
 But I didn&#39;t leave a oh, dammit! There was a hole.
 <br>
 All that candy corn wasted.
 <br>
 No, I ate &#39;em.
 <br>
 Bob, they were on the ground! Well, I would have done the same.
 <br>
 Donna, you don&#39;t have to be embarrassed, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Nobody cares.
 <br>
 In fact let&#39;s just sing a little camp fire song, alright I start.
 <br>
 Â«Twinkle, twinkle little star, Donna wees behind a bush.
 <br>
 Â» I just couldn&#39;t hold it anymore.
 <br>
 Why did I get the 48 ounce commemorative cup? Why didn&#39;t I go in the 48 ounce commemorative cup? I&#39;m not sure that relieving yourself in a cup would have made this any less humiliating.
 <br>
 This, this is why I hate the woods.
 <br>
 Every thing&#39;s a bathroom.
 <br>
 God, it&#39;s just like Delaware.
 <br>
 Oh! That reminds me of an old Delawarian folk song.
 <br>
 Â«Donna squatted in a bush, pee pee, doo doo, Donna squatted in a bush pee pee all day long.
 <br>
 Â» - Oh when the saints.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - Oh when the saints.
 <br>
 - go marching in.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 - go marching in.
 <br>
 Oh when the saints go marching in.
 <br>
 Dad? Oh Lord, I want to be in that number, Oh when the saints go marching in My dad and Fez are skipping through the woods.
 <br>
 And I peed on a bush.
 <br>
 I really should have gone to college.
 <br>
 Alright Jackie, I&#39;ll help you get across the creek.
 <br>
 Will you just leave me alone? Want to fall in again? Fine.
 <br>
 Steven! Man, I hope I&#39;ll remember that in the morning.
 <br>
 It&#39;s too bad, the kids never found your ring.
 <br>
 But on the upside, Pork Doodles! Oh, my Gosh! Oh my Gosh! It&#39;s my ring! It was in the car the whole time.
 <br>
 Oh that&#39;s great! It&#39;s like I always say: sometimes you find things! Kitty! Red! I&#39;ve just ordered you a new ring.
 <br>
 The diamond is almost a carat.
 <br>
 The band is white gold.
 <br>
 The jeweller said it was the nicest one he had.
 <br>
 Oh Well That sounds beautiful.
 <br>
 I know it won&#39;t have all sentimental value of the old one, but.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 But that ring is gone forever.
 <br>
 Goldy, it&#39;s not right to keep you in a tiny bag like this.
 <br>
 A goldfish belongs in the wild.
 <br>
 Never easy to say goodbye, specially to a fish.
 <br>
 I am not sure where your ears are.
 <br>
 There you go.
 <br>
 Swim Goldy, swim.
 <br>
 Fly Goldy, fly.
 <br>
 <br>
