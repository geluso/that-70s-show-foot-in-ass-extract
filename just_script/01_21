 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 From up here, Point Place looks just like Paris.
 <br>
 You think that looks like Paris? God, no wonder you think Kelso could be a model.
 <br>
 Whoa, I could so be a model.
 <br>
 Come on, man.
 <br>
 Shut up and just keep painting.
 <br>
 It&#39;s done! Gentlemen, we have finally done it.
 <br>
 A pot leaf on the water tower.
 <br>
 This is the proudest moment of my life.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t look like a pot leaf.
 <br>
 What? It looks like a hand giving the finger.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t have to look perfect, Hyde.
 <br>
 It&#39;s art.
 <br>
 Get up and make it better.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Just, yeah, make it wider right up there.
 <br>
 Yeah, out further, though.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Right up there My God! Michael! Kelso! Yeah? How&#39;s it look from down there? It looks like it&#39;s giving me the finger.
 <br>
 You guys, this is so stupid.
 <br>
 We should just take him to the hospital.
 <br>
 No, Jackie, then my dad will find out.
 <br>
 Shut up.
 <br>
 My mom&#39;s a nurse.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll wake her up.
 <br>
 Maybe she can fix him.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t wake up Red though, he&#39;ll kill us all.
 <br>
 - Gee, you think? Red.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Everybody hop in the car and let&#39;s go now.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your mom? Shut up.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you dare talk about my mother! Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! No.
 <br>
 Dad.
 <br>
 No, there is no way this could&#39;ve been avoided.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Yeah, the cow kicked me after I tipped it over.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not lying! Okay, all right, I love you, too.
 <br>
 He bought it.
 <br>
 Excuse me, yes.
 <br>
 My friend and I would like our sponge baths now, please.
 <br>
 - Eric, are you all right? - They were sleeping! Michael, as God is my witness, I will nurse you back to health.
 <br>
 Thanks, Jackie.
 <br>
 I&#39;m in a lot of pain.
 <br>
 My poor baby.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 Whoever wants a ride? Hey, sorry about tonight, you guys.
 <br>
 Sorry? Why? We got to watch you fall, man.
 <br>
 I had a blast! See you, Kelso.
 <br>
 Hyde is such a jerk.
 <br>
 This is all his fault.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? Who said the pot leaf wasn&#39;t good enough? Hyde did.
 <br>
 And who said you should lean out further? Hyde did.
 <br>
 So, who made you fall off the water tower? No, wait, Jackie, that&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 Hyde&#39;s like my best friend.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Brian Piccolo and Gayle Sayers were best friends.
 <br>
 Brian&#39;s Song.
 <br>
 I love that movie.
 <br>
 See, Michael, Gayle held Brian&#39;s hand and cried and gave him sips of cool water in his hospital bed.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 So where are you now? In a hospital bed.
 <br>
 And where&#39;s Hyde? He isn&#39;t giving me sips of cool water, that&#39;s for sure! Well, we got vandals in this town.
 <br>
 I was driving home and I saw the water tower giving me the finger.
 <br>
 Vandals you say? Where were you last night, Eric? Can it, Laurie.
 <br>
 Eric, you look pale.
 <br>
 Let me see your eyes.
 <br>
 Look at me.
 <br>
 Do you have a fever? I know what you need.
 <br>
 Right after breakfast, I want you to mow the lawn.
 <br>
 The fresh air will do you good.
 <br>
 Eric, is something bothering you? God, make it stop! Kitty.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Kitty.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 Well, okay, now so far Eric is nine out of ten.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got bloodshot eyes, mood swings irregular appetite, odd sleeping patterns.
 <br>
 Red, our Johnny is high.
 <br>
 Kitty, that&#39;s nonsense.
 <br>
 He&#39;s not on drugs he&#39;s just weird.
 <br>
 Morning.
 <br>
 Hungry? I overslept.
 <br>
 I&#39;m late for school.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Bye.
 <br>
 That kid&#39;s on dope.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll say.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Sunday.
 <br>
 Boy, these after school specials are thrilling.
 <br>
 I mean, who knew it takes only one beer to turn a cheerleader into a whore? You know, Fez, this show contains an important message.
 <br>
 That very thing happened to a good friend of mine.
 <br>
 Really? May I ask who? Man, that is one drunk, slutty cheerleader.
 <br>
 - There go her pom poms.
 <br>
 - All right, that is quite enough! Everywhere I look now it&#39;s sex, sex, sex.
 <br>
 It&#39;s disgusting and I, for one, will not have it in my basement! Eric, what&#39;s wrong with you? Well, excuse me, Donna, for having a little moral fiber.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to go check on Michael.
 <br>
 Yeah, how&#39;s he doing? Yeah, like you care.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you just apologize? Apologize for what? If you don&#39;t know then obviously, you&#39;re a big, fat jerk.
 <br>
 Okay, she&#39;s nuts.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 You are not fat.
 <br>
 - Eric.
 <br>
 - Get off of my mom.
 <br>
 What? What is it with you? You&#39;ve been extra losery lately.
 <br>
 I saw Mom and Dad having sex.
 <br>
 You poor thing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Baby&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 Laurie, it was horrible.
 <br>
 And I can&#39;t get the image out of my mind.
 <br>
 I mean, it was Mom and Dad, but they were They were like a pair of wildebeests on a National Geographic Special.
 <br>
 Deep in the unexplored psyche of a confused young man is a wilderness called wild Wisconsin.
 <br>
 After several days of tracking we&#39;ve finally located the den of the wily Red.
 <br>
 Here we see Suburbus Sexmaniacus tracking his prey through the living room.
 <br>
 Observe as the male indicates his interest in mating by making loud, aggressive noises.
 <br>
 The female&#39;s attractive double knit pantsuit and scarlet lips signal her readiness.
 <br>
 This display is not lost on the male.
 <br>
 Here he goes.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s watch.
 <br>
 Eric, I am so sorry.
 <br>
 But you have to understand.
 <br>
 Mom and Dad are in love.
 <br>
 - They have urges and needs just like us.
 <br>
 - No urges.
 <br>
 No needs.
 <br>
 I learned in psychology class that what you went through is traumatic.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 Many people have had this same experience.
 <br>
 Really? And they turned out all right? Well, some of them turned out to be serial killers.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just a coincidence.
 <br>
 But whatever.
 <br>
 You know what the sad thing is? I actually think you&#39;re trying to be nice.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just not my strong suit.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;ll be all right? No.
 <br>
 Donna, I&#39;m really not in the mood.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just trying to get a little action here.
 <br>
 Donna, I just can&#39;t.
 <br>
 Come on, all the other guys are doing it.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on? Are you, like, mad at me or something? I Donna, I saw my parents having sex.
 <br>
 God! Yee! Yeah.
 <br>
 And you liked it, right? No! God, no! That&#39;s sick! Everyone&#39;s sick! I&#39;m kidding, Eric, I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 Good one.
 <br>
 All right, look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna tell you something I&#39;ve never told anybody else all right? When I was 12, I saw my parents doing it.
 <br>
 How did you get over it? At first I was, like, completely freaked out.
 <br>
 But then, eventually, the pain receded and I was able to live again.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t see this receding.
 <br>
 I mean, I walked in on Red and Kitty and they were They were right in the middle.
 <br>
 God, that&#39;s nothing.
 <br>
 I caught my parents outside, in broad daylight, on my hammock.
 <br>
 Where I used to read, like, my Nancy Drew mysteries.
 <br>
 That is so much worse than mine.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 I can remember, like, little bits of naked skin peeking through the holes of the hammock.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird, but knowing what you went through just makes me feel so much better.
 <br>
 - Because you&#39;re, like, totally over it, right? - And later they came inside and they had, like, this checkerboard pattern all over their arms and legs.
 <br>
 And my dad laughed and said they fell asleep on the hammock.
 <br>
 But I knew it was a lie.
 <br>
 I knew what he did to my mom.
 <br>
 Your mom.
 <br>
 - Okay, I&#39;m ready to fool around.
 <br>
 - Please take me home.
 <br>
 Look, Jackie, it&#39;s my friends.
 <br>
 Eric, Donna, and Fez.
 <br>
 Yep, that&#39;s all my friends.
 <br>
 Kelso, if you have something to say to me, why don&#39;t you just say it? No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I think you have something to say to me.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna be right over here when you&#39;re ready.
 <br>
 All right, this is stupid.
 <br>
 - Hyde, just apologize already.
 <br>
 - Forman, it&#39;s not my fault.
 <br>
 Whatever, he thinks it is.
 <br>
 It is.
 <br>
 You made me fall off the water tower.
 <br>
 How? Did I push you? - Well, no, but - Did I make the railing slippery? - No.
 <br>
 - Then how is it my fault? Because you didn&#39;t like my artwork.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t respect me, and you laugh at me and you&#39;re inconsiderate of my feelings.
 <br>
 Kelso, no offense, but you sound like a chick.
 <br>
 What Man, I do! Okay, all right.
 <br>
 Do you remember that time when I was climbing your fence and I hit my forehead on that tree branch, and I fell into your yard and your dog Yogi came out of the house and bit me twice on the ass? Yeah.
 <br>
 You bled and you cried.
 <br>
 - I bled, I didn&#39;t cry.
 <br>
 - Yeah, you did.
 <br>
 You bled and you cried.
 <br>
 And you laughed, man.
 <br>
 A lot.
 <br>
 While I was bleeding.
 <br>
 - Do you see my point? - Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s funny when friends get hurt.
 <br>
 Close enough.
 <br>
 - Sorry.
 <br>
 - Hey, stop talking like a chick.
 <br>
 God, you&#39;re both idiots.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Your father and I have noticed that you&#39;ve been acting very strange lately.
 <br>
 Like a hippie.
 <br>
 - Is there something you want to tell us? - Are you on dope? Are you? Because we can help you get clean.
 <br>
 - There&#39;s counseling, hospitalization - My foot kicking your ass.
 <br>
 Mom, Dad, I&#39;m not on drugs.
 <br>
 What a relief.
 <br>
 You have no idea Kitty, he&#39;s lying.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what the hopheads do.
 <br>
 Dad, I swear, I&#39;m not on drugs.
 <br>
 Then, what the hell&#39;s wrong with you? I accidentally I was upstairs and I Okay, you know what, I&#39;m on drugs.
 <br>
 For God&#39;s sake, he saw you guys doing it! There.
 <br>
 I helped.
 <br>
 Honey.
 <br>
 - Were your father and I having intercourse? - Mom.
 <br>
 No wonder you&#39;ve been acting so weird.
 <br>
 Red, say something.
 <br>
 Make him feel better.
 <br>
 It&#39;s more fun than it looks.
 <br>
 - Red.
 <br>
 - What? What do you want me to say? Look, you know what? You guys do it.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m okay with that.
 <br>
 So thanks.
 <br>
 Sure thing.
 <br>
 I just hope you learned your lesson.
 <br>
 Yes, sir.
 <br>
 I did.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 What lesson? Always knock.
 <br>
 - Even in the middle of the afternoon.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Damn, that was funny.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know how funny it is.
 <br>
 I mean, what if that had been you walking in on your parents.
 <br>
 And your mother was a dancer.
 <br>
 I imagine that would have been quite something.
 <br>
 Quit it, Kitty.
 <br>
 Hey, don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Now, stop it.
 <br>
 Boy, Kelso is going to be so happy that I finished his graffiti.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I am very talented.
 <br>
 I No.
 <br>
 I am hurt.
 <br>
 And all alone.
 <br>
 And it is giving me the finger.
 <br>
