 [Grunting] [Mumbling] Kelso, what&#39;s with the gym shorts? Oh, something happened.
 <br>
 I had to take my pants off.
 <br>
 Do you shave your legs? No.
 <br>
 It&#39;s- They&#39;re just naturally smooth.
 <br>
 Shut up! Not to worry, Kelso.
 <br>
 The Puberty Bunny will visit you soon.
 <br>
 So, lab partner I guess you and I are gonna be spending a lot of time together now, huh? Yeah, Shelly.
 <br>
 And, uh, good thing too &#39;cause, you know, I just shouldn&#39;t be alone around a Bunsen burner.
 <br>
 [Laughing] That is so funny! Let me go tell my friends you&#39;re driving me home.
 <br>
 Looks like Shelly has a thing for Forman.
 <br>
 Yes, and Forman has a thing for Shelly.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s in his pants.
 <br>
 Oh, good one, Fez.
 <br>
 Watch.
 <br>
 Shelly&#39;s gonna invite you over to her house when her folks aren&#39;t home.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what slutty girls do.
 <br>
 So, Eric, my parents aren&#39;t home.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go to my house.
 <br>
 - [Door Closes] - Huh.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you have a girlfriend? Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what&#39;s great about it.
 <br>
 See, maybe Donna will get jealous and her and Shelly will wrestle over you.
 <br>
 - Kelso, that&#39;s the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
 <br>
 - Oh, yeah? Think about it.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s mine! - No, he&#39;s mine! - I had him first! - You&#39;re going down! Kelso, that&#39;s the smartest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! [Jukebox: Rock] Are you sure you don&#39;t want to study at my house? I mean, it&#39;s just sitting there all empty.
 <br>
 No, come on, this place was made- [Shouting] This- this place was made for studying! Well, okay.
 <br>
 - Hey, Eric.
 <br>
 - Hey, Shelly, look.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my girlfriend, Donna.
 <br>
 Hi, girlfriend Donna.
 <br>
 Hi, Donna.
 <br>
 You know, Eric, we&#39;ll do this later, when we can be alone.
 <br>
 To study.
 <br>
 We were just studying.
 <br>
 - Eric, you got to hear this- - We were just studying, Donna, that&#39;s all.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m telling a story here.
 <br>
 Kelso was running through the cafeteria and there were these mashed potatoes on the floor- She&#39;s just my lab partner! So, mellow out! God! Uh-huh.
 <br>
 So, Kelso slips on the potatoes slides into a pole with his legs spread, totally wracks himself.
 <br>
 And everybody starts throwing their carrots and their cheese at him chanting- &#34;Tater nuts! Tater nuts!&#34; It was awesome! So, wait.
 <br>
 Even though I&#39;m spending time with Shelly, you&#39;re not jealous? [Chuckles] I&#39;m sorry, but you and Shelly? - What does that mean? - It means that she can have anyone.
 <br>
 And what does that mean? - Oh, you&#39;re sweet.
 <br>
 - Get off of me! Well, there&#39;s the little patient.
 <br>
 So, how&#39;d it go at the doctor&#39;s? Well, let me put it this way.
 <br>
 If a horse is in good shape, they say it&#39;s healthy as me.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 And did they say something about your pants being on fire, liar, liar? - No.
 <br>
 - I just got off the phone with Dr.
 <br>
 Leggett.
 <br>
 He said your blood pressure is through the roof.
 <br>
 Well, Kitty, who are you gonna believe? Some quack doctor or the man who stood by you while you delivered our children? Oh, you did not.
 <br>
 You went out for a sub.
 <br>
 Red, from now on, I am going to make sure you eat right.
 <br>
 No meat, no cheese and no beer.
 <br>
 No beer? You- Ohh! [Groaning] Oh, that&#39;s it, Kitty.
 <br>
 Ohh! You&#39;ve killed me.
 <br>
 [Groaning] I see the light.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that, Lord? It&#39;s okay to eat meat and beer and cheese? Okay, I&#39;ll- I&#39;ll tell her.
 <br>
 What that&#39;s, Lord? Dry toast and oatmeal.
 <br>
 Will do.
 <br>
 Man, Donna saw Shelly practically living in my lap.
 <br>
 How could she not be jealous? I&#39;m hot.
 <br>
 It&#39;s because you are decent, good-hearted and pure.
 <br>
 You know, a sissy.
 <br>
 Forman, I think what we need here is some input from Tater Nuts.
 <br>
 Tater Nuts, what do you think, Tater Nuts? Eric, this- Hey, stop calling me Tater Nuts! If Donna&#39;s not jealous, I mean, it means, basically, you&#39;re in the free and clear.
 <br>
 She&#39;s giving you the okay to cheat.
 <br>
 You gotta cheat! Hmm.
 <br>
 Tater Nuts makes sense.
 <br>
 [Kelso] Quit it.
 <br>
 ! I mean, I could be with Shelly right now, if I wanted to.
 <br>
 So, why shouldn&#39;t I? Because then you will have two women when some people have none! Forget it, Forman.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not a cheater.
 <br>
 You know, a wise man once said, &#34;Know thyself.
 <br>
 &#34; That man&#39;s name was Tater Nuts.
 <br>
 I got to be honest with you, guys.
 <br>
 Okay, l- I do shave my legs.
 <br>
 I just- I just like the way it feels.
 <br>
 No! Come on now! Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Look, we&#39;re not gonna be able to hang out tonight.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got to go to the library with Shelly.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 We can just hang out tomorrow night.
 <br>
 No, yeah, no.
 <br>
 See, yeah, I&#39;m gonna have my hands full with this Project that&#39;s due in a few days so I&#39;ll be off alone with Shelly.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t wear a bra, you know.
 <br>
 Yeah, whatever.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Farmhand got ahold of the rich lady.
 <br>
 - [Clears Throat] - Oh, hi, kids.
 <br>
 Your dad&#39;s not really a farmhand.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just a little intimacy game we&#39;re playing.
 <br>
 - And it&#39;s fun! - Yeah.
 <br>
 [Laughing] I&#39;m sorry you had to see that.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry I had to see that.
 <br>
 - Yeah, well, you know, Shelly&#39;s waiting for me.
 <br>
 So- - Yeah, Eric, you said that.
 <br>
 Okay, bye.
 <br>
 - He usually gives me a kiss good-bye.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 To be honest? It kinda grosses me out.
 <br>
 Wait, Jackie, should I be worried that he&#39;s spending so much time with Shelly? Okay, well, normally I&#39;d say yeah, but Eric would never cheat on you.
 <br>
 I mean, all guys cheat.
 <br>
 But I never really thought of Eric as a guy.
 <br>
 Yeah, he&#39;s more like a- like a really masculine girl.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 - Yeah, kind of like you.
 <br>
 Mmm! Lookee, lookee, lookee.
 <br>
 Ribs, corn bread and baked beans.
 <br>
 Come to Papa! Ow! Ooh, Papa been slapped.
 <br>
 No, now- now that food is for the kids.
 <br>
 But, here, um, l-I boiled you some skinless chicken.
 <br>
 Ew! It&#39;s gray! - Laurie! - I mean, it&#39;s gray, yea! Look, he&#39;s already home.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe I was so suspicious.
 <br>
 He&#39;s such a good guy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna write him a note.
 <br>
 A little, &#34;I love you.
 <br>
 &#34; [Giggles] You know, Michael once wrote me a sexy note.
 <br>
 Except, he can&#39;t really spell, so I didn&#39;t know what I was supposed to do to him.
 <br>
 [Gasps] Oh, my God! Donna, you should not leave your panties in your boyfriend&#39;s car.
 <br>
 - I didn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Oh! Oh.
 <br>
 - Is this your card? - No.
 <br>
 - Is this your card? - No.
 <br>
 - Is this your card? - No.
 <br>
 Ah, screw you.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, I had a dream about you last night.
 <br>
 - Really? - Yeah.
 <br>
 We were doing stuff, and it was all hot and sweaty and I just kept calling your name over and over.
 <br>
 [Inhales] &#34;Tater Nuts! Tater Nuts!&#34; [Laughing] Then what? Hey, Laurie, I found something in Eric&#39;s car that I think must probably be yours.
 <br>
 Is that- Oh, good heavens, it is.
 <br>
 I am in the presence of panties.
 <br>
 [Choir Singing] - [Ends] - Donna, please.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t wear pink panties.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 She&#39;d have to wear panties to wear pink panties.
 <br>
 Hyde, did you have a girl in Eric&#39;s car? No.
 <br>
 Oh, but I did have some nachos in there.
 <br>
 And to mess with Forman, I smeared cheese underneath the seat so it&#39;d really stink.
 <br>
 - Did it stink in there? - Kind of.
 <br>
 - All right! - Well, then, whose are they? Hello? You have not asked me.
 <br>
 Could they not be Fez&#39;s panties? I mean, is that so hard to imagine, Fez in a car with a woman? - Whose could they be? - [Murmuring, Indistinct] All right, Donna, here.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll figure this out.
 <br>
 I like to think of myself as the Columbo of panties.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;d say we&#39;re looking at a woman.
 <br>
 Ages 16 to 38 with a five-figure income.
 <br>
 She lives within a four-mile radius of here and is very popular with the gentlemen.
 <br>
 Sure, she is.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll have sex in a car that stinks like cheese.
 <br>
 So, what you&#39;re saying is, they could be Shelly&#39;s.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Forman wouldn&#39;t cheat on Donna.
 <br>
 Sure he would.
 <br>
 Shelly&#39;s a tramp.
 <br>
 No man can turn down a tramp.
 <br>
 Well, let&#39;s find out.
 <br>
 Laurie, have you ever been turned down? Nope.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Sorry, Donna.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t feel sorry for me.
 <br>
 Feel sorry for Eric.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I&#39;m gonna kill him! Will somebody please open the door so I can kill Eric? Hey, there, Red.
 <br>
 Does Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman know you&#39;re out here clogging your arteries with a double cheese? Yes.
 <br>
 So there would be no reason to tell her.
 <br>
 Sorry, Red.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I could lie to Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I really, really love her.
 <br>
 All right, you blackmailing S.
 <br>
 O.
 <br>
 B.
 <br>
 , what do you want? Sure could use some fries.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Now beat it.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to be rude.
 <br>
 What if this wasn&#39;t even the first time? What if there have been other girls? Other panties? Eric, where did these panties come from? Uh, gee, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 But there&#39;s nothing in the dresser.
 <br>
 Nothing at all.
 <br>
 Okay, but at least my closet is panty-free.
 <br>
 Donna, you have my word.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna, please, ignore the rope in the middle of the room.
 <br>
 And whatever you do, don&#39;t Pull it.
 <br>
 ! Eric, how do you exPlain all this? Panties! Glorious panties! [Laughing] Bastard! - Hey, there, Donna.
 <br>
 Where are you going? - To The Hub to kick Eric&#39;s ass! Yeah, well, kick it good.
 <br>
 Jackie, why is Donna gonna beat up Eric? Donna found another woman&#39;s panties in the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 - [Gasps] Oh, no! - I know, right.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s cheating on her.
 <br>
 Jackie, those panties were mine.
 <br>
 You and Eric? No! Me and- Geez, you&#39;re dumb.
 <br>
 Now, remember, we can&#39;t have the protons and electrons right next to each other because that would just be madness.
 <br>
 Madness, I say! Oh, Eric Forman, you are just the funniest person I&#39;ve ever met.
 <br>
 No, I wouldn&#39;t go as- Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I am.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t your girlfriend mind you spending so much time with me? Well, no.
 <br>
 Apparently, she&#39;s thrilled about it.
 <br>
 Well, she&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause if I was your girlfriend, I would want to kiss you all the time.
 <br>
 Really? Whoa! Hey, come on, lady! I&#39;m spoken for! Wow! Hey, did we miss anything? What? God, no.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t miss anything.
 <br>
 All right, people! Let&#39;s back up! Give &#39;em some room here! Hey, Donna, hi, hello.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t &#34;Hey, Donna, hi, hello&#34; me.
 <br>
 I trusted you, and you cheated on me with this slut.
 <br>
 - Uh, Donna, I don&#39;t- - Excuse me? Yeah, I said it.
 <br>
 You want some of this? Come on! - Donna, hey, whatever you think happened- - I know what happened.
 <br>
 - I found these in your car.
 <br>
 - Panties? Aha! So he admits they are panties.
 <br>
 Hey, next time you fool around with someone else&#39;s boyfriend why don&#39;t you take your panties when you&#39;re done? Those aren&#39;t mine.
 <br>
 Mine are white.
 <br>
 And cotton.
 <br>
 With a little pink rose in the front.
 <br>
 So these are some other girl&#39;s panties? Whoa, whoa! No offense, Donna, but, dude, you&#39;re on fire! You know what, Eric? I don&#39;t need this.
 <br>
 Oh, and by the way, your car smells like cheese.
 <br>
 Donna, look, you have to believe me.
 <br>
 I have no idea whose panties those are.
 <br>
 Donna, those panties are mine.
 <br>
 Eric! Ohh! Ohh! You are a god! A god, I say! Um [Clears Throat] Mom why were your panties in the Vista Cruiser? And please be as specific.
 <br>
 Donna, when you&#39;ve been together as long as your father and I have you need to do creative things in creative places.
 <br>
 - Ew! - Ohh! Gads! Psst.
 <br>
 Daddy, here.
 <br>
 Red, you eating again? I thought you&#39;d be full after that burger.
 <br>
 - Burger? - Yeah.
 <br>
 The broccoli burger.
 <br>
 Oh, you are lying! Well, come on, Kitty.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t food.
 <br>
 This is what food eats.
 <br>
 Well, but it&#39;s good for you.
 <br>
 Well, if it&#39;s so good, how come I&#39;m the only one that has to eat it? Good point.
 <br>
 Hey, he&#39;s the food sneaker! - Eat up! - You wanna mess with me again? You just come on back.
 <br>
 - Say it again.
 <br>
 - I already said it.
 <br>
 - Come on, one more time.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re hot.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] - Hot enough to get Shelly? - Hot enough to get Shelly.
 <br>
 - Hot enough to get any girl I want? - Hot enough to get Shelly.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just good stuff.
 <br>
 You know, Eric, you don&#39;t have to rub it in.
 <br>
 I know I made an ass out of myself.
 <br>
 Well, you know what? That&#39;s what you get for taking me for granted.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause, Donna, I may be skinny, but- Yeah, I&#39;m MickJagger skinny and that&#39;s very in right now.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s very hot.
 <br>
 Eric, I know you&#39;re hot, &#39;cause you&#39;re with me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So, what have we learned from all this? - Always lock the doors to the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 - Right you are.
 <br>
 Man, Bob and Midge must really hate me.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause right after having sex in my car, I think they smeared cheese under the seat.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just mean.
 <br>
 There.
 <br>
 Okay, I think it&#39;s safe for human occupancy again.
 <br>
 Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Looks like Bob left something in the car too.
 <br>
 Eric, you must sell this car.
 <br>
 Or call a priest.
 <br>
