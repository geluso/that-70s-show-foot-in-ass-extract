 So, everyone enjoying dinner? - [All Muttering] - Good.
 <br>
 Now, um, I want to talk to everyone about helping me with the church fund-raiser.
 <br>
 Freeze.
 <br>
 Okay, so- [Laughs] God&#39;s Magic Circle is our church&#39;s women&#39;s auxiliary and I volunteered to help organize their next fund-raiser.
 <br>
 And bravo, I say.
 <br>
 Bra vo.
 <br>
 Now, if you&#39;ll please excuse me, I have to attend a meeting.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, uh- It&#39;s very important, so- Okay.
 <br>
 Now, as you all know, um, I&#39;m stuck in a rut.
 <br>
 [Laughs] And, um, I&#39;d really- l-I just need to get out of the house and-and experience new things.
 <br>
 - But, Mom, I think you should- - And I want your support which, by the way, I always give you Mr.
 <br>
 &#34;I want to be a jazz guitarist.
 <br>
 &#34; [Laughing] Eric, if your mother wants you and Archie and Jughead here to help her then you&#39;re going to help her.
 <br>
 - You&#39;reJughead.
 <br>
 - [Scoffs] You&#39;reJughead.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re soJughead, it&#39;s not even debatable.
 <br>
 - You are so- Ow! Steven, stop hitting Jughead.
 <br>
 - See? - Hey.
 <br>
 This is important to her and we should support her for this.
 <br>
 So you guys&#39;ll help out.
 <br>
 Well, thank you, Red.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re coming too.
 <br>
 Oh, no, Kitty.
 <br>
 I, uh- I have a meeting.
 <br>
 With you at church.
 <br>
 - Nice save, Dad.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! No, see, Fez, Bazooka Joe wanted to see time fly so Mort threw the clock out the window.
 <br>
 So time flew.
 <br>
 Get it? Did the clock break? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not really the point.
 <br>
 It&#39;s still a pretty big waste of a clock.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, I gotta go.
 <br>
 - See you later, sweetie.
 <br>
 - See you.
 <br>
 You guys are such a cute couple.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 I really like Caroline.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 She&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 For a psycho.
 <br>
 Hyde, take that back.
 <br>
 [Hissing] Psycho.
 <br>
 You are a gifted mime.
 <br>
 But that hurts.
 <br>
 Hyde, Caroline&#39;s not a psycho.
 <br>
 You just don&#39;t get women.
 <br>
 We have emotions.
 <br>
 We&#39;re ruled by the moon and the tides.
 <br>
 And pretty clothes.
 <br>
 Yeah, we should hang out with her, you know, make her feel welcome.
 <br>
 Yeah, you can never have too many friends.
 <br>
 Sometimes you feel like a nut; sometimes you don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys, you know who was crazy? This camp counselor I once had who used to make everyone do turbo sit-ups.
 <br>
 But he&#39;d put a towel over your face, and then when you went to do the sit-up- He&#39;d pull the towel away, and you&#39;d have to put your face in his butt.
 <br>
 Donna, you stole the funny part.
 <br>
 Well, Eric, I&#39;ve heard it like eight times.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Tell the story again.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll laugh.
 <br>
 But it&#39;ll be fake though, right? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 - Okay, guys, I once had this camp counselor- - [Rumbling] Oh, my God, you guys.
 <br>
 The Petersons just got a new dog.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go! Okay, now, I have work assignments for everyone.
 <br>
 - Red, you&#39;re selling raffle tickets.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m your man.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t yell at the customers.
 <br>
 I&#39;m kinda your man.
 <br>
 - And smile.
 <br>
 - You need another man.
 <br>
 Okay, Michael, Steven, you&#39;re in charge of bingo.
 <br>
 And, Eric, I thought you could run the cakewalk.
 <br>
 Sure.
 <br>
 What&#39;s cakewalk? It&#39;s cake and walking.
 <br>
 What are you, on dope? So, uh, Pastor Dave, what do you think? Gosh, Kitty, I&#39;m impressed.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t remember the last time a God&#39;s Magic Circle fund-raiser looked so gosh darn wonderful.
 <br>
 Hiya, gang.
 <br>
 [Together] Hi, Pastor Dave.
 <br>
 Say, God&#39;s Magic Circle-That sounds like an Eric Clapton song, doesn&#39;t it, kids? [Together] Yes, Pastor Dave.
 <br>
 Rock on, kids.
 <br>
 [Together] Rock on, Pastor Dave.
 <br>
 [&#34;Turkey In The Straw&#34;] Come on, string bean.
 <br>
 Will you stop the record already? Hey, I&#39;m in charge.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll stop it when I&#39;m good and ready.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s not because of you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just &#39;cause I was ready.
 <br>
 Okay, congratulations, Ed.
 <br>
 You win a chocolate cake.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m allergic to chocolate.
 <br>
 Then why are you in the cakewalk, Ed? I thought this was the line for the bathroom.
 <br>
 Now, don&#39;t you screw this up.
 <br>
 I want that marmalade cake.
 <br>
 Sure, yeah, all right, pumpkin.
 <br>
 I was just talking to this guy over here- Oh, just forget it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna screw it up.
 <br>
 You always do.
 <br>
 Just go stand over there.
 <br>
 All right, my turtle dove.
 <br>
 Right over here.
 <br>
 For the love of God, let my wife win the cake.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s in the hands of the Lord now, sir.
 <br>
 Okay, everyone, get ready for another exciting round of cakewalk.
 <br>
 - [Continues] - Would you believe she was once the sweetest most beautiful girl in high school? Of course she was.
 <br>
 A word of advice, kid.
 <br>
 Never marry your high school sweetheart.
 <br>
 Why not? Oh, that&#39;s it, Glen.
 <br>
 Just keep slouching.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re not mousy enough.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s why.
 <br>
 - [Laughing, Cheering] - [Man] Hot as a Pistol.
 <br>
 ! Boy, did I take thesejerks to the cleaners.
 <br>
 ! Hey! That&#39;s a craps table.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Except here it&#39;s called &#34;cripes.
 <br>
 &#34; Would you like to be the next holy roller? Are you kidding? Next to prayer, craps is my favorite thing about church.
 <br>
 Well, enjoy yourself.
 <br>
 I gotta go check out the Last Supper bake sale.
 <br>
 Free cupcakes for anyone who doesn&#39;t deny the Lord! We gotta win the Rock&#39;em Sock&#39;em Robots.
 <br>
 These are the most technologically advanced of all the plastic, spring-loaded boxing robots.
 <br>
 Who knows? Maybe we&#39;ll get lucky.
 <br>
 Or we could cheat.
 <br>
 Kelso, man, you&#39;re willing to cheat? Here in the house of the Lord? You&#39;re coming along nicely.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s not that bad.
 <br>
 Because technically we&#39;re only in the basement of the Lord.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll bet he never comes down here.
 <br>
 Yeah, good point.
 <br>
 Plus what old lady wants Rock&#39;em Sock&#39;em Robots or a box of Pop Rocks or a SuperBall? Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, they could hurt themselves.
 <br>
 You give the elderly Pop Rocks, and they could get all foamy and stroke out.
 <br>
 - So we&#39;re helping.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re helping.
 <br>
 B-7.
 <br>
 Bingo! [Laughs] Gosh, that&#39;s lucky.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s Donna.
 <br>
 - Oh, look at that.
 <br>
 A carrot top, huh? Ah, that&#39;s great, kid.
 <br>
 Just great.
 <br>
 You know, I was a lot like you- a milky-white loser with a cheap haircut and less muscle tone than a canned ham.
 <br>
 Okay, first of all, Glen I&#39;m wiry, okay? Yeah, I was dating the hottest looking girl in the school.
 <br>
 Thought I had it made.
 <br>
 - So what happened? - I don&#39;t know really.
 <br>
 One day we just realized that she had heard all of my stories and I had heard all of her stories and, well, that&#39;s when she stopped being nice and started eating.
 <br>
 Oh, God, Donna eats.
 <br>
 Better watch it there, kid.
 <br>
 It starts small.
 <br>
 A few wise-ass comments, and then they&#39;re puttin&#39; you down in front of your friends.
 <br>
 Donna, you stole the funny part.
 <br>
 Well, Eric, I&#39;ve heard it like eight times.
 <br>
 Then before you know it, you&#39;re praying for death.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Either hers or yours.
 <br>
 Either way, at least it&#39;s quiet.
 <br>
 You really brought me down, man.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] Yeah, I do that.
 <br>
 You guys are so much fun to hang out with.
 <br>
 We really are.
 <br>
 So what does Cosmo say about me? I&#39;m a Gemini.
 <br>
 Um, okay, the twins.
 <br>
 Two people trapped in one body.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re like a split personality.
 <br>
 If you ever say that again, I&#39;ll kill you.
 <br>
 [Laughing] I&#39;m kidding.
 <br>
 You guys, I&#39;m psycho, remember? Whoo-hoo! Wow, that was- that was really good.
 <br>
 I almost wet myself.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Enough small talk.
 <br>
 - So, is Fez, like, an amazing kisser? - Jackie, don&#39;t make me blush.
 <br>
 No, she&#39;s only asking because when she kissed him, he did this thing with his tongue.
 <br>
 - You kissed Fez? - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 It was so nothing.
 <br>
 He had this stupid crush on me.
 <br>
 [Screaming] Shut up! [Panting] If either of you ever touch my boyfriend I will hunt you down like animals.
 <br>
 Understand? [Laughing] [Laughing] You&#39;re kidding, right? [Laughs] You&#39;re kidding, right! I&#39;ll scratch your big, dumb eyes out! Got it? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Her nails are beautiful.
 <br>
 I just wanted to thank you once again for doing such a wonderful job, Kitty.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ll tell you, Pastor Dave it feels so good to get out of the house and do something important.
 <br>
 You know who else got out of the house and did something important? Jesus.
 <br>
 And lucky for us he did.
 <br>
 Are you all right? Well, I ran out of underwear, and I&#39;m wearing my swimsuit, and, uh- I&#39;ve said too much.
 <br>
 [&#34;Turkey In The Straw&#34;] Eric? [Men Shouting] I&#39;m the richest man in church! Fellas, these dice like me.
 <br>
 Whoa! Oh, yeah! B-l-N-G-O! And that spells losers.
 <br>
 Losers.
 <br>
 Damn it! [Glen&#39;s Voice] Never marry your high school sweetheart.
 <br>
 [Voice Echoing] [Coughing] - Oh, hey, did I tell you- - Heard it! Who ate the last doughnut? I did.
 <br>
 Son of a bitch.
 <br>
 You ate the first 11! Oh, shut up! [Coughing] No, I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 I weigh 80 pounds.
 <br>
 Look at you! Do you know why I&#39;m bald? My body is eating its own hair! - Hey! - Hey! Hey, Diamond Jim, come here.
 <br>
 How&#39;s the abandoned raffle going? Kitty, I&#39;m on fire.
 <br>
 I just rolled four hard eights in a row! God is bending the laws of probability just for me.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 We won everything.
 <br>
 Yeah, we&#39;re just supernaturally lucky.
 <br>
 Hey, Mom, I got some bad, bad news for you.
 <br>
 For every one doughnut I get, Donna gets 11.
 <br>
 Storm&#39;s a-brewin&#39;.
 <br>
 Eric, how could you leave the cakewalk? Just look at those people.
 <br>
 - Kitty, how&#39;s everything going? - Just great.
 <br>
 Everything&#39;s great.
 <br>
 You kids buy a raffle ticket? Third prize is a rock and roll record.
 <br>
 John Denver&#39;s Greatest Hits.
 <br>
 He fills up your senses.
 <br>
 I ask for one day of help, and this is what I get? Um, yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, wonderful.
 <br>
 I started out in-in God&#39;s Magic Circle and ended up in Satan&#39;s Evil Square.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe any of you can walk into a church without bursting into flames.
 <br>
 - Kitty, we&#39;re- - Okay, you know what? Just forget it.
 <br>
 Just go.
 <br>
 And please leave your ill-gotten gains.
 <br>
 I won them.
 <br>
 They&#39;re mine.
 <br>
 - Hi, Mom.
 <br>
 We&#39;re sorry.
 <br>
 - Very sorry.
 <br>
 - Welcome home.
 <br>
 - I love you so much.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? Just stop.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not mad at you.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re not? No.
 <br>
 On my way home, while dreaming about being married to someone else and having his children I, um- I realized that this is all my fault.
 <br>
 All right! Hold on.
 <br>
 This may be a trap.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I shouldn&#39;t have forced you to come with me when what I really wanted was just- just to do something for myself.
 <br>
 Look, Kitty, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 And if there&#39;s anything that you wanna do from now on you should go and do it if it makes you happy.
 <br>
 And we&#39;ll support you by not going with you.
 <br>
 Would that be good? Yes.
 <br>
 Thank you, Red.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You and Mom.
 <br>
 You were-You were fighting, and then you just made up.
 <br>
 And you guys have been married for like a million years.
 <br>
 It fills my heart with hope.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going in the army.
 <br>
 She was scary.
 <br>
 Really scary.
 <br>
 Okay, Exorcist scary.
 <br>
 Fez, you have to break up with her.
 <br>
 Okay, you two are overreacting.
 <br>
 She is a little loony, but she wouldn&#39;t hurt you.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hello, my sweet girlfriend.
 <br>
 [Grunts] We&#39;ve been over this! Caroline! Touch Fez and die! - Stop it! These are my friends! - Oh, really? Did they shoplift 30 dollars&#39; worth of indelible ink markers and write your name on every inch of their room? [Stamping Foot] Every inch! Did they? Um, did you guys do that? - No.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Well, there you have it.
 <br>
 Um, Caroline, I have to break up with you.
 <br>
 Why? And don&#39;t say it&#39;s because I&#39;m crazy.
 <br>
 Because I&#39;m not crazy.
 <br>
 Oh, no.
 <br>
 Oh- Oh, no.
 <br>
 Of cour- Of course not.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, um- It&#39;s just, um- - Donna and I are in love.
 <br>
 - What? - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 - Ewww! Yes, we are freaky for each other.
 <br>
 Please tell her.
 <br>
 Please.
 <br>
 [Quietly] What if she tries to kill me? You&#39;re a giant.
 <br>
 You can take her.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You&#39;re really breaking up with me? Is that okay? Fez, I just want to say that you will never be as happy as you were with me! Ever.
 <br>
 And until you realize that, I&#39;ll be seeing you.
 <br>
 And by &#34;I&#39;ll be seeing you,&#34; I mean that I&#39;ll be watching you.
 <br>
 But you won&#39;t know it.
 <br>
 Except I just told you, so you do know it.
 <br>
 Anyway, this isn&#39;t over! Whew.
 <br>
 Sure am glad that&#39;s over.
 <br>
 One, two, three, go! Damn it.
 <br>
 Damn it.
 <br>
 All right, mine&#39;s broken.
 <br>
 Did- Robots are stupid.
 <br>
