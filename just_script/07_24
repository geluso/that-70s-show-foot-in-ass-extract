<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Good morning, mr.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Charlie ! Didn&#39;t recognize you without your schoolgirl skirt.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you go drink another warehouse full of beer ? And then you can get out of those uncomfortable boy things.
 <br>
 Man, I really got off on the wrong foot with your dad.
 <br>
 Ah, it&#39;ll blow over.
 <br>
 How long could he stay mad at a kid, right ? You know what ? Later on, I&#39;m gonna find him and apologize.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll understand.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, if you&#39;re lookin&#39; for a good conversation starter, just say we were probably wrong to go into vietnam.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your breakfast, charlie.
 <br>
 Oh, eric, I didn&#39;t realize you still lived here.
 <br>
 I thought you left for africa.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;ve been sitting here for, like, ten minutes.
 <br>
 Then you&#39;d better get going, or you&#39;re gonna be late for africa.
 <br>
 Okay, I get it, mom.
 <br>
 You&#39;re trying to make me feel bad about leaving.
 <br>
 Oh, are you still here ? I thought you were in africa.
 <br>
 Hyde, have you heard anything from jackie ? Nope.
 <br>
 That&#39;s fine by me, man.
 <br>
 Who does she think she is, giving me an ultimatum &#34;marry me or I&#39;m moving to chicago&#34; ? Then she takes off before I even give her an answer.
 <br>
 Well, what&#39;s the big deal, man ? She let you off the hook.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You were gonna say no anyway, unless oh, my god ! You were gonna say yes ! No.
 <br>
 What ? No.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 You were gonna marry her.
 <br>
 You were gonna marry her because you love her.
 <br>
 hey, jackie, you&#39;re everything this poor little orphan boy ever needed.
 <br>
 - oh, my god ! I really am.
 <br>
 - Oh, my god ! Hey, I don&#39;t love her.
 <br>
 You know what love is ? Love is for losers who are too afraid to be alone.
 <br>
 Uh, no, you&#39;re thinking of kittens.
 <br>
 So I gotta go.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go wrap your going-away present.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re the one going away.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t have to get me anything.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I knew you were gonna get me something.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t want this to be awkward again like, you know, christmas.
 <br>
 Well, I did get you something.
 <br>
 Oh, crap, I didn&#39;t get him anything ! He leaves in three days.
 <br>
 Oh, well, why don&#39;t you just get him an ultimatum ? It&#39;s free.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to wrap it.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll totally make him wish he was dead.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s between that or one of those shirts that makes him look all muscley.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episodes 24 et 25 &#34;Short And Curlies&#34; - &#34;Til The Next Goodbye&#34; Look at the blanket I got for our new apartment.
 <br>
 I found it in a dumpster.
 <br>
 It&#39;s got lots of stains, so it goes with everything.
 <br>
 That is so awesome.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not even gonna ask what you were doing in the dumpster.
 <br>
 Is steven here ? No, he went to work.
 <br>
 Oh, but before he left, he was chucking everything you ever gave him all around the basement.
 <br>
 It was like a hailstorm of stuffed animals and abba records.
 <br>
 Wait, what are you doing here anyway? I thought you left for chicago.
 <br>
 I would have, but my mom took the car to tijuana and won&#39;t be back till cinco de mayo, whenever that is.
 <br>
 So until then, I need you guys to help me avoid the horrors of seeing steven till I can figure out a way to get out of here.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s too bad, &#39;cause I think I hear him coming down the stairs now.
 <br>
 Oh, my god.
 <br>
 What do I do ? Okay, um Quick, get down under the blanket ! He&#39;s not coming down.
 <br>
 I made the whole thing up, and now you&#39;re under a stinky blanket ! The stinky blanket burn ! That is awesome ! Oh, that is disgusting.
 <br>
 Oh, this blanket smells like dog.
 <br>
 That&#39;s because when I found it, it was wrapped around a dead dog.
 <br>
 Uh-oh, jackie.
 <br>
 He&#39;s coming for real this time.
 <br>
 Get down ! Oh, my god ! - I got her ! - I got her ! I am gonna kick you both in the nads.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna have to do it later, because here he comes now.
 <br>
 Oh, well, now I don&#39;t believe you.
 <br>
 Okay, then.
 <br>
 Hey, come on in.
 <br>
 Good to see you, hyde.
 <br>
 What&#39;s going on, buddy ? she  did it again ! I got the best going-away present for eric.
 <br>
 Okay a pen and pencil set.
 <br>
 That way he can write me every day.
 <br>
 Well, isn&#39;t that just d onna, a going-away gift should be something special, meaningful, personal.
 <br>
 Okay, like what clock radio ? Underwear ? Some spoons ? Help me.
 <br>
 No, honey, like okay.
 <br>
 Before red went to korea, I had my sister take a sexy boudoir photograph of me.
 <br>
 I was wearing nothing but a fur coat.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, you bad, bad girl.
 <br>
 It was racy.
 <br>
 You could see my knees.
 <br>
 Oh ! So I gotta go over to donna&#39;s, get my going-away present.
 <br>
 Man, she is, like, the world&#39;s worst gift giver.
 <br>
 Remember that ugly sweater vest and that huge man ring ? Now I gotta go get excited about some other lame thing.
 <br>
 &#34;Oh, wow, donna, clown shoes.
 <br>
 Thank you so much.
 <br>
 &#34; I wish I had a beautiful girl give me clown shoes.
 <br>
 Hell, I&#39;d settle for a beautiful clown giving me girl shoes.
 <br>
 I dated a clown once.
 <br>
 But soon as I learned how to make those balloon animals, I dumped her.
 <br>
 Excuse me, mr.
 <br>
 Forman oh ! Ohh ! What the hell ? Well, that was exciting.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, I was looking for you to apologize about the dress thing, okay ? But then I opened the door, and wow ! No, I don&#39;t mean &#34;wow.
 <br>
 &#34; I mean, &#34;oh, no !&#34; No, no, I don&#39;t mean, &#34;oh, no.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, what were you doing just standing there ? I was like a deer caught in the headlights.
 <br>
 Oh ! I said, &#34;headlights.
 <br>
 &#34; Red, it was a very awkward situation.
 <br>
 No one knew what to do.
 <br>
 Well, I know what I would do if I saw you naked.
 <br>
 I&#39;d turn and run the other way.
 <br>
 Oh, I look, damn it, he&#39;s the one in trouble here, not me.
 <br>
 Hey, kitty, could I have some peanut oil ? I&#39;m gonna fry up some jumbo shrimp, which is a funny name.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like calling someone a giant midget.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like to see one of those.
 <br>
 Get this, Charlie here walked into our bedroom and saw kitty naked.
 <br>
 Whoo-hoo ! How was that ? Well, how do you think it was ? It was horrifying.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 So, mr.
 <br>
 Forman, how wrong was it for us to get into vietnam, huh ? uh-oh, jackie.
 <br>
 Hyde&#39;s coming for real this time.
 <br>
 Quick, drink this old root beer.
 <br>
 You know what ? I am so tired of you two lying about steven just so you can humiliate me.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 Let me make it up to you by offering you this different, not-old root beer.
 <br>
 Jackie, hyde is coming right now.
 <br>
 You know what, michael ? I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not playing your little game anymore.
 <br>
 Jackie.
 <br>
 Why aren&#39;t you in chicago ? Why do you smell like a dead dog ? Okay, donna, I&#39;m ready for my going-away present.
 <br>
 Yahoo.
 <br>
 All right, here I come.
 <br>
 Holy mother of skywalker.
 <br>
 You can do whatever you want to princess leia.
 <br>
 Her force field is down.
 <br>
 Donna, this is the best wait a second.
 <br>
 Leia doesn&#39;t have a force field.
 <br>
 You know what ? I&#39;m too excited to quibble.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 I thought you left town.
 <br>
 Why ? Because you&#39;re so amazing and incredible that I simply couldn&#39;t exist in the same town as you knowing you couldn&#39;t make a commitment ? No, because you wrote me a note saying that you left town.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Want me to cover you up with the stinky blanket ? Would you guys get lost ? Oh, you want your privacy.
 <br>
 I understand.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just gonna go upstairs and listen through the vent.
 <br>
 So what are you doing here, jackie ? You got something you wanna say to me? Yes, I want to say that I&#39;m leaving for real this time.
 <br>
 So you came back to tell me that you&#39;re leaving again.
 <br>
 Yes, but this is good-bye.
 <br>
 All right, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow then.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;m serious.
 <br>
 So want to hang out next week ? I&#39;m going.
 <br>
 Unless unless, steven, there&#39;s something you&#39;d like to say, in which case, I&#39;m listening.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Have  a good trip.
 <br>
 I will.
 <br>
 can you guys stand closer to the vent and talk louder ? Wow, so, uh, it&#39;s like, I can do anything I want ? Can I touch your buns ? What,  you want to touch my butt ? No, not not those buns.
 <br>
 You know the buns.
 <br>
 Eric, that seems kind of weird.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You know what ? That is, like, a little weird.
 <br>
 Maybe I&#39;ll just rub my face up against one of &#39;em.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Leia oh, leia donna, meet me downstairs for fried shrimp in t-minus 20 seconds.
 <br>
 Wear an old shirt.
 <br>
 These things are greasy.
 <br>
 Wow, that&#39;s almost enough to take you right out of the moment, huh ? Um, okay, donna.
 <br>
 From now on, the only thing I&#39;d like you to say is, &#34;use the force, eric.
 <br>
 &#34; - Okay, that seems kind of - donna.
 <br>
 Use the force, eric.
 <br>
 Man, and now mr.
 <br>
 Forman is even madder at me since I saw mrs.
 <br>
 Forman naked.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t he know I went to catholic school ? I don&#39;t even know what any of that stuff is.
 <br>
 Now what exactly did you see ? And I&#39;m only asking because I find miss kitty attractive in a sexual way.
 <br>
 I know how you can get back on red&#39;s good side walk in on him naked.
 <br>
 No way, man.
 <br>
 I do know what that stuff is, and I don&#39;t want to see it.
 <br>
 Seriously, look, it&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 Look, red assumes that everyone is either a pervert or an idiot.
 <br>
 - He thinks I&#39;m both.
 <br>
 - He thinks I&#39;m both.
 <br>
 See, and if you walk in on red naked, he&#39;s gonna assume that you&#39;re the biggest idiot in the world.
 <br>
 That kind of makes sense.
 <br>
 You know, you probably hear this all the time, but you&#39;re really smart.
 <br>
 Hey, jackie, how&#39;d it go with hyde ? Did he ask you to stay ? No.
 <br>
 But even if he did, I can&#39;t stay, because I&#39;ve got a career waiting for me in chicago.
 <br>
 But I am stuck here in this stupid place with no way out.
 <br>
 Jackie, you know what would help ? If you eat this dirty milk dud.
 <br>
 Shut up, fez.
 <br>
 Jackie, I&#39;m here for you, okay ? So I&#39;ll even give you a ride.
 <br>
 Really ? Oh, michael, that would be great.
 <br>
 And I won&#39;t do anything, because frankly, I don&#39;t have much to offer.
 <br>
 You guys smell smoke ? Everyone out of the house ! I used too much oil in the fry baby.
 <br>
 The whole kitchen&#39;s filled with smoke.
 <br>
 Bob ? Bob, are you okay ? Yeah, I&#39;m fine, but my shrimp are ruined.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna have to eat with you guys.
 <br>
 fire ! Fire ! What the hell is on your head ? I&#39;m still wearing the helmet, aren&#39;t I ? What did you do to my daughter ? Nothing.
 <br>
 I was a perfect gentleman.
 <br>
 I just squeezed her buns.
 <br>
 I smell like smoke from bob&#39;s damn fire.
 <br>
 If  kitty&#39;s looking for me, I went upstairs to take a shower.
 <br>
 Now&#39;s your chance to catch red naked.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s gonna think I&#39;m such an idiot! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Give him enough time to take everything off.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t want to walk in on him wearing nothing but socks.
 <br>
 That would just make this whole thing weird.
 <br>
 Oh, boy.
 <br>
 Get back here, you pervert ! That boy just can&#39;t get enough of me.
 <br>
 Sorry my present didn&#39;t work out.
 <br>
 Well I mean, we are alone now.
 <br>
 And, uh, I think I know exactly what might get you back in the mood a little romantic music.
 <br>
 where were we ? Oh, yes, you were a prisoner aboard the death star.
 <br>
 And I am the only stormtrooper with the keys to your laser chastity belt.
 <br>
 That&#39;s in the movie ? Donna, it&#39;s implicit.
 <br>
 God, I&#39;m gonna miss you, eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 What was that ? use the force, eric.
 <br>
 All right, here we are.
 <br>
 Good luck in chicago.
 <br>
 Uh, michael, this is the bus station.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I said I&#39;d give you a ride, and then under my breath I whispered, &#34;to the bus station.
 <br>
 &#34; No, no, no.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t ride the bus.
 <br>
 Other people&#39;s butts have been on those seats.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m not driving you all the way there.
 <br>
 That&#39;s, like, two hours away.
 <br>
 Michael, you put this car in gear and take me to chicago right now.
 <br>
 You know what ? You haven&#39;t changed at all.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still just a spoiled little princess who gets by on her good looks and bitchy demands and mean and painful pinches.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you still don&#39;t have any manners.
 <br>
 A real man wouldn&#39;t let the princess ride the bus.
 <br>
 Well, you know what ? You&#39;re not even a princess.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just a little bossy boss ! That&#39;s right, michael.
 <br>
 I&#39;m the boss, and you&#39;re taking the boss to chicago right now.
 <br>
 Ow ! Fine ! You&#39;re always telling me what to do.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve missed this.
 <br>
 please, mr.
 <br>
 Stormtrooper, I&#39;ll do anything you want if you only spare the planet alderaan.
 <br>
 Eric, you have a line.
 <br>
 We rehearsed this.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Fez ! But I just want to touch the buns.
 <br>
 Let me touch the buns.
 <br>
 <br>
