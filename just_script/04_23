 Any good mail? Well, we got the new Yarn Barn catalog.
 <br>
 And the model is showing cleavage? You know, if I want that in my house, I will watch McMillan and Wife.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven got a letter from Department of Motor Vehicles.
 <br>
 What? Another damn ticket? Hey, screw-head! Why is the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 sending you letters? - ( Chuckles ) Screw-head.
 <br>
 Hey, screw-head.
 <br>
 - ( Slaps Butt ) No, no, no.
 <br>
 You&#39;re screw-head.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just called &#39;&#39;boy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I got a letter from the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 ? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about the cow.
 <br>
 Did I say &#39;&#39;cow&#39;&#39;? Because what I meant was countdown- countdown to better driving.
 <br>
 I think what Eric&#39;s trying to say is, he hit a cow.
 <br>
 Wait- Well, I had the right-of-way! Go ahead.
 <br>
 Open it, hot rod.
 <br>
 You know, you are the most irresponsible careless, no-account, undisc- Oh, it&#39;s a license renewal for my 1 8th birthday.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Happy birthday! ( Chuckles ) Guess who gets 1 8 hugs the day before his 1 8th birthday? One, two- Everyone! - ( All ) Three, four, five- - Okay.
 <br>
 - six, seven, eight- - Okay.
 <br>
 All right, all right! Thanks, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, but you can drop it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not really into birthdays, especially this one.
 <br>
 - Oh, no, you don&#39;t! Nine, ten- - Get off me, spaz! Oh, Steven likes birthdays.
 <br>
 He just doesn&#39;t know it.
 <br>
 Which is why we&#39;re throwing him a surprise party.
 <br>
 Now, I need two helpers with keen feminine sensibilities to help decorate.
 <br>
 Jackie and Fez.
 <br>
 Yea.
 <br>
 What the hell? I&#39;m feminine.
 <br>
 I should kick her ass for that.
 <br>
 Hey,Jackie, while you&#39;re up there, try not to kiss any more guys! Man, are you guys still fighting about that? You gotta come down hard on stuff like this.
 <br>
 If she&#39;d have come down harder on me when I was cheating, I would&#39;ve- Well, I would have been way sneakier about it.
 <br>
 You know what, you guys? Eighteen is a big deal.
 <br>
 We ought to get Hyde, like, the perfect Hyde gift.
 <br>
 So, you know what? Let&#39;s try to put ourselves in a total Hyde state of mind.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, now, what would Hyde want? Something stolen.
 <br>
 Stolen&#39;s good.
 <br>
 But you know what&#39;s better? - ( Snaps Fingers ) - Stolen and dirty! So what&#39;s a good gift for Hyde that&#39;s stolen and dirty? Someone else&#39;s pig! No, no, wait! I got it! I got it! A street sign.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll steal it, so it&#39;ll be stolen and it&#39;s dirty, so it&#39;ll be dirty.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Kelso just solved his first word problem.
 <br>
 Ohh! Yeah, I learned those in Miss Carter&#39;s class &#39;cause I knew if I got one right that&#39;d she&#39;d give me a hug.
 <br>
 No bra and they were always pointy.
 <br>
 Now, that&#39;s good teachin&#39;.
 <br>
 No problem.
 <br>
 You can have Hyde&#39;s party here.
 <br>
 There&#39;s only one thing I ask.
 <br>
 Can I come? The party&#39;s at your house, Bob.
 <br>
 Of course you&#39;re invited.
 <br>
 Oh, boy, I&#39;m in! I&#39;ll get my Anne Murray albums! Okay, now, you two.
 <br>
 I want this party to look nice.
 <br>
 So, um, balloons, streamers- whatever makes Steven forget he has no parents.
 <br>
 So, Fez, how do you want to decorate this place? - Well, what I&#39;m thinking- - No, no, no.
 <br>
 I want Arabian Nights- veils, Persian rugs.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 One question,Jackie.
 <br>
 Is this a party for Hyde, or a bunch of whores in a whorehouse? Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Check it out! &#39;&#39;High Street.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, man.
 <br>
 Hyde&#39;s gonna love this.
 <br>
 - Here, Donna, I&#39;ll give you a boost.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 One, two, three.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah! Fingers! - Oh! - Come on, Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll give you a boost.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 Why not? Because you&#39;ll throw me.
 <br>
 What? No, I won&#39;t! ( Chuckles ) Yeah, I will.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 How about we stand on top of the van and reach it? I think not! We&#39;ll dent the roof.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want nothin&#39; to happen to the &#39;&#39;love bus.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Okay, I got it.
 <br>
 I got a better idea.
 <br>
 Okay,just make sure it&#39;s tight.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Okay, you&#39;re good to go.
 <br>
 Well, at least the roof s okay.
 <br>
 Steven! I thought you were at work.
 <br>
 Not till later.
 <br>
 Why are you baking so many cupcakes? I had four dozen eggs.
 <br>
 They were gonna go bad.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I don&#39;t want a party.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m not saying that because I&#39;m fishing for a party.
 <br>
 I mean, I don&#39;t want a party.
 <br>
 - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 - &#39;Cause I know how this family works.
 <br>
 You guys say you don&#39;t want stuff that you actually want.
 <br>
 Like on Mother&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 You said you didn&#39;t want a fuss.
 <br>
 But you did want a fuss.
 <br>
 So we made a fuss, and you were happy? That can drive a guy nuts.
 <br>
 It really can.
 <br>
 So now, I don&#39;t know what to do or say or not say because I really don&#39;t want a party.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t wanna do anything you don&#39;t want.
 <br>
 See, I don&#39;t know what that means! Well, it means there&#39;s no party.
 <br>
 Oh, please.
 <br>
 Would I lie to you about making you a party? I am hurt.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 - You lied.
 <br>
 - No, no.
 <br>
 I said, &#39;&#39;Would I lie?&#39;&#39; It was very tricky.
 <br>
 I was like Houdini, but with words.
 <br>
 The base of the sign&#39;s all cracked.
 <br>
 So all we have to do is shove this firecracker in there, and blammo! The sign comes down.
 <br>
 Wow, it could actually work if the base were made of pudding! If the base were made of pudding, Eric we could just pull the sign right out.
 <br>
 ( Singsong Voice ) Okay, get ready to run! Huh.
 <br>
 Must be a dud.
 <br>
 Go find out.
 <br>
 - Why me? - &#39;Cause you&#39;re super skinny.
 <br>
 If it blows up, you got the best chance of having stuff not hit you.
 <br>
 True, but on the other hand no one would be surprised if you blew yourself up.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good point.
 <br>
 Oh,just move.
 <br>
 Here, you big babies.
 <br>
 Okay, what you just did, just there? That was so hot.
 <br>
 I&#39;d follow your fine behind into combat any day.
 <br>
 All right, look.
 <br>
 If we got Red&#39;s tools, I bet I could cut down that pole.
 <br>
 Casey showed me how to saw through rebar.
 <br>
 Our second date.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I love those stories.
 <br>
 Hey, I&#39;ll just sneak into your garage, grab the tools.
 <br>
 Red&#39;ll never know.
 <br>
 Okay, but you gotta be really quiet.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 It&#39;s me we&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 I&#39;m like a cat.
 <br>
 ( Sighs ) ( Clears Throat ) ( Gasps ) Red.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re wonderin&#39; why I&#39;m goin&#39; through your stuff.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s- See, I needed, uh, to borrow your saw because I need to chop down a tree.
 <br>
 Because there&#39;s something stuck in it.
 <br>
 An animal.
 <br>
 A rabbit.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a rabbit stuck in a tree.
 <br>
 And I want to return that rabbit to the wild so it can lay its eggs.
 <br>
 Kelso, rabbits don&#39;t- How the hell did a rabbit get up a tree? Uh, Eric threw it up there.
 <br>
 Eric threw a rabbit up a tree? Yeah.
 <br>
 He&#39;s a sadistic bastard.
 <br>
 You know he hit a cow? You know, you&#39;ve been in a bad mood all night, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna cheer you up.
 <br>
 Ah, boo! Ah, boo! ( Blathering ) Aw, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, uh, I can work tomorrow night if you want me to.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not working tomorrow, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s your birthday.
 <br>
 Yeah, man, my 1 8th birthday.
 <br>
 Otherwise known as the beginning of the end.
 <br>
 The black hole, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the death march.
 <br>
 Look, if there&#39;s a war, I could get drafted.
 <br>
 If there&#39;s a war, I&#39;ll see you in Canada.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s not the point, Leo.
 <br>
 I mean, there&#39;s other stuff too, you know.
 <br>
 Hey, don&#39;t get snippy with me, man.
 <br>
 Hyde, we need you to settle an argument.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure you know by now that we&#39;re throwing you a party.
 <br>
 What party? Okay, I&#39;m sure you know by now that we&#39;re throwing you a party.
 <br>
 So, what kind of theme would you like? Throw whatever party you want, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna be there.
 <br>
 Well, if that&#39;s his attitude, I don&#39;t wanna do anything.
 <br>
 I quit.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t quit on me.
 <br>
 I quit on you you bossy little midget.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t even.
 <br>
 - What the hell? - No! No! Excuse me, little boy with glasses.
 <br>
 That&#39;s our sign.
 <br>
 Um, excuse me, big dork with Farrah hair.
 <br>
 No, it isn&#39;t.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Farrah hair&#39;&#39;? If I look like any of the Charlie&#39;s Angels, it&#39;s Jaclyn Smith! Wow, that&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Hey, there, little fella.
 <br>
 What if I told you that I had $20 for a special someone if they gave us the sign? - Nope.
 <br>
 - A month&#39;s supply of candy? - Nope.
 <br>
 - What if I show you my bra strap? Okay.
 <br>
 ( Kelso, Eric ) Okay! Here.
 <br>
 I bet if I showed him my whole bra, he would have given me his bike.
 <br>
 These things are awesome.
 <br>
 That was hot.
 <br>
 Man, why is she so hot today? &#39;Cause you can&#39;t have her, &#39;cause you lost her, &#39;cause you&#39;re stupid.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Um,Jackie cheated on you, right, with a little, tiny cheese guy? Hey! Truce, okay? - Yeah, I think that&#39;s best.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey, if you hadn&#39;t blown it with Donna -you&#39;d probably be doin&#39; it with her right now.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckles ) Yeah.
 <br>
 ! You know who&#39;s probably doin&#39; it? Jackie, with the cheese guy.
 <br>
 We had a truce! Wow.
 <br>
 Yeah, this place looks great.
 <br>
 Fez,Jackie, the decorations are beautiful.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 They haven&#39;t been here all day.
 <br>
 I did this because I&#39;m feminine too.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a lady.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t anyone freakin&#39; see that? Oh, honey, no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 Okay, the next time I need a feminine touch, I am using you and Fez.
 <br>
 What happened to those cupcakes? Bob, there were a dozen cupcakes there.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Red.
 <br>
 They&#39;re like vitamins to me.
 <br>
 Hey, you guys.
 <br>
 Bad news.
 <br>
 Hyde said he&#39;s not coming.
 <br>
 He&#39;s just sitting in the basement.
 <br>
 Oh, but it&#39;s his birthday.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t be alone on his birthday.
 <br>
 Red? I agree.
 <br>
 Eric, you go home and sit with Steven.
 <br>
 Oh, okay, fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get him.
 <br>
 Surprise! ( Chuckles ) We got him, dudes.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Get your butt up those stairs and over to your party.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not goin&#39;.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re 1 8 now.
 <br>
 It&#39;s time to start being a man.
 <br>
 And the first rule to being a man is you gotta spend your life doing crap you don&#39;t wanna do.
 <br>
 Like right now, I don&#39;t wanna be here talkin&#39; to you but I am.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t wanna go to a party but you will.
 <br>
 Actually, I won&#39;t.
 <br>
 ( Mockingly Sympathetic ) What&#39;s the matter? You don&#39;t like parties? Me neither.
 <br>
 But as long as you&#39;re livin&#39; under my roof you&#39;ll do what I tell you to do.
 <br>
 Well, lucky for me, I won&#39;t be under your roof much longer anyway.
 <br>
 What the hell you talkin&#39; about? Well, I&#39;m 1 8.
 <br>
 I should be getting out of here, right? I mean, that&#39;s what my dad did and my uncle did and my cousins did.
 <br>
 They were all on their own when they were my age.
 <br>
 What are they doin&#39; now? Uh, pumping gas, prison, prison, dead, prison.
 <br>
 And the reason you&#39;re living here is so you don&#39;t end up like them.
 <br>
 But if you want to leave, I can&#39;t stop you.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s it gonna be, Steven? Prison, death or a birthday party? I guess I&#39;ll go to the party.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Thanks, Red.
 <br>
 You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 And, uh don&#39;t tell Eric that we had this little conversation.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause when he&#39;s 1 8, he&#39;s out.
 <br>
 So, punch.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Oh, fine.
 <br>
 Everybody, they&#39;re here! They&#39;re- Shh! Shh! ( All ) Surprise! You got me, dudes.
 <br>
 Wow, thanks.
 <br>
 Oh, happy birthday.
 <br>
 Damn,Jackie! Stop kissing other guys! ( Humming Fanfare ) Wow, this is great.
 <br>
 Did you get this at the flea market? - The flea market? - Yeah, they sell &#39;em there for two bucks.
 <br>
 No, we stole it.
 <br>
 It took forever.
 <br>
 I had to show my bra! You owe me a bumper! Now, I made this for you.
 <br>
 See? It says &#39;&#39;Steven&#39;&#39; on the front because I heard that having your name on your clothes is cool.
 <br>
 Plus, if anybody finds it, they can return it to you.
 <br>
 So, I won&#39;t be able to lose it.
 <br>
 - Great.
 <br>
 - ( Laughing ) Put it on.
 <br>
 Do I have to? You bet your ass.
 <br>
 Welcome to manhood.
 <br>
 ( Chuckling ) Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman I&#39;m not really a pinata kind of guy.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Steven.
 <br>
 Everyone plays pinata.
 <br>
 Yeah, Steven.
 <br>
 Hit the jackass! Ow! Hey! Steven!Just listen-
 <br>
