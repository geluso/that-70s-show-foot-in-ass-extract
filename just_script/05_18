<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 So, Hyde, big job fair tomorrow.
 <br>
 Oh, and you&#39;re in luck, &#39;cause I read that corporate America is experiencing a severe shortage of paranoid conspiracy nuts.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not a conspiracy nut, okay? My history, shop and gym teachers secretly started that rumor to discredit me.
 <br>
 I do need a job though since the Fotohut shut down.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m never gonna get my pictures back, which is a real shame &#39;cause they&#39;ll never let me under the bleachers anymore.
 <br>
 You need a job too, Eric since you just got fired from your last job by your own daddy.
 <br>
 Well, at least my daddy&#39;s not in jail for bribery.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So get this.
 <br>
 The radio station I work at wants me to work their job-fair booth as &#34;Hot Donna.
 <br>
 &#34; All right? As if I&#39;m some object for guys to leer at.
 <br>
 God.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God! Spank me! - Oh, mama! I guess being beautiful has its benefits.
 <br>
 Hey, shut up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m embarrassed.
 <br>
 I&#39;m talkin&#39; about me, Donna.
 <br>
 And the best thing about being beautiful is I can get work as a model.
 <br>
 So I don&#39;t have to go to the job fair like the rest of you &#34;uggos.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, I cannot wait.
 <br>
 Nina will be at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 Booth, which means that Fez will be making out during a school day.
 <br>
 How many of you suckers have made out during a school day? How many of you suckers have made out during a school day in the nude? Then I will be nude.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God! - What? What? I got startled, &#39;cause I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so handsome, I thought Shaun Cassidy was sitting in the backseat.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 You are a beautiful male specimen.
 <br>
 Except you have a gray hair.
 <br>
 What? No, I don&#39;t- - [S/ren Wa/ls] - Dude, I hit a cop car.
 <br>
 ## [Rock Group S/ng/ng] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greet/ng] All right, Eric.
 <br>
 Listen up.
 <br>
 You know how your mother and I feel about you and Donna getting engaged.
 <br>
 But since you won&#39;t listen to reason, I&#39;ve come to a decision.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t cancel this engagement I&#39;m not paying for your college.
 <br>
 What? Because he loves you.
 <br>
 No, he doesn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Yes, he does.
 <br>
 He&#39;s full of love.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s buried, just like treasure.
 <br>
 - Dad, how could you do this? - Oh, it&#39;s easy.
 <br>
 Instead of giving $4,000 to a college I leave my checkbook in the drawer, count my money and laugh like a little girl.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 - He laughs because he loves you! - [Sl/d/ng Door Closes] Where did you learn your parenting skills? Korea.
 <br>
 Kitty, I am right about this.
 <br>
 Red, you can&#39;t just force people to do what you want.
 <br>
 Oh, see, that&#39;s one of those things that people say that&#39;s just not true.
 <br>
 Like, &#34;There&#39;s no place like home.
 <br>
 &#34; Hell, I can think of a hundred places better than this.
 <br>
 - I cannot believe you hit a police car.
 <br>
 - [Car Door Opens] Now, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a hot lady cop.
 <br>
 [Sighs] Just watch the master.
 <br>
 License and registration.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Just give me a sec here.
 <br>
 [Grunts] My wallet gets stuck, &#39;cause I&#39;ve been working out.
 <br>
 My leg muscles are huge.
 <br>
 Oh, boy.
 <br>
 By the way, I can bench about 220 so that&#39;d be about two of you, little lady.
 <br>
 What&#39;s your name? Oh, my name is Fez, but I have a girlfriend so you need to cool it, little girl.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll try.
 <br>
 Okay, Mr.
 <br>
 Kelso.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna issue you a citation.
 <br>
 Oh, a citation for being too foxy in a school zone? No.
 <br>
 A citation for $64.
 <br>
 Bench-press that.
 <br>
 So if we don&#39;t break off the engagement, Red&#39;s not gonna pay for my college.
 <br>
 You know, maybe this is it, Eric.
 <br>
 Maybe Red won.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, okay? He&#39;s not gonna win.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;ll just look for something full-time at the job fair.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll pay for college myself.
 <br>
 People do that, right? - Yeah, people with skills.
 <br>
 - But I mean, you&#39;re cute.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a skill.
 <br>
 - Stop.
 <br>
 How can Red do this to me? I swear to God, that man is always mad.
 <br>
 I think the gene for joy might be stored in hair.
 <br>
 Well, there are a lot of angry bald men.
 <br>
 Yul Brynner in The K/ng and I.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Freeze from Batman.
 <br>
 - Remember that time Robin foiled his deep freeze- - Eric.
 <br>
 What did we talk about? - Every time I reference Batman, I owe you a geek dollar.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Guys, something horrible happened.
 <br>
 Let me tell it.
 <br>
 Kelso tried to charm a lady cop, and it didn&#39;t work.
 <br>
 But she was all over me, boy.
 <br>
 I&#39;m like freaking catnip.
 <br>
 Guys, today made me realize looks fade! I&#39;m not- I&#39;m not gonna be able to be a model forever! I&#39;m gonna have to get a practical, realistic job like regular, ugly people.
 <br>
 Okay, so what sounds better- wide receiver or spy? Well, Kelso, I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t just do both.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the perfect cover.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, everybody! This is your last school field trip, so smile! - [Shutter Cl/cks] - [K/tty Laugh/ng] Okay, now wave hello to your futures.
 <br>
 Hello, futures! [Laughs] Okay, now wave good-bye to your mothers who loved you and gave you the best years of their lives.
 <br>
 Now what are they gonna do? What? Tell me what I am supposed to do! You&#39;re supposed to take your little, yellow pill.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do.
 <br>
 Man, look at this place.
 <br>
 There&#39;s tons of butt-ugly people.
 <br>
 One day I&#39;m gonna be one of&#39;em.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t do this.
 <br>
 Being around this many corporate stooges.
 <br>
 [Panting] I can&#39;t breathe! Steven, stop it! This is serious.
 <br>
 If you keep pulling at cotton like that, it won&#39;t rebound.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m off to find Nina for a little field-trip make out.
 <br>
 How many of you suckers have made out during a field trip? What the hell? Was I the only one watching sausage get made? Well, lookee here.
 <br>
 You know, if America&#39;s employers are looking for a pretty-boy moron an engaged hophead and a mush-mouthed foreigner they&#39;re gonna be jumpin&#39; for joy.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Am I the pretty-boy moron? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Cool, &#39;cause that&#39;s the best one.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - So, you&#39;re ready for the big job search? - Yup.
 <br>
 I got my rÃ©sumÃ©, my very best blazer and a really charming story about how my biggest fault is that I just work too darn hard, so- - How &#39;bout you? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 This is so humiliating.
 <br>
 I mean, I have a brain, you know.
 <br>
 by artist and genre.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t do that with my boobs.
 <br>
 That&#39;d be a neat trick though.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the veterinary sciences.
 <br>
 Do you have any jobs available? Yes.
 <br>
 We need someone to usher our four-legged friends into the next life.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 That sounds fantastic.
 <br>
 And how do I do that? You shovel the carcass into the furnace.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve always been fascinated by transportation.
 <br>
 - Do you have any jobs available? - Yes, roadkill remover.
 <br>
 Except sometimes the critter&#39;s not quite dead.
 <br>
 In that case, you gotta shoot it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the &#34;triggerman.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;ve always been fascinated by meat.
 <br>
 - Do you have any jobs available? - Yes.
 <br>
 Triggerman.
 <br>
 Please tell me you&#39;re kidding.
 <br>
 The cows don&#39;t kill themselves, son.
 <br>
 Although I did see one walk right off a cliff once.
 <br>
 Stock boy.
 <br>
 Need a stock boy.
 <br>
 Not you.
 <br>
 So, if I work here will I have to slaughter anything? No, we&#39;re a bank.
 <br>
 We&#39;re looking for tellers.
 <br>
 Uh, just to be perfectly clear I won&#39;t have to murder any animals? Whatever you do on your own time is fine with us.
 <br>
 Hello, First Midwestern! Hi.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Jackie, and this is Steven.
 <br>
 Steven is a no-nonsense Sagittarius who&#39;s not afraid of hard work or true love.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Dave, a shy Pisces who&#39;s looking for love and a salesman to sell on commission.
 <br>
 - The more you sell, the more you can earn.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s perfect for him! Steven, if you can get me to date you, you can sell anything.
 <br>
 Uh, thanks, but no, thanks.
 <br>
 Wait- Are you nuts? That guy almost offered me a job! - So, what&#39;s wrong? - Did you hear him? &#34;The more you sell, the more you earn&#34;? The more you sleep, the more you earn.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my job.
 <br>
 Damn, woman! So, Nina, after walking around the job fair and hearing the word &#34;job&#34; a lot it gave me needs.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 We&#39;re at a job fair.
 <br>
 Please don&#39;t say that word.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t go far from my booth.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my job.
 <br>
 [Whispers] Stop it.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 One of your officers recently issued me a ticket.
 <br>
 - My name is Michael Kelso.
 <br>
 - Michael Kelso.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Officer Debbie? Oh, my God! What happened to you? You&#39;re like your own ugly sister! [Laughing] What do you want, Mr.
 <br>
 Kelso? What do I want? I want to know how one minute you&#39;re all &#34;waa-waa&#34; and the next you&#39;re all- [Imitates Klaxon Blaring] - Good cripes! - Hey, now- I&#39;m just saying, in your uniform you were, like, a totally hot police chick but out of your uniform you&#39;re a total pie face.
 <br>
 I mean, good God! Wait a minute.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, like, you got all your charisma from your uniform.
 <br>
 What is happening to you? Are you having a stroke? What? No, that&#39;s just how I look when I have an idea.
 <br>
 To Eddie.
 <br>
 Love, Hot Donna.
 <br>
 Hot Donna has now signed 87 guys! And two girls.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, like, who knew, in our little town? Well, I can see you got over your little bout of shyness.
 <br>
 Well, what the hell? They think I&#39;m hot.
 <br>
 And you know what? - Hot Donna rules! - [Whooping] So, great news.
 <br>
 I got a job at First Midwestern Bank.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! Eric.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 And they have branches all over Wisconsin.
 <br>
 So wherever you go to school, I&#39;ll have a job.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll save some money.
 <br>
 I can start school, like, a year after you.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t even have to slaughter animals.
 <br>
 Was that ever an option? Ah, apparently it&#39;s the invisible industry of Point Place, yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m actually surprised the streets aren&#39;t running red with blood.
 <br>
 Well, Steven, it is obvious you don&#39;t want a job.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I was just holding out for one that has a cash register with a lock that&#39;s very, very easy to jimmy.
 <br>
 - Oh, God! Excuse me.
 <br>
 - Oh, it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I probably deserved it.
 <br>
 - Roy.
 <br>
 - Steven? Hey, man.
 <br>
 Long time no see.
 <br>
 When my dad left, my mom signed me up for the Big Brother program, and I got Roy.
 <br>
 We had some good times before you left town.
 <br>
 - Yeah, and moved in with a wonderful woman.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 What happened? She found out I was livin&#39; there.
 <br>
 Roy has some problems with people.
 <br>
 They don&#39;t like me.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t like me, right? Not really.
 <br>
 But to be fair, I have very high standards.
 <br>
 Yeah? She&#39;s really nice, Steven.
 <br>
 Hey, so what are you doing here? I work here.
 <br>
 Hotel kitchen manager.
 <br>
 I was gonna put out word that we were lookin&#39; for a cook but then I figured, why bother? They&#39;ll just leave me like everybody else.
 <br>
 So, Roy, seem a little depressed there.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m teetering on the brink.
 <br>
 Maybe I can do something to cheer you up.
 <br>
 Really? Oh, that&#39;d be great.
 <br>
 [Sobbing] So I&#39;m on the Golden Gate Bridge and everyone&#39;s tellin&#39; me to jump.
 <br>
 I was just out for a jog.
 <br>
 Okay, Roy, here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do for you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna take that job as cook and keep you company on two conditions- I&#39;m not gonna work very hard, and you&#39;re gonna have to pay me a lot.
 <br>
 But, man, it&#39;ll be a bargain considering the money you save on hookers and shrinks.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 And if it&#39;s work-related, I can call you at home.
 <br>
 Now I have a reason to get a phone.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re a chef! [Gasps] If you can learn to make those fancy deviled-egg thingies I will lose my frickin&#39; mind! So, how&#39;s the day going? Well, let&#39;s see.
 <br>
 I interviewed four cretins and a mama&#39;s boy.
 <br>
 I vote for the mama&#39;s boy.
 <br>
 I think they&#39;re sweet.
 <br>
 Hey, Dad! Guess what.
 <br>
 I got a job at First Midwestern, so Donna and I can stay engaged.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll work, she&#39;ll study.
 <br>
 In a few years, I can pay for my own tuition.
 <br>
 Yea! I win! [Blows Raspberry] Great news! I&#39;m gonna be a cop! [All Booing] No.
 <br>
 No, listen.
 <br>
 It&#39;s perfect for me.
 <br>
 The uniform will keep me looking hot even when I&#39;m old.
 <br>
 And plus, I love helping people.
 <br>
 No, you love humping people.
 <br>
 Eric, a lot of times humping /s helping.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re really gonna be a cop? Well, he did shoot me, so we know he&#39;s good with guns.
 <br>
 And you just know they&#39;re gonna partner him up with a dog.
 <br>
 Actually, you know what? It&#39;s kind of perfect.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll get to run through people&#39;s backyards with a stick.
 <br>
 He does that anyway.
 <br>
 The important thing is, is that I&#39;ll be performing a very valuable community service.
 <br>
 And plus, I&#39;ll be sexy forever.
 <br>
 I mean, just think about it.
 <br>
 Nobody move! This is a robbery.
 <br>
 Not in my town, dirtbag.
 <br>
 Oh, Officer, not only did you perform a valuable community service you&#39;ll be sexy forever! All in a day&#39;s work, ma&#39;am.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get you into something a little more comfortable.
 <br>
 - But I&#39;m already in a bikini.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 Kelso, you do realize you&#39;ll have to help ugly people too.
 <br>
 Nah-uh.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just leave that for the fat cops.
 <br>
 - [TV: Sports Crowd Cheer/ng] - Hey.
 <br>
 I just got off the phone with the bank.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t get the job because someone gave me a bad reference.
 <br>
 And then I thought to myself &#34;Hmm.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve only had one boss-you!&#34; I can&#39;t believe you blackballed your own son! As usual, I don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re talking about.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re not even man enough to admit it? You know what I think? You&#39;re a bitter, old man who&#39;s so miserable in his life that you have to make everyone else just as miserable as you are! - You&#39;re pathetic! - Honey.
 <br>
 Your father didn&#39;t call the bank manager.
 <br>
 I did.
 <br>
 Mom, please stay out of this.
 <br>
 What was that? - I gave you the bad reference.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Then, uh- [Chuckling] I&#39;m just kidding.
 <br>
 Eric, if you take a bank job and put off school you&#39;ll never go to college, and the bank manager agreed with me.
 <br>
 Plus, I told him you were bad at math.
 <br>
 So there&#39;s no job money to pay for college no money from you guys to go to college.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I guess we&#39;re really hoping for that football scholarship, huh? I have a compromise.
 <br>
 Your father and I will pay for college if you and Donna will agree to just put off your engagement for one year.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not compromising anything! He said some hurtful things.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sick of being controlled by both of you guys.
 <br>
 You guys can keep your money, okay, &#39;cause guess what! I don&#39;t want it.
 <br>
 Ma&#39;am! Sir! We got a call about a domestic disturbance.
 <br>
 Get out of here.
 <br>
 Okay, but if I gotta come back out here, somebody&#39;s going downtown.
 <br>
 Well, quit it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just practicing.
 <br>
 A-And this is the pantry.
 <br>
 If you ever get really depressed, it&#39;s a good place to go and cry.
 <br>
 Also, it&#39;s where we keep the mustard.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Cool.
 <br>
 Well, uh, I guess I&#39;ll see you on Monday.
 <br>
 - Okay! - [Grunts] Okay, man.
 <br>
 Okay, Roy.
 <br>
 Get off me! Oh, I almost forgot to show you the walk-in freezer.
 <br>
 A little privacy, please!
 <br>
