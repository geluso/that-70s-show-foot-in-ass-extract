 A while back, I&#39;m in my car crying, &#39;cause Midgie was gone and I kept having to reach into the glove box for tissues.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s dangerous.
 <br>
 One time I had to blow my nose.
 <br>
 Nearly hit that cockeyed girl down the street.
 <br>
 I could&#39;ve sworn she was lookin&#39; right at me.

 So I attached a box of tissues to the sun visor sold the idea for a bundle, and voila.
 <br>
 The Weeper Keeper was born.

 Oh, God.
 <br>
 Are you rich again? Yep.

 Just picked up two sombreros and a case of Lik-m-aid.
 <br>
 Where are you gonna wear a sombrero, Bob? Where won&#39;t I wear it? [ Scoffs ] Okay, you guys, which one of these lucky ladies gets to go out with Point Place High&#39;s Most Eligible Viking? Start with the gymnastics team, but go with the second string- just as limber and somethin&#39; to prove.
 <br>
 - How about her? - Yeah, I made out with her once.
 <br>
 Okay, I don&#39;t want my tongue where Kelso&#39;s tongue has been.
 <br>
 Oh, you better stay away from your mom then.
 <br>
 I was kidding! - What about her? - Hey, I know her, man.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not all there, if you know what I mean.
 <br>
 - She&#39;s a space case, huh? - No, she&#39;s missing a toe.

 <br>
 - God, that totally slipped my mind - although I think I have a copy right here.
 <br>
 - [ Gasps ] Look at him.
 <br>
 Donna, you have to start dating, or you&#39;re gonna look pathetic.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna look pathetic for being seen with you.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I &#39;ll set you up.

 Rhonda just said she has something special to share with me tomorrow night.
 <br>
 It can only mean that we&#39;re going to do it! [ Laughing ] No, no, no.
 <br>
 Listen to me.
 <br>
 I need a place to do it- roomy and cheap.
 <br>
 Just like my Rhonda.
 <br>
 You can use the Fotohut, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m always happy to lend it out for deflowering and bar mitzvahs.
 <br>
 Thank you, Leo.
 <br>
 Tomorrow night, Fez becomes a man.
 <br>
 Oh, so it is a bar mitzvah.
 <br>
 Well, Bob, thanks for insisting on coming along.
 <br>
 So, Red, what&#39;s so special about this thing? It&#39;s barely got a trunk.
 <br>
 Where do you put the groceries? This car isn&#39;t about groceries.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about freedom.
 <br>
 Speaking of freedom, they got free doughnuts.
 <br>
 [ Exhales ] [ Laughs ] [ Imitates Engine Running ] -  [ Orchestrai Fllm Score ] - [ Imitating Engine Continues ] So long, dumb-ass! [ Laughs ] -  [ Continues ] - [ Imitating Engine Continues ] - Hey, Red.

 Oh.
 <br>
 Glad you like it.
 <br>
 I just bought it.
 <br>
 You what? Yeah, I&#39;m pickin&#39; it up tomorrow.
 <br>

 <br>
 [ Cheering ] Oh, is it my turn? Oh, funny, &#39;cause tonight is also my turn- Ah! To do it.
 <br>
 Guess what, Eric? Donna has a date tonight too.
 <br>
 Yep, yep, yep.
 <br>
 Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 I set her up with Michael&#39;s older brother, Casey.
 <br>
 [ Laughing ] Oh, man, Donna&#39;s going out with Casey Keiso? Casey &#34;What&#39;s the big deal? It&#39;s just a misdemeanor&#34; Kelso? Man, that&#39;s gonna be the best bad date ever.
 <br>
 Hey, we should hide in the trunk.
 <br>
 Oh, like Sprytle and Chimchim! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I would pay to see that date.
 <br>
 Oh, uh- [ High-pitched Voice ] &#34;So, Casey what are your thoughts on feminism?&#34; &#34;Well, Donna, I think it can munch my butt.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39; - Oh.
 <br>
 - [ Laughing ] All right.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 My brother&#39;s not that bad, okay? He taught us lot of good, useful stuff about chicks llke, the bigger the boobs, the smaller the brain.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a timeless truth.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you another timeless truth.
 <br>
 [ Singsong Voice ] I&#39;m going to do it! I don&#39;t know why I let you set me up with Casey Kelso.
 <br>
 From what I remember, he&#39;s, like, a Kelso.
 <br>
 - [Horn Honking] - [ Gasps ] Ooh, he&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Okay, come on.
 <br>
 Try to look pretty.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it? That&#39;s all I get is a honk? What kind of a jerk won&#39;t even come to the door? [ Western ] Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Casey? Hey, Pinciotti.
 <br>
 Man, you really grew into those legs.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And you- Your arms seem bigger.
 <br>
 You- [ Laughs ] - So you ready to roll? - Roll? I &#39;m ready.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re gonna roll.
 <br>
 -  [ Western ] [Ends ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Fez, honey, what are you- Did you come for cake? No, I- Do you have cake? No, no, no.
 <br>
 I came- I came here because I have this friend.
 <br>
 Oh, really? What&#39;s his name? Name? Uh Johnny Table.
 <br>
 And what&#39;s Johnny Table&#39;s problem? Well, he and his girlfriend are about to do something very special for the first time.
 <br>
 You mean, they&#39;re going to engage in- Putt-putt.
 <br>
 They are going- They&#39;re going to putt-putt.
 <br>
 And-And-And she has putted around quite a bit.
 <br>
 But-But he is a virgin, uh, putter- a-a virgin putter.
 <br>
 - He has never putted.
 <br>
 - I see.
 <br>
 And my friend, uh- Ay.
 <br>
 -Johnny Table? - Yes.
 <br>
 Um, he cannot talk to Eric or Kelso or Hyde because they make fun of me- him-Johnny Table.
 <br>
 So he&#39;s coming to you.
 <br>
 Well, honey, you tell Johnny Table to be respectful and wear a condom.
 <br>
 - Thankyou, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good advice.
 <br>
 - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 - So, um, may I have my piece of cake now? - Mm-hmm.
 <br>
 And one forJohnny Table.
 <br>
 So when my dad saw that I had broken the TV with the bowling ball, I said - &#34;You fix it, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39; - [ Gasps ] Ah, it shut him up.
 <br>
 You know, Eric, I&#39;ve had a crush on you for so long.
 <br>
 Well, since the paper came out.
 <br>
 [ Giggles ] Oh, right, the Most Eligible Viking.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s just good reporting.
 <br>
 [ Laughs, Sighs ] -  [Radio: Rock ] - I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re Kelso&#39;s brother.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;re nothing like him.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause he&#39;s, like- And you&#39;re all- - Hey, you want a cold one? - Okay.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 [ Laughs ] This is fun.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been spending, like, way too much time worrying about my mom and stuff.
 <br>
 Hey, I learned something in the army.
 <br>
 When things are tough turn up the music and crack open another beer.
 <br>
 Yeah, you mean, like, things will eventually get better? I don&#39;t know about that.
 <br>
 But if they don&#39;t, at least you&#39;ll have a beer.
 <br>
 Red, guess what? I went down to pay for my Corvette, and some jerk-wad bought it out from under me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s a tough break, Bob.
 <br>
 But you know what would make you feel better? A iook at my new Corvette.
 <br>
 [ Softly ] Oh, my goodness, it&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 You bought my car? That doesn&#39;t make me feel better, Red.
 <br>
 I &#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Did I say make you feel better? I meant make me feel better.
 <br>
 [ Honking ] Leo, thanks for letting me use the Fotohut for my date with Rhonda.
 <br>
 And when I say date, I mean- [ Singsong Voice ] Do it! - Hi, Fez.
 <br>
 - Rhonda, you look beautiful.
 <br>
 [ Snorts, Laughs ] Well, I&#39;ll leave you two with the same advice my father gave me: &#34;Get a job, dopehead.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39; So, here we are.
 <br>
 You know, Fez, I &#39;ve been with a lot of guys.
 <br>
 You&#39;re more special than any of them.
 <br>
 Now, I &#39;ve cleared a space right over here- And-And because I care about you and about us I wanna wait.
 <br>
 Wait? Rhonda, hear me now: Things are turning blue.
 <br>
 But- But-But, Fez, I love ya.
 <br>
 But- But! Oh, I love you too.
 <br>
 - Really? - Yes, damn it.
 <br>
 So, if you want to wait, we&#39;ll wait.
 <br>
 Ah, come here, Cocoa Puff.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is nice.
 <br>
 Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to go sit in the snow.
 <br>
 So, anyway, I just turn to my dad and I say - &#34;Yes, I am some sort of wiseass.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39; - [ Gasps ] - Well, shut him up.
 <br>
 - [ Laughs ] Anyway, this was fun.
 <br>
 - Call me? - Okay.
 <br>
 - [ Giggles ] - Hey, Emily! - On the phone, silly.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 I am silly.
 <br>
 Hey, Foreplay, is that you? &#34;Foreplay.
 <br>
 &#34;&#39; I forgot about that.
 <br>
 - Come here, little guy.
 <br>
 - Okay, all right.
 <br>
 Okay, all right.
 <br>
 Good to see you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, all right.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Man, you haven&#39;t changed a bit.
 <br>
 You still got that haircut, huh? No.
 <br>
 So, uh, they let you out of the army, huh? Yeah.
 <br>
 It was kinda like they were always tryin&#39; to tell me what to do.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, Pinciotti tells me you and her used to go out, but you dumped her.
 <br>
 Well, yeah.
 <br>
 But it was kind of complicated with the ring.
 <br>
 - And we talked, but she- - Yeah, it&#39;s a great story.
 <br>
 [ Laughs ] - Anyhow, I&#39;ll see you around, Pinciotti.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 You too, Foreplay.
 <br>
 Yeah, okay.
 <br>
 Ooh, Casey Kelso, huh? Better luck next time.
 <br>
 No, actually, I think I might go out with him again.
 <br>
 [ Laughs ] Okay! What- Okay.
 <br>
 But, um, I have just two words for you: Donna Kelso.
 <br>
 See ya.
 <br>
 What- No! But think of the children! Little redheaded morons.
 <br>
 They&#39;d have to go to special schools.
 <br>
 It&#39;d be expensive.
 <br>
 Donna and Casey? [ Laughs ] He&#39;s a Kelso! Behold, my friends.
 <br>
 Your lovable foreign exchange student Fez has done it with a woman.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m still a virgin! You forced it out of me.
 <br>
 Stop looking at me!
