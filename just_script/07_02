<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Mmm, blonde.
 <br>
 More fun.
 <br>
 Everything is more fun.
 <br>
 Donna, if you only knew what I&#39;d like to do with you and your new hair, you would beat the crap out of me.
 <br>
 - You know, I just might beat the crap out of you anyway.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 So now that donna&#39;s not big red anymore, I guess we have to go back to what we called her when she was 12 jugs-a-poppin&#39;.
 <br>
 - Man, I hated jugs-a-poppin&#39;.
 <br>
 - Well, you shouldn&#39;t have had poppin&#39; jugs.
 <br>
 Speaking of objectifying women, jackie, there&#39;s a &#34;take back the night&#34; rally tonight at the park.
 <br>
 Do you want to go? Oh, and be with your deep-voiced gal pals? Hmm, no, thank you.
 <br>
 This is important.
 <br>
 Women should be able to walk through the park at night without being harassed by weirdo men.
 <br>
 Hey, that was one time.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 - Really? You&#39;d be, like, the only guy there.
 <br>
 Although there is some question about shirley.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;ll be great.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you come by when hyde&#39;s dad is here? We&#39;ll go over there after that.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s my steven&#39;s big night.
 <br>
 He finally decided he wants to meet his real daddy.
 <br>
 Kept hearing this voice telling me, &#34;meet your father.
 <br>
 Meet your father.
 <br>
 &#34; So finally, I said, &#34;okay.
 <br>
 &#34; Jackie shut the hell up.
 <br>
 I did.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a true story.
 <br>
 Get off the phone! Okay, any minute now brooke is going into labor, all right? And I gave her the number of all the places I was gonna be.
 <br>
 I cannot miss this call.
 <br>
 Lookin&#39; good there, big red.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going with jugs-a-poppin&#39; again.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s a good one, and it&#39;s as true now as it was the first day of fifth grade.
 <br>
 That was a poppin&#39; summer.
 <br>
 Steven, I am so happy we finally found your real father.
 <br>
 Here, I framed the blood test results for you.
 <br>
 Now I spoke to him this morning, and I told him how your parents abandoned you, and we took you in, and it&#39;s hard for you to say it out loud, but that you love me because I saved your life.
 <br>
 - Kitty, I&#39;m not sure - He would be dead on the streets.
 <br>
 okay, he&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Now, steven, fix your hair.
 <br>
 Eric, don&#39;t mumble.
 <br>
 Red, don&#39;t yell at eric if he mumbles.
 <br>
 Hi, is this the formans? You know, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I told your friend last week we don&#39;t want a subscription to &#34;ebony&#34; magazine.
 <br>
 No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 We spoke over the phone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m william barnett.
 <br>
 I&#39;m steven&#39;s father.
 <br>
 Oh! I mean, come in.
 <br>
 Come in.
 <br>
 Everybody, I want you to meet steven&#39;s father.
 <br>
 Steven, look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m looking.
 <br>
 It&#39;s good to meet you, son.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve really been looking forward to this.
 <br>
 Wanted to get you a card, but they don&#39;t have one for our unique situation.
 <br>
 So here.
 <br>
 Happy first communion.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 You came from him? Yeah, I&#39;m not sure I see the resemblance.
 <br>
 What are you talking about? My &#39;fro, my coolness, my suspicion of the man this explains so much.
 <br>
 Merci à  Well, mr.
 <br>
 Barnett, please sit anywhere you&#39;d like on this big day.
 <br>
 After all, how often does a kid get to meet his very own father? So far I&#39;m up to twice.
 <br>
 Hey, would you like a drink? Perhaps a cool drink for our.
 <br>
 cool visitor.
 <br>
 No, thanks, but I think all of you could use a scotch.
 <br>
 That&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 We&#39;re totally relaxed.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what show I love? &#34;The jeffersons.
 <br>
 &#34; Dyn-o-mite! Right? &#34;Dyn-o-mite&#34; is from &#34;good times.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, well, I watch them all.
 <br>
 I mean, I don&#39;t discriminate.
 <br>
 So father and son.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 Well, I.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I guess steven must have gotten his mother&#39;s eyes.
 <br>
 Eyes.
 <br>
 Steven got his mother&#39;s pretty eyes.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Or as I like to say, right on.
 <br>
 Okay, well, nobody&#39;s talking about the elephant in the room, so I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re black.
 <br>
 Mom! Okay, please, mr.
 <br>
 Barnett, we&#39;re very open-minded.
 <br>
 Oh, no, he&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I, myself, love that singer Art Garfunkel.
 <br>
 Art Garfunkel is white.
 <br>
 Really? Well, his name&#39;s got the &#34;funk&#34; in it, so I oh, wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Red, who&#39;s that black person I like? - Martin luther king? - Yes! You know, I&#39;m beginning to feel like you haven&#39;t had a lot of black people in this house.
 <br>
 Well, I mean, certainly not because we didn&#39;t want to.
 <br>
 Right, right.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s just there haven&#39;t been any available.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s Wisconsin.
 <br>
 Well, I knowall about Wisconsin.
 <br>
 The only place around here where you&#39;ll see whiteand black together is on a cow.
 <br>
 yeah, sure, sure, yeah.
 <br>
 So, william, - what kind of work do you do? - I own a chain of record stores.
 <br>
 Record stores that&#39;s cool, huh? I was afraid you were gonna be a cop or something.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like cops.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like cops, either.
 <br>
 Hey, who do you think shot J.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 K.
 <br>
 ? I don&#39;t know because they don&#39;t want me to know.
 <br>
 Check it out, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a chip off the old block.
 <br>
 Man, I wish mom had told me about you.
 <br>
 - Hey, when was the last time you saw her? - Oh, years ago.
 <br>
 We were dating, and she just disappeared.
 <br>
 I guess she married the man you thought was your father and told him that you were his baby.
 <br>
 Yeah, mom must have been pretty relieved when I came out white,huh? Hello.
 <br>
 Brooke, it&#39;s me Did you have the baby yet? No, are you sure? Okay, well, I&#39;m in the kitchen now, so no, it&#39;s the same number, but I&#39;m in the kitchen, so when you call no, you just gotta think, &#34;kitchen, kitchen, kitchen.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay.
 <br>
 This is so exciting.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going to be a father.
 <br>
 and I&#39;m going to be all alone.
 <br>
 My clock is ticking.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t want to screw this thing up, you know? When that kid opens his eyes, I want his daddy who loves him to be the first thing he sees.
 <br>
 Plus, I don&#39;t want him to get switched at birth with one of those babies that doesn&#39;t speak english.
 <br>
 Why are you here?! This isn&#39;t your home! It still wouldn&#39;t kill you to put up some pictures of me.
 <br>
 I got it! Hello.
 <br>
 Charlie Schmidt! I haven&#39;t talked to you since the war.
 <br>
 You know,I wasn&#39;t even sure they pulled you out of the water.
 <br>
 - If I had known - never call here again! - Kelso! - Well, I gotta keep the line open.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna kill you and mount your head on the tv.
 <br>
 And if it helps me get better reception, it&#39;ll do more for me than you have in your whole life.
 <br>
 Ooh, fez, michael, meet william barnett, steven&#39;s father.
 <br>
 Good to meet you both.
 <br>
 Would you look at that.
 <br>
 Yeah, I&#39;m half black, man.
 <br>
 It kinda puts all the pieces of the puzzle together, don&#39;t it? Hey, I&#39;m having a kid soon.
 <br>
 I wonder if mine&#39;s gonna be half black.
 <br>
 Is the mother black? No.
 <br>
 I have to say, mr.
 <br>
 Barnett, it&#39;s nice to see another person of color in this town.
 <br>
 White people, you know what I&#39;m talking about? Can&#39;t say that I do.
 <br>
 Oh, I hear you, brother man.
 <br>
 Eric,are you ready to go? I want to get to the feminist rally in time for the Hugh Hefner piñata.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Barnett, this is Donna.
 <br>
 Donna, this is I&#39;m Steven&#39;s father.
 <br>
 I&#39;m black, and it&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Whoa, donna, please, do not flip out on the man just because of the color of his skin.
 <br>
 I would never do that.
 <br>
 I would never do that.
 <br>
 Okay, donna, let&#39;s just go, and maybe in the car we can have a little talk about how hurtful our preconceived notions can be.
 <br>
 Power.
 <br>
 Steven, this is so exciting.
 <br>
 - I know.
 <br>
 I met my dad.
 <br>
 - And he&#39;s rich.
 <br>
 Now instead of waiting for you to get off your butt and make some money, we can just inherit it.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 You mean inherit it from me? No, no, no, no.
 <br>
 All she means is that you are doing quite well.
 <br>
 When I talked to your secretary, and she put me on hold, there was music on the line.
 <br>
 I thought to myself, &#34;well, this is a man who can afford a thing or two.
 <br>
 &#34; I see.
 <br>
 So you knew I had money before you invited me here.
 <br>
 Is that supposed to mean something? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you tell me, Steven? What are you talking about? Well, I mean, we don&#39;t have to play games.
 <br>
 I can give you money if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after.
 <br>
 That&#39;s who you think I am? - I&#39;ll see you guys later No, you know what? - Steven.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t need anything from him growing up, and I don&#39;t need anything from him now.
 <br>
 You know, that was very rude of you.
 <br>
 And I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this to someone wearing cashmere, but, well, I don&#39;t think we can be friends.
 <br>
 how could you say that to steven? He doesn&#39;t want your money.
 <br>
 I want your money.
 <br>
 How could you think that anybody here needs your money? Look at this place.
 <br>
 Glass grapes, pizza rolls, an organ.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 it&#39;s like carnegie hall.
 <br>
 I stand by what I said.
 <br>
 What else was I supposed to think? You&#39;re supposed to look at me and know that I raised fine young men, even though one of them is at a feminist rally.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Barnett, you are wrong about steven.
 <br>
 He&#39;s perfect.
 <br>
 I think you should go.
 <br>
 I agree.
 <br>
 I was gonna pack you some leftovers, but that ship has sailed, mister.
 <br>
 I hope this doesn&#39;t discourage you from inviting a second black person into your home.
 <br>
 - What do we want? - A safe park! - And when do we want it? - Now! - I can&#39;t hear you, ladies.
 <br>
 When do we want it? - Now! Whoo! Yeah! Take back the night! This feels really good, Donna.
 <br>
 Women should be able to walk through this park without being afraid.
 <br>
 In fact, some day I hope that I can walk through this park without being afraid.
 <br>
 It helps to whistle.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m really glad you came with me.
 <br>
 And I love seeing how passionate you got singing &#34;I am woman.
 <br>
 &#34; I&#39;m having a lot of fun, donna.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sorry, but you look so hot, your new blonde hair shining in the light of the burning effigy of that molester.
 <br>
 Hey, I got an idea.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t we go &#34;take back&#34; the area behind that bench? - When do you want it? - Now.
 <br>
 brooke, did you have the baby yet? fez? No, this is your baby, and I&#39;m really ugly.
 <br>
 Okay, I know this is a prank &#39;cause there&#39;s no way my baby would be ugly.
 <br>
 hello.
 <br>
 yes, is your refrigerator running? Because if it is, you&#39;d better go catch it.
 <br>
 Ah-burn! Stop calling me! what?! Are you mad? No, fez.
 <br>
 You sound mad.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 You say the words, but I can tell you don&#39;t mean it.
 <br>
 Look, just don&#39;t call meanymore.
 <br>
 why do you keep hanging up on me if you&#39;re not mad? I&#39;m waiting to hear from the mother of my child.
 <br>
 So you are mad.
 <br>
 Curl up with the phone so we can talk this over.
 <br>
 - Fez, I&#39;m hanging up.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 Just hang up then.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Are you still there? Yeah, I&#39;m still here.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Thanks for not hanging up.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just so mad at that William Barnett.
 <br>
 I mean, thinking you wanted something from him.
 <br>
 Everyone knows I&#39;m all you&#39;ve ever desired.
 <br>
 Look, if I was in his place, I probably would have thought the same thing, you know? It&#39;s not a big deal.
 <br>
 I just wanted to meet the guy and find out if he looked like I imagined my father would look like.
 <br>
 By the way, no.
 <br>
 Well, who needs a father anyway? You know what? I&#39;ve been doing just fine since my dad disappeared into the jungle to bring freedom to the grateful natives.
 <br>
 Jackie, your father&#39;s in prison for embezzling $60,000 from the city.
 <br>
 I&#39;m pretty.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t contradict me.
 <br>
 hey, hey, ho, ho! This park is our sand &#34;no&#34; means no.
 <br>
 hey, hey, ho, ho! This park is our sand &#34;no&#34; means no.
 <br>
 you know what&#39;s great? There&#39;s, like, half a dozen women on the other side of that hedge who would kill to be where I am right now.
 <br>
 - Ow, ow,you&#39;re on my hair.
 <br>
 - Your beautiful blonde hair? Ow! Get off! Get off! Hey, there&#39;s a woman in trouble! Let&#39;s get him, sisters! no, no! That&#39;s right, you pervert.
 <br>
 &#34;No&#34; means no.
 <br>
 No, ladies, please, I&#39;m one of you.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s put these work boots to use! Yeah! Run, eric! Run like Bruce Jenner.
 <br>
 Oh, crap, he doesn&#39;t know sports.
 <br>
 open up, it&#39;s dr.
 <br>
 Baby doctor.
 <br>
 I have your baby, and he wants to talk to you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not a doctor, and I don&#39;t have your baby.
 <br>
 Ah-burn! That was a good one.
 <br>
 Listen, this baby stuff&#39;s, like, really important to me, okay? So I&#39;m trying to take it seriously.
 <br>
 Hey, say no more.
 <br>
 My sensitive friend, I am sorry.
 <br>
 No more phone pranks from now on.
 <br>
 learn to trust your friends.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Sexy&#39;s pizza.
 <br>
 Our special today is sexaroni.
 <br>
 Fez, God! Hello.
 <br>
 Brooke! What? Your water broke? What does that mean? Oh, god, that&#39;s disgusting! No, why would you tell me that? Oh, jeez! Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m on my way.
 <br>
 This is it! I&#39;m having a baby! Go get &#39;em, buddy! Mr.
 <br>
 Sexy&#39;s pizza.
 <br>
 Our special today is sexaroni.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s like pepperoni, but sexy.
 <br>
 You you mean you want some? we&#39;re closed.
 <br>
 hey.
 <br>
 Hey, I was wondering if maybe we could try this again.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, it worked so well the first time.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry about that.
 <br>
 Thing is, if I grew up with nothing, and found out I had a dad with money, I would have thought maybe he owed me something.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s not me.
 <br>
 I know, but when we first met, I thought I saw myself in you.
 <br>
 Yeah, I can see that.
 <br>
 You and me.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 it&#39;s like looking in a mirror.
 <br>
 So you want to go get a beer or something? I can get you in some places you&#39;ve probably never been to.
 <br>
 Oh, like that cool jazz bar off the highway? No, no, I&#39;m talking about country clubs, fancy restaurants.
 <br>
 I&#39;m rich as hell, man.
 <br>
 Everything okay here, steven? Yeah, everything&#39;s fine.
 <br>
 I am so glad you&#39;re back.
 <br>
 I felt horrible letting you go off without any leftovers.
 <br>
 It was nice meeting you,red, and you&#39;re right.
 <br>
 You have raised some fine young men.
 <br>
 &#34;Pig&#34; &#34;No means No&#34; Yeah, I&#39;m real proud of &#39;em.
 <br>
 They stole all my clothes.
 <br>
 - Who? - The angry mob of feminists.
 <br>
 Oh, man, look at you.
 <br>
 They even shaved off all your body hair.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, they did.
 <br>
 So kelso has a child.
 <br>
 I cannot wait to see the smile on that sweet little face, And i bet the baby&#39;s cute, too.
 <br>
 It is so cool that Steven&#39;s father&#39;s rich.
 <br>
 It almost makes up for my father Being locked away in pris I mean, Native land.
 <br>
 Eric, i&#39;m so sorry about What happened at the rally.
 <br>
 It was like watching an antelope Get taken down On &#34;wild kingdom.
 <br>
 &#34; This is permanent marker, donna.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think this is coming off!
 <br>
