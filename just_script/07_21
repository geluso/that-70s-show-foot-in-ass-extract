 That was probably our second-best potato chip war ever.
 <br>
 What the hell ?! We&#39;ll clean it up later, dude.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not your &#34;dude,&#34; and you never clean anything up.
 <br>
 Well, we mean to, but then we leave, and then we come back, and it&#39;s already cleaned up.
 <br>
 You eat my food, you dirty up my house and every time I go into a bedroom, I have to wonder about finding one of you naked with some poor girl ! Well, at least you know that if you find me naked in a room, I&#39;m by myself.
 <br>
 All right, I want everybody who doesn&#39;t live in this house to get out now ! You know what ? You&#39;re a real bummer, man.
 <br>
 Come on, fez, let&#39;s go to our new apartment where people can do whatever they want, whenever they want.
 <br>
 Just like the bible says, &#34;let my people do whatever they want.
 <br>
 &#34; eric, the high school sent over your transcript, which means you can start applying to teachers&#39; college.
 <br>
 Now you tell me what school you wanna go to, and I will send them a pie.
 <br>
 Because you cannot eat a lady&#39;s pie and then not let her son into the school.
 <br>
 I gotta admit, forman, it&#39;s nice finally seeing you do something with your life.
 <br>
 It almost inspires me to make my record store the best damn store in the region.
 <br>
 Nah.
 <br>
 It says here that eric got an &#34;I-n-c&#34; in gym class.
 <br>
 &#34;I-n-C.
 <br>
 &#34; I bet that stands for &#34;incredible.
 <br>
 &#34; Kitty, it&#39;s &#34;incomplete.
 <br>
 &#34; I know.
 <br>
 You have to add the &#34;redible.
 <br>
 &#34; You have failed &#34;to meet the requirements for graduation.
 <br>
 To receive your diploma, &#34;you must attend summer session P.
 <br>
 E.
 <br>
 &#34; Ha ! Ha ? I didn&#39;t graduate, and all you have to say is &#34;ha&#34; ? Oh.
 <br>
 And also, hee hee.
 <br>
 This sucks.
 <br>
 Yep, but you have to remember one thing, forman.
 <br>
 It only sucks for you.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 7 Episode 21 &#34;2120 so Michigan ave&#34; I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m back in gym, or as I like to call it, &#34;the institute of things I can&#39;t do.
 <br>
 &#34; Casey kelso ? Hi there, pinciotti.
 <br>
 Wow, look who you got with you little foreplay.
 <br>
 Yep, that&#39;s me, okay.
 <br>
 Okay, okay ! Okay.
 <br>
 And, ms.
 <br>
 Forman, god, you get younger every time I see you.
 <br>
 Oh, me too.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 Pinciotti, you are looking so good.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry i&#39;ve ever broke up with you ? thing is, see, I got this tendency to, uh what&#39;s the word ? Smolder ? I think the word you&#39;re looking for is ditch, bail, run away.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 Oh, wait, did you say &#34;bail&#34; ? Yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 So, casey, how did we get so lucky to see you here today a little bit sweaty ? well, um, I&#39;m the teacher.
 <br>
 no way.
 <br>
 That&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 It looks like a normal gym, but apparently I&#39;ve stumbled into the mouth of hell.
 <br>
 The coach needed someone to fill in, so he called the best quarterback that point place high ever had.
 <br>
 And I figured, you know, the cheerleaders they practice in here, so it&#39;d give me a good chance to see what&#39;s gonna be on the market in a couple years.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe that you get to decide whether or not I graduate high school.
 <br>
 Well, look, I tell you what, you give me one pull-up over there, I&#39;ll tell the school you passed.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s get this done, foreplay.
 <br>
 Get over there.
 <br>
 Hey, pinciotti, you see all these eighth grade boys checking you out ? No, they&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Really ? Hi, boys ! All righty, let&#39;s get this done.
 <br>
 Here we go ! just, uh, getting in a really good stretch here.
 <br>
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 <br>
 Let me show you how it&#39;s done, foreplay.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s trickier than it looks.
 <br>
 You rea oh, you got it.
 <br>
 Good, yeah.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what I was going for.
 <br>
 Phew, is it hot in here or what ? Okay, fez, this bedroom&#39;s clearly better, &#39;cause it has its own bathroom, so I&#39;m go ahead and be the bigger man and give it to myself.
 <br>
 But I need a room with its own bathroom.
 <br>
 Otherwise I&#39;m gonna have to walk through the living room when, you know, when I want to have a moment with myself.
 <br>
 That&#39;s too bad.
 <br>
 I want it.
 <br>
 - I want it.
 <br>
 - Well, I want it ! - I want it ! - I want it ! - I&#39;ll kill you ! - What ? Okay, wait, wait.
 <br>
 Fine, you can take it.
 <br>
 I  don&#39;t want it anyway.
 <br>
 I was in there earlier, and I think I heard voices.
 <br>
 Voices ? What kind of voices ? Well, they weren&#39;t unfriendly.
 <br>
 They kept saying, &#34;get out !&#34; I  don&#39;t want the haunted room.
 <br>
 - Well, I don&#39;t want it.
 <br>
 - Well, I don&#39;t want it ! Okay, fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take the room of death, but you owe me one.
 <br>
 Thanks, man.
 <br>
 hi, boys.
 <br>
 I brought you a housewarming gift glass grapes ! every so often, someone tries to eat one.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a real conversation-starter.
 <br>
 I remember.
 <br>
 Hmm, you know, it looks like you might need some help unpacking.
 <br>
 Kitty, no ! Oh, just sit.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just be a minute.
 <br>
 But remember, you are a guest in these kids&#39; home, just like they&#39;ve been a guest in our home for years.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a guest, just like they&#39;ve been guests in my house.
 <br>
 Hey, that was my program.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s a bummer.
 <br>
 Oops.
 <br>
 What kind of animal just dumps food on someone&#39;s couch ? I&#39;ll clean it up later, dude.
 <br>
 Okay, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going down.
 <br>
 Or I mean, I&#39;m coming up.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s not pretend like this is gonna happen, okay, forehead ? Forehead ? That&#39;S come on, man, that&#39;s not even good.
 <br>
 They&#39;re all good to me, forehead, but tell you what.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll pass you if you can tell me one thing.
 <br>
 How does a guy that can&#39;t even do one pull-up get someone like donna ? Wow.
 <br>
 You know, at least I&#39;m not the dillhole who&#39;s strutting around the gym with my whistle thinking I&#39;m all cool because I&#39;m teaching summer school P.
 <br>
 E.
 <br>
 To a bunch of botards.
 <br>
 Man, I think it&#39;s really weird that you&#39;d say that to me, forehead, especially since I was just about to sign your transcript, but I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Now it seems like I&#39;ve lost my pen.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t lose okay, listen up.
 <br>
 I want to teach you all a little game.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called target.
 <br>
 Yeah ! Ooh, what&#39;s target ? all right, all moved in.
 <br>
 Château kelso is open for business.
 <br>
 You know, &#34;château&#34; is german for &#34;mister.
 <br>
 &#34; Michael, you should have gotten the room with the bathroom.
 <br>
 You earned it be being born better-looking.
 <br>
 Oh, well, I coulda had it, but fez said that there were evil spirits in there, so I made him take it.
 <br>
 Sucker.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t believe you fell for that, especially after that time he told you evil spirits lived in that hot dog, and then you gave him that.
 <br>
 Wait, are you saying he&#39;s tricking me ? Foreigners always lie.
 <br>
 That&#39;s how the indians tricked us into buying new mexico.
 <br>
 You boys are gonna need a plumber.
 <br>
 I tried to flush your pillow down the toilet.
 <br>
 It just wouldn&#39;t go.
 <br>
 Ooh, matches ! Hi, honey.
 <br>
 How was your first day of school ? It was awful.
 <br>
 Casey&#39;s definitely gonna fail me.
 <br>
 Oh, that doesn&#39;t sound like my casey.
 <br>
 I mean, the world&#39;s casey.
 <br>
 Man, it&#39;s like I finally figured out what I want to do with my life, and now I might never be able to do it, and might I add, through no fault of my own.
 <br>
 Eric, the last time you used the phrase &#34;through no fault of my own&#34; was when you said, &#34;donna, your cat&#39;s dead &#34;through no fault of my own,&#34; which I later found out meant, &#34;donna, I ran over your cat.
 <br>
 &#34; What did you do in class ? Were you being a porky mouth ? What ? No ! A little bit, yeah.
 <br>
 Well, there&#39;s only one thing to do.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to put on some lipstick and go apologize to casey.
 <br>
 Fez, you made up all that stuff about the room ! And I want the room, so give it back ! - You give it back ! - You give it back ! - You give it back ! - You give it back ! hi, casey.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Look,  I wanted to talk to you about eric.
 <br>
 Who ? Foreplay.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 Look, I want to know if you can just go ahead and let him get his diploma, because it&#39;s really important to him and  me.
 <br>
 There might be one way I can pass the little guy.
 <br>
 You know, all you gotta do is, you know, just go out with me on a date.
 <br>
 Casey, I&#39;m with eric ! Who ? I&#39;m not saying it again.
 <br>
 Okay, come on, one date ! &#39;Cause I&#39;m still trying to figure out why I ever broke up with a blonde.
 <br>
 I was a redhead then.
 <br>
 Man, I gotta start paying attention.
 <br>
 so get this.
 <br>
 I went down to the gym to talk to casey, and he said that the only way he&#39;d pass you is if I&#39;d go out on a date with him.
 <br>
 What ? Oh, thank you, donna, thank you ! So you&#39;d let me go out with him ? Well, donna, if you really loved me, I mean, you&#39;d date other men.
 <br>
 Get bent ! Now if she really loved me, she&#39;d date other women.
 <br>
 Okay, the competition for who gets the better bedroom is gonna be based on the miss america pageant.
 <br>
 Ooh, I&#39;ll be miss texas.
 <br>
 That bitch always wins.
 <br>
 Okay, the first event is the talent portion of the competition.
 <br>
 okay.
 <br>
 Judges, I present you with a dramatic scene from the major motion picture &#34;the godfather.
 <br>
 &#34; Aah ! there&#39;s an entire horse in my bed ! Why would you do this, godfather ?! Why ?! And then the horse says &#34;let this be a warning.
 <br>
 &#34; The horse doesn&#39;t talk, kelso.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah, I was thinking of &#34;jaws.
 <br>
 &#34; aah, look at my jaws ! Fez, you&#39;re up.
 <br>
 I think we&#39;re gonna give this round to the foreign kid.
 <br>
 I just ran into donna.
 <br>
 Oh, was she on a date with casey ? No, and she doesn&#39;t seem too happy with you.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s so mad.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;ll often find as you go through life that when you try to turn your girlfriend into a prostitute, she gets cranky.
 <br>
 Okay, but, dad, passing P.
 <br>
 E.
 <br>
 Is all that&#39;s standing between me and the rest of my life.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lucky this table is standing between my foot and your ass.
 <br>
 Now you go down there with donna and do a pull-up and earn the respect of that woman who inexplicably loves you ! You know what ? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I gotta do this.
 <br>
 I can do this.
 <br>
 I just gotta be like luke in &#34;star wars.
 <br>
 &#34; I just have to really believe that I can.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I don&#39;t believe I can, so this is nothing like that.
 <br>
 Any tricks to doing a pull-up ? Yes.
 <br>
 You pull up.
 <br>
 Thanks, obi-wan.
 <br>
 E ric, what are we doing here ? You gonna make me sell a kidney so you can pass math ? No, we&#39;re here, because I&#39;m a man, damn it ! Hey, buddy, guess what.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not taking my girlfriend out.
 <br>
 Guess why.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I&#39;m about to pass gym fair and square on the basis of my own strength.
 <br>
 Sidebar.
 <br>
 What are you doing ? I&#39;m doing a pull-up, woman.
 <br>
 Wow, it looks like somebody really had their wheaties this morning.
 <br>
 Actually, I had cocoa puffs, so I&#39;m cuckoo, man, cuckoo ! Donna, stand back, mostly because I&#39;m gonna be kicking my legs a lot.
 <br>
 You can do it, eric.
 <br>
 Never gonna happen, foreplay.
 <br>
 foreplay, foreplay, foreplay ! It&#39;s not &#34;foreplay,&#34; it&#39;s forman ! Eric, you did it ! Wow, congratulations.
 <br>
 So we going out or what ? Look, stay away from my girl, okay, casey kelso ? Or wait, maybe I should say casey smellso.
 <br>
 Smellso ? Wow, that&#39;s really cold, forman.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m just gonna go sign your transcript, &#39;cause I don&#39;t think I want to hang out anymore, okay ? Eric, I am so proud of you.
 <br>
 I&#39;d hug you back, but, well, I can&#39;t move my arms.
 <br>
 We&#39;re back.
 <br>
 I told red he had to fix the very unsanitary thing he did with a pillow in your bathroom.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re gonna have to skip the swimsuit competition, because fez won&#39;t promise not to show us his wee-wee.
 <br>
 So we&#39;re gonna go right into interview.
 <br>
 Each of you will have to answer the question, &#34;why do you deserve the better room ?&#34; Michael, you go first.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Well, judges, you may look in there and see just a room, but I see a place where I can raise my daughter and watch her grow and create memories until the day that I see her walk out that door.
 <br>
 And then through the living room here and out the main door.
 <br>
 oh ! Michael, that&#39;s really beautiful.
 <br>
 Yeah, kelso, real nice.
 <br>
 Let me tell you a story about a young boy who dreamt of one day being in america in a room just like that.
 <br>
 And with a tear in his eye, he said, he said which means, &#34;I want it.
 <br>
 &#34;I want it.
 <br>
 &#34;I want it.
 <br>
 &#34; Well, now I vote they both get the room.
 <br>
 I guess the only way to solve this is a footrace to the room.
 <br>
 Go ! It&#39;s mine ! Ha ha ! I got here first ! The room is mine ! Gross  ! Old people sex ! red, you said you locked the door ! sorry, dudes.
 <br>
 The room&#39;s yours.
 <br>
 You know, I bet we could make it to 200 if that shirt wasn&#39;t weighing you down.
 <br>
 Well, uh, the only way the shirt&#39;s coming off is if I get a kiss from the best-looking lady in point place.
 <br>
 Well, bring it in, dreamboat ! Oh, casey ! &#34;Oh, casey&#34; ? Oh, casey you see by the dawn&#39;s early light I just had the most patriotic dream.
 <br>
