<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Steven, I&#39;m telling you, beards are out.
 <br>
 Look at Malibu Barbie.
 <br>
 She can date anyone she wants.
 <br>
 But she&#39;s with Malibu Ken.
 <br>
 Why? Because Malibu Ken doesn&#39;t have a beard! Yes, he does.
 <br>
 Malibu Barbie&#39;s his beard.
 <br>
 No straight man would wear shorts that tight.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Just shave it off.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like making out with carpet.
 <br>
 Well, here it is- the beginning of the end for you two.
 <br>
 Yeah, I remember the part of our relationship when allJackie did was boss me around.
 <br>
 Yeah, that part only lasted- what, like, six years? And he&#39;s a better man for it.
 <br>
 So come on, Steven.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s shave that beard.
 <br>
 Jackie, you just gave an order in the form of a cheer.
 <br>
 Oh, where are you going? Wherever the beard takes me.
 <br>
 Jackie, sweetie, we just got a phone call, and you&#39;re needed at home.
 <br>
 So why don&#39;t you grab your coat.
 <br>
 Mr.
 <br>
 Forman&#39;ll give you a ride home.
 <br>
 - Do you know what&#39;s going on? - No.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know anything.
 <br>
 I know everything! You know how Jackie&#39;s father is a city councilman? Not anymore.
 <br>
 He just got arrested for bribery.
 <br>
 He could go to prison.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m glad.
 <br>
 That guy makes Republicans look like a bunch of crooks and greedy businessmen.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, thank God for the honest ones like Richard Nixon, huh? Oh, no.
 <br>
 What did you say? I- I said that Nixon was framed, and Kennedy was a commie? That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 What&#39;s with the gun, Trigger? Oh, will you relax, Eric? It&#39;s not a gun.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a BB gun.
 <br>
 Yeah, I lost it when I was, like, 1 0, and I found it this morning buried in my backyard.
 <br>
 Why were you digging in your backyard? Uh, dinosaurs.
 <br>
 Watch the news, Donna! You guys, I can&#39;t believe that Mr.
 <br>
 Burkhart might actually be going to prison.
 <br>
 Ah, the tragedy.
 <br>
 My father was sent to prison and it led to a life of drugs and prostitution.
 <br>
 - What? - Yes.
 <br>
 Then his pimp killed him.
 <br>
 But then the medical examiner found a tiny hair.
 <br>
 And he solved the crime, and he sent the pimp bastard to the chair.
 <br>
 Fez, that was last night&#39;s episode of Quincy.
 <br>
 Oh, I didn&#39;t know you watched that show.
 <br>
 Yeah, this is rough stuff Jackie&#39;s going through.
 <br>
 She&#39;ll come runnin&#39; to me- Old Faithful.
 <br>
 Kelso,Jackie&#39;s with me now.
 <br>
 Maybe.
 <br>
 But we have history.
 <br>
 So when she needs a shoulder to cry on, she&#39;ll rest her head on these broad babies.
 <br>
 Feel &#39;em.
 <br>
 Rock hard, amigo.
 <br>
 Man, you don&#39;t wantJackie leaning on your shoulders.
 <br>
 - They&#39;re all bruised.
 <br>
 - Where? ( Groans ) Man, I should really see those coming by now.
 <br>
 Oh! Watch the gun, Cool Hand Luke.
 <br>
 Will you relax, Eric? God, guns don&#39;t just go off by accident.
 <br>
 Really? Well, what about Eric&#39;s fourth-grade hamster, Snowball? Oh, no, Snowball wasn&#39;t shot.
 <br>
 He went upstate to live with a nice farm family.
 <br>
 You shot Snowball? Well, the gun went off by accident! Oh, sweet pea, I&#39;m here for you.
 <br>
 Steven, my dad&#39;s going to prison.
 <br>
 What am I gonna do? Um, bake him a cake with a file in it? What do you want me to say? Nothing.
 <br>
 Look, I just- Oh, never mind.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;re talking.
 <br>
 Donna, give her a kiss.
 <br>
 ( Rock Group Singing ) ( Ends ) ( Man Shouts Greeting ) Jackie blew right by me to get to Hyde! Yes, I know.
 <br>
 Because you told me 20 times! Oh, there&#39;s my boss, Nina.
 <br>
 Queen of the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 She haunts my dreams.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 I thought Mr.
 <br>
 Roper from Three&#39;s Company haunted your dreams.
 <br>
 Oh, he&#39;s there too.
 <br>
 Bug-eyed bastard.
 <br>
 Look at how beautiful she is.
 <br>
 You have to help me win her heart.
 <br>
 What ever happened toJackie&#39;s heart? At first I thought they were just killing time.
 <br>
 - But Nina- - But now I actually think they&#39;re getting serious.
 <br>
 - But Nina- -Jackie and Hyde- Enough! It&#39;s over for you, pin-brain! Now, to summarize- Jackie gone, Nina still in play.
 <br>
 Now help me do this thing.
 <br>
 Fez.
 <br>
 Nina.
 <br>
 My &#39;&#39;queen-a.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Giggles ) I told you I don&#39;t like that.
 <br>
 Now you&#39;re late for your fingerprint tutorial, so move it.
 <br>
 Whoo, tough cookie.
 <br>
 Yes, Fez likes the hardheaded mamas.
 <br>
 Really? I&#39;m starting to get into the Asian ladies.
 <br>
 I know what you mean.
 <br>
 Mystery of the Orient.
 <br>
 Very sexy.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Donna, what are you doing wearing the engagement ring? It&#39;s supposed to be a secret.
 <br>
 You didn&#39;t tell anyone, did you? Yeah, Eric, I have no self-control, so I told the pretzel guy at the park.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Okay.
 <br>
 Seriously, I have no self-control, and I told the pretzel guy at the park.
 <br>
 - Donna! - I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m excited.
 <br>
 I had to tell someone.
 <br>
 Plus, uh, free pretzel.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong, Steven? Problems with Jackie? Yeah, I said the wrong thing.
 <br>
 Well, I have menopause.
 <br>
 Do you have menopause? Uh, no.
 <br>
 Lucky bastard.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) So tell me what happened.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Well she wanted me to say something to make her feel better, and I couldn&#39;t think of anything.
 <br>
 Well, Steven, you don&#39;t know how to comfort people, because you&#39;ve never been comforted.
 <br>
 No, that&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 One time, my dad felt so bad about missing my Little League game that he made up for it by disappearing for nine years.
 <br>
 Well, after what you&#39;ve been through you don&#39;t have to be nice to anybody.
 <br>
 Jackie can just leave you alone.
 <br>
 Now I&#39;m just- I&#39;m gonna go upstairs and cry a little.
 <br>
 Problems with Jackie, huh? Hyde, I&#39;d like to remind you that Donna and I are basically the perfect couple.
 <br>
 We really are.
 <br>
 So we might just have a little something to teach you about relationships.
 <br>
 We really do.
 <br>
 - All you have to do is back off.
 <br>
 - Go to her.
 <br>
 What? No, he needs to be with her.
 <br>
 No, he needs to give her space.
 <br>
 When your mom left, I gave you space.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t want space.
 <br>
 I wanted you with me.
 <br>
 - You didn&#39;t tell me that.
 <br>
 - I couldn&#39;t find you! And they lived happily ever after.
 <br>
 Fingerprinting is one of the most important jobs at the D.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 V.
 <br>
 , Fez.
 <br>
 It helps make our customers feel like common criminals.
 <br>
 ( Giggling ) See? Firm but gentle.
 <br>
 Repeat that: firm but gentle.
 <br>
 Fir- but ge-ge- ( Sighs ) Your hands are strong.
 <br>
 But your right hand&#39;s much stronger than your left.
 <br>
 Why is that? Um, I am a sword fighter.
 <br>
 You fence? Touch√©.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m- I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m a little short-tempered with you sometimes.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, well, when I see you, I just- No.
 <br>
 No, I can&#39;t.
 <br>
 But- But I am all atwitter.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I just can&#39;t.
 <br>
 And no one can know about this.
 <br>
 But, Mom, Dad&#39;s in trouble.
 <br>
 So I really think you need to come back from Acapulco now.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Wow, that is a lot of tequila.
 <br>
 Red,Jackie&#39;s been moping in our kitchen for an hour.
 <br>
 So call the cops.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t want her arrested.
 <br>
 I want to help her.
 <br>
 She needs a father figure.
 <br>
 Go talk to her.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - Yes! - No.
 <br>
 - Red! Fine.
 <br>
 Every damn argument! You&#39;d think I&#39;d win one, just by chance.
 <br>
 - Mr.
 <br>
 Forman- - Look,Jackie I know that things seem grim, but your father&#39;s rich, right? - Uh-huh.
 <br>
 - Well, then I&#39;m sure that whatever trouble he&#39;s in he&#39;ll buy his way out and wriggle free.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I mean, this is America.
 <br>
 The rich are treated differently here.
 <br>
 Yep.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m so glad I took some shrapnel to make that happen.
 <br>
 Me too.
 <br>
 So, Hyde, have you talked toJackie yet? &#39;Cause don&#39;t- &#39;Cause you gotta give her room to breathe, man.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And if she ever falls out of a plane just let her fall.
 <br>
 What, he&#39;s supposed to just jump out after her? Well, at least they&#39;ll be together.
 <br>
 Man, I don&#39;t getJackie.
 <br>
 I mean, we were together for years and the second I turn my back, she off and Frenches Hyde.
 <br>
 And by &#39;&#39;turn your back,&#39;&#39; you mean ditching her for two months to have sex with random beach trash? Whatever, man.
 <br>
 You- It&#39;s all- It&#39;s all about words with you! Kelso,Jackie&#39;s my girlfriend.
 <br>
 We&#39;re together, so get over it.
 <br>
 - ( Stammering ) Fine! - ( Gunshot ) Dude, you shot him! That is exactly what happened to Snowball! Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 Did I shoot your eye? Yes! Now I can&#39;t see, you moron! You&#39;re dead! - ( Eric ) I&#39;d start running now.
 <br>
 - Chasing me is futile! I&#39;ll just hide in your blind spot! ( Groaning ) - Man, are you okay? - Yeah, I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 The BB just winged my shoulder.
 <br>
 But that kid needs to be taught a lesson.
 <br>
 Hyde, it was an accident.
 <br>
 No, it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 He&#39;s been bitching about me and Jackie since he found out.
 <br>
 Now he got himself so out of control that he shot me.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t like getting shot! So now I&#39;m gonna punish him the way my parents punish me.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna leave him at the mall? No.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna milk this eye thing until he feels as bad as he should.
 <br>
 They didn&#39;t leave me at the mall.
 <br>
 They forgot me.
 <br>
 They were drunk.
 <br>
 -  ( Stereo: Rock ) - I am in pain.
 <br>
 Fez, we&#39;re really sorry about Nina.
 <br>
 You know, rejection hurts.
 <br>
 No, Nina and I were kissing, and she made me stop and now I am in pain.
 <br>
 Ew.
 <br>
 I have to go do something.
 <br>
 ( Door Closes ) I think maybe we&#39;re all getting a little too comfortable with each other.
 <br>
 Well, maybe we wouldn&#39;t be so comfortable if we just gave each other some space.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t make me hit you.
 <br>
 - Well, good luck reaching me through all the space.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Is Hyde here? Hyde? Hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 I brought you this.
 <br>
 What is it? I can&#39;t see.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s most of a burger.
 <br>
 I took a bite, &#39;cause I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m also hungry.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, it&#39;s almost 2:00.
 <br>
 I gotta go flush out my eye.
 <br>
 You guys, how bad is it? Is Hyde gonna be a cyclops? Kelso, what were you thinking? I mean, did you shoot him on purpose? No! The gun went off on accident! Well, he kinda thinks you did.
 <br>
 How could I? I mean, yeah, I was mad.
 <br>
 But I didn&#39;t- I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Maybe I did it accidentally on purpose.
 <br>
 - You mean subconsciously? - No, I was definitely awake the whole time.
 <br>
 Steven, I&#39;m glad your eye&#39;s not hurt.
 <br>
 Even though you deserve it because you were such a jerk about my dad.
 <br>
 Man, look,Jackie- ( Sighs ) I&#39;m never gonna be the guy who says the right thing at the right time.
 <br>
 Okay? I&#39;m just not.
 <br>
 You are so full of it.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m asking for is a gesture, and you can&#39;t even do that.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Okay, I got something.
 <br>
 Get your dad a carton of cigarettes so he can trade &#39;em for not being someone&#39;s wife.
 <br>
 - Oh,just forget it.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Jackie, that&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 Look, when my dad went to prison, that&#39;s what someone told me to make me feel better.
 <br>
 It was my mom! We had a real good laugh! Mr.
 <br>
 and Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, can you settle this for us? If someone you love is kinda depressed should you shower them with kindness or give them space? Well, now, that&#39;s a very good question.
 <br>
 And it really takes a lot of living with someone to get it right.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 - But you&#39;ll find the thing to do is- - Give them space.
 <br>
 - shower them.
 <br>
 What did you say? I said what you said.
 <br>
 You&#39;re lying.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Kitty! When menopause makes you crazy I could be with you all day and it wouldn&#39;t do any good.
 <br>
 You need space.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Menopause makes me crazy? I&#39;m crazy? I&#39;m crazy? Well, if you want space, Red Forman, you got it! This crazy lady&#39;s out the crazy door! We were having a nice lunch.
 <br>
 ( Clattering ) Okay, Hyde, I feel really bad, and I shouldn&#39;t have shot you.
 <br>
 And I think that I might&#39;ve done it on purpose &#39;cause I&#39;m not okay with you and Jackie and I don&#39;t know if I ever will be.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m almost positive that I&#39;ll never, ever shoot you again.
 <br>
 But the only way to be sure is for you to shoot me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve always responded really well to corporal punishment.
 <br>
 So, here.
 <br>
 Do it.
 <br>
 Shoot me.
 <br>
 This is like Old Yeller.
 <br>
 Come on, man.
 <br>
 Just do it.
 <br>
 Right here.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the only way.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 - You lied! - ( Gunshot ) ( Groans ) You&#39;re dead, man! So, how&#39;s stuff with your dad? Well, my mom&#39;s flying home from the Fiesta de las Margaritas so I guess it&#39;s pretty serious.
 <br>
 Wow, that is serious.
 <br>
 Playboy voted Fiesta de las Margaritas Latin America&#39;s number one singles party.
 <br>
 But I- ( Clears Throat ) I&#39;m sure she&#39;s just there for the margaritas.
 <br>
 Oh, my God, you guys, my whole world is just falling apart.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Steven! You shaved your beard off!.
 <br>
 - I thought it might cheer you up.
 <br>
 - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You shaved it off for me.
 <br>
 You let the razor say the words your mouth couldn&#39;t speak.
 <br>
 - ( Together) Aww.
 <br>
 - Shut up! ( Squeals ) So I guess the answer to the problem wasn&#39;t more or less space.
 <br>
 It was more or less hair.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s bizarre.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;ve been thinking about it- about the space thing, and I got it.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll talk about stuff, and I&#39;ll just leave.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ll follow you.
 <br>
 Because I&#39;m strong enough to take you down and make you listen.
 <br>
 And I will let you lie on me and pretend that it bothers me.
 <br>
 Guys, something horrible has happened.
 <br>
 The little man in my pants has turned black.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not funny! Black is the color of death! Oh, my little man is going to die before he gets to see the world.
 <br>
 I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 How could this happen? How? Okay, I washed.
 <br>
 But the ink isn&#39;t coming off my little man.
 <br>
 Help.
 <br>
 You should try bleach.
 <br>
 - Ooh.
 <br>
 Or Comet.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Or steel wool.
 <br>
 Hey, and if all else fails the one thing that gets out ink is more ink.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right, Hyde.
 <br>
 Whatever you do, use the steel wool first.
 <br>
 Really scrub so the soap gets in there.
 <br>
 Remember, if it doesn&#39;t sting, it&#39;s not working.
 <br>
