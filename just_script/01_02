 Does it bother anybody else that these women live in Hooterville? Technically, Petticoat Junction is down the track from Hooterville.
 <br>
 Okay, does it bother anybody else that they live down the track from Hooterville? It bothers me that they bathe in the town water tank.
 <br>
 With the dog.
 <br>
 It isn&#39;t the drinking water.
 <br>
 It is the water for the train.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s still three naked women with a dog.
 <br>
 - I want to be the Hooterville dog.
 <br>
 Yoo-hoo! Coming down.
 <br>
 Now don&#39;t mind me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just putting some clothes in.
 <br>
 Eric, honey I thought you could wear this on your birthday.
 <br>
 It&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 You look so handsome in it.
 <br>
 Why would I want to dress nice on my birthday? It&#39;s your birthday? You never know what&#39;s going to happen on your birthday.
 <br>
 Mom, do not throw a party for me.
 <br>
 Listen to Mr.
 <br>
 Popularity.
 <br>
 Like I have time to plan you a party.
 <br>
 By the way your sister Laurie&#39;s coming home from college for the weekend.
 <br>
 No special reason.
 <br>
 She just is.
 <br>
 You&#39;re getting a party.
 <br>
 And best of all, it&#39;s a surprise.
 <br>
 I just realized, Donna&#39;s older than you.
 <br>
 - Only by a month.
 <br>
 - Good for you, Eric.
 <br>
 - Good for me, what? - In my country it is good luck to fall in love with an older woman.
 <br>
 - Fez? - No, they come with livestock.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! - Morning.
 <br>
 - Morning.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 Did I just see about seven bags of potato chips in there? They were on sale.
 <br>
 Please, don&#39;t throw me a party.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not throwing a party.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t give him one.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 - He&#39;s too old for a surprise party.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m agreeing with you.
 <br>
 - Then stop yelling.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m not yelling.
 <br>
 Look, I know money is tight, so I don&#39;t want a big birthday.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll decide when money is tight.
 <br>
 Now, what kind of gift do you want? Don&#39;t worry about the cost.
 <br>
 As long as it&#39;s reasonable.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I would like a cassette player for the car.
 <br>
 A cassette.
 <br>
 Not an eight-track.
 <br>
 No eight-track, okay? You know, I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t just put record players in cars.
 <br>
 The point is, I don&#39;t want an eight-track tape player.
 <br>
 - Then you won&#39;t get one.
 <br>
 - But, honey, he wants one.
 <br>
 No, I want a tape player, just not an eight-track.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll get a Delco.
 <br>
 A genuine GM part for your genuine GM car.
 <br>
 It doesn&#39;t have to be a Delco.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just for music.
 <br>
 See, now there&#39;s your first mistake.
 <br>
 Parts have to be compatible, Eric.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not burning cheap gas in that car, are you? No, sir.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going out.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 I want you to run to the store for me.
 <br>
 Get a large can of frosting and 15 small bags of M&amp;M&#39;s.
 <br>
 Plain, not peanuts.
 <br>
 They&#39;re for your sister.
 <br>
 That was close.
 <br>
 - So? - What? What are you going to get Eric for his birthday? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Nothing seems right.
 <br>
 I want to give him something special.
 <br>
 He kissed you! Get in the car.
 <br>
 Donna, get in the car so we can talk.
 <br>
 Okay, what happened? Jackie, I&#39;m not gonna talk to you about this.
 <br>
 Then who are you gonna talk to? Okay, we get home from the Rundgren Concert and I&#39;m sitting on the hood of the car, and I kissed him.
 <br>
 French or American? I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m talking to you about this.
 <br>
 Guys, no.
 <br>
 Okay, so Look, I&#39;ve lived next door to Eric my entire life and we talk about everything together.
 <br>
 We love the same music, we love the Packers.
 <br>
 Then I kissed him, and everything changed.
 <br>
 Now I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s my boyfriend or best friend.
 <br>
 If he&#39;s my boyfriend, I&#39;d lose my best friend.
 <br>
 If I screw it up, I lose both.
 <br>
 Now I have to get him this gift and I don&#39;t know Donna! I&#39;ve solved it.
 <br>
 Get him a scented candle.
 <br>
 A scented candle? It&#39;s practical and romantic.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey! I have the ball last.
 <br>
 I win.
 <br>
 No, you didn&#39;t win.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 I had the ball last and Holy Mother.
 <br>
 Hello, Laurie.
 <br>
 Hello, Kelso.
 <br>
 Hyde.
 <br>
 Who is the goddess? The goddess is Eric&#39;s sister.
 <br>
 She&#39;s not a goddess.
 <br>
 She&#39;s more the earth mother whore type, which works for me.
 <br>
 - Laurie.
 <br>
 - Eric.
 <br>
 Shouldn&#39;t you put some clothes on? Why? Aren&#39;t you a little cold? - No, in fact, I&#39;m hot.
 <br>
 - Then why don&#39;t you go upstairs? I am waiting for my jeans to come out of the dryer.
 <br>
 And I want you to stay off my case.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll only take me a minute.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think Kelso&#39;s gonna last that long.
 <br>
 Too bad.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like I&#39;m completely naked under this.
 <br>
 I&#39;m wearing underwear.
 <br>
 See? If we were at the beach, you wouldn&#39;t even notice me.
 <br>
 If we were at the beach, Kelso would be in the water right now.
 <br>
 So, I understand you have the wagon now.
 <br>
 I want to borrow it tomorrow night.
 <br>
 I need it.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 But I need a favor.
 <br>
 - For you? I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Look, just tell Mom I&#39;m too old for surprise parties.
 <br>
 But you&#39;re the baby, and Mama loves her baby.
 <br>
 If you do it, you can borrow the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 - All night.
 <br>
 - All night? Fine.
 <br>
 Then, it&#39;s a deal, baby.
 <br>
 Your sister wants me.
 <br>
 I mean, you saw her coming on to me, right? Let him go.
 <br>
 Remember? I said, &#34;Hello, Laurie.
 <br>
 &#34; And Laurie said Hello, Kelso.
 <br>
 I&#39;m waiting and I want you.
 <br>
 Baby.
 <br>
 Take me now.
 <br>
 I need it bad.
 <br>
 I need it all night.
 <br>
 And Mama loves her baby.
 <br>
 I&#39;m completely naked under this.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m hot for you, Kelso.
 <br>
 What? You didn&#39;t see it? Get out of the yard! So, how&#39;s your friend Janice? Pregnant.
 <br>
 She was such a nice girl.
 <br>
 How does that happen? First the egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus where it attaches to the wall.
 <br>
 Eric, for God&#39;s sakes, that&#39;s no language for a woman to hear.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay, Red.
 <br>
 I know what a fallopian tube is.
 <br>
 I think Mom does, too.
 <br>
 I just don&#39;t like my little boy bandying those words about.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still my baby.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mom.
 <br>
 Laurie? Quit staring at your sister and eat your carrots.
 <br>
 Yeah, Eric wanted me to tell you that he thinks he&#39;s too old for a party.
 <br>
 Keys.
 <br>
 There&#39;s no party.
 <br>
 Laurie, loose lips.
 <br>
 Laurie, I just remembered: I can&#39;t loan you the Vista Cruiser on account of I hate you.
 <br>
 Laurie, you&#39;re not driving the Vista Cruiser.
 <br>
 It&#39;s old and undependable.
 <br>
 It could break down and you&#39;d be at the mercy of any maniac who came along.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay for Eric, but you&#39;re taking the Toyota.
 <br>
 And here&#39;s $20.
 <br>
 Will that cover gas? It should.
 <br>
 Honey, give her another $10, just in case.
 <br>
 You know, I could probably use some gas money.
 <br>
 Yeah, and if a frog had wings, he wouldn&#39;t bump his ass when he hops.
 <br>
 Coming.
 <br>
 I&#39;m coming.
 <br>
 Donna? Donna, it&#39;s 3:00 a.
 <br>
 m.
 <br>
 Are you crazy? Crazy? Crazy in love with you.
 <br>
 What is it about you that drives me wild with passion and desire? I am 17 now.
 <br>
 Shut up, and sit down.
 <br>
 I have to give you your birthday present.
 <br>
 It can&#39;t wait any longer.
 <br>
 Close your eyes.
 <br>
 This is my birthday present? No, that&#39;s my nightgown.
 <br>
 I&#39;m your present.
 <br>
 Open your eyes, birthday boy.
 <br>
 Surprise! Birthday breakfast.
 <br>
 And this is it, young man.
 <br>
 A few gifts tonight, the end.
 <br>
 And it is too late to change your mind about a party now.
 <br>
 So don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting one or you will be sorely disappointed.
 <br>
 Happy birthday.
 <br>
 You know, the lawn&#39;s not gonna cut itself.
 <br>
 Thanks, Mom, Dad.
 <br>
 Hey, little brother.
 <br>
 Nice tent.
 <br>
 Look, I know what you&#39;re all doing here.
 <br>
 What are you talking about, Eric? We&#39;re just hanging out.
 <br>
 Like always.
 <br>
 Except we&#39;re dressed nice.
 <br>
 But that doesn&#39;t mean anything.
 <br>
 Hi, kids.
 <br>
 I need your help with something.
 <br>
 Jackie, Donna, Michael, Steven young man with an accent, could you give me a hand? Not you, Eric.
 <br>
 God, I can&#39;t take it.
 <br>
 But I No.
 <br>
 No, I No.
 <br>
 Eric? Eric, honey.
 <br>
 Honey, could you come up here for a second? Shut up.
 <br>
 He&#39;s coming.
 <br>
 Surprise! Wow! I mean, yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s an eight-track tape player.
 <br>
 - I see that.
 <br>
 - Just what you asked for.
 <br>
 You made such a big deal about it, I wrote it down.
 <br>
 - Cassettes.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Thanks, Hyde.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re welcome.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s put them in the eight-track and play them.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a hot-shave dispenser.
 <br>
 He won&#39;t need that for a long time.
 <br>
 - A long time.
 <br>
 - Of course he will.
 <br>
 He&#39;s almost like a man.
 <br>
 - I got you something.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Donna, help me find my purse.
 <br>
 Now.
 <br>
 Jackie, you didn&#39;t even bring a purse.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t give him your present in front of his guy friends.
 <br>
 I am one of his guy friends.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, I have put a lot of thought into this gift.
 <br>
 Please do not wreck this for me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I guess I was being selfish.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Okay, it&#39;s time we disappeared.
 <br>
 - What? Honey, the party just started.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s why we&#39;re going over to Bob&#39;s.
 <br>
 - I wanted to give Eric a party.
 <br>
 - And you did.
 <br>
 You make a mess, you&#39;re all grounded.
 <br>
 You darn kids.
 <br>
 You know, what if they run out of ketchup or something.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 We have more buns and sweet pickles if you don&#39;t like the dill.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;d love to stay, but I&#39;m leaving.
 <br>
 Buy us some beers? We&#39;ll pay double.
 <br>
 Do you really think that beer will make your little party better? Yes.
 <br>
 I admit it would give you young people a sense of maturity but it would be a false maturity, and that would be wrong.
 <br>
 - So you&#39;re not going to do it? - Of course not.
 <br>
 Now, I&#39;m going off to join my legal friends at a party with a keg.
 <br>
 Bye.
 <br>
 So, Laurie where&#39;s the party? You know, maybe we&#39;ll cruise by later.
 <br>
 In your dreams, you idiot.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys had to see that.
 <br>
 Three fours, I need them.
 <br>
 Bob is very good at Yahtzee.
 <br>
 - The liquor cabinet.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s locked.
 <br>
 - What if there&#39;s an emergency? - They&#39;ll call.
 <br>
 - What if they run out of chips? - They&#39;ll starve.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna fix myself a Tom Collins.
 <br>
 Red? No, Kitty needs one.
 <br>
 I am just so worried.
 <br>
 - My lord.
 <br>
 Laurie&#39;s leaving.
 <br>
 - Honey, she&#39;s in college.
 <br>
 She doesn&#39;t want to hang around with them.
 <br>
 Maybe I should make a call, just in case Kitty, what could happen? What could happen? Plenty could happen.
 <br>
 Plenty.
 <br>
 Now that the adults are gone, we can be as bad as we want.
 <br>
 Who wants to give Eric a venereal disease? Look.
 <br>
 Coasters.
 <br>
 Forget coasters! Please, fellas my mom put out coasters for a reason.
 <br>
 I think I&#39;m gonna put my drink directly on the furniture.
 <br>
 That way, it will leave a ring.
 <br>
 No! Why didn&#39;t I beg my mother to stay? Quiet, you silly American.
 <br>
 I am making a long distance call on your parents&#39;phone.
 <br>
 But that&#39;s immoral.
 <br>
 In my country of Wherever it is I am from, I can never tell.
 <br>
 Morals get in the way of a good dirty time.
 <br>
 But first, I need to eat some chips.
 <br>
 What? Out of chips? Now I am mad.
 <br>
 I must shoot something.
 <br>
 Not the littlest hobo! Why? You&#39;re over-reacting.
 <br>
 Kitty, when Valerie went off to school, I felt the same way but this little book of poems helped me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called, &#34;Verses from an empty nest.
 <br>
 &#34; Read her that one about the little bird that lost its way.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 &#34;The little bird that once did sing &#34;is now alone with broken wing&#34; God.
 <br>
 Yep, that sounds nice.
 <br>
 - I need a refill.
 <br>
 - But, honey, usually you only drink one.
 <br>
 Tonight I&#39;m having two.
 <br>
 - Wait on the porch, and I&#39;ll get Eric.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s dark out there.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re giving him a candle.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - Here, matches.
 <br>
 - He might not want to light it.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t say that.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t even think it.
 <br>
 Now, when he opens it, he&#39;ll say cool or something.
 <br>
 And then you give him a look like this.
 <br>
 - So, what did you get from Donna? - Nothing, yet.
 <br>
 Maybe it&#39;s the big gift.
 <br>
 You know, the really big gift.
 <br>
 You guys know what I&#39;m saying when I say, &#34;the big gift,&#34; right? Yeah, we got it.
 <br>
 And we got it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not even from here and I got it.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s on the porch.
 <br>
 He&#39;s getting the big gift! - A sand candle.
 <br>
 This is very cool.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s nothing.
 <br>
 - Are you okay? - I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause you had a look like you might be sick or something.
 <br>
 I am just being completely stupid.
 <br>
 That&#39;s my job.
 <br>
 - I was worried about the gift.
 <br>
 - Why? This is a very cool gift.
 <br>
 - I&#39;d light it if I had matches.
 <br>
 - Here.
 <br>
 You thought of everything.
 <br>
 Happy birthday.
 <br>
 Look at this.
 <br>
 We never thought to put a candle out here.
 <br>
 It is just so romantic.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s keep moving.
 <br>
 There&#39;s nothing to see out here.
 <br>
 Thanks, Dad.
 <br>
 We have candles in the bedroom, don&#39;t we? This is it.
 <br>
 He&#39;s going for it.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s his birthday, she should kiss him first.
 <br>
 - She did last time.
 <br>
 - What? - Nothing.
 <br>
 Shut up and watch.
 <br>
 Come on, Forman, go for it.
 <br>
 The door&#39;s open, we can hear you.
 <br>
 We can see you.
 <br>
 Is he kissing her? None of us can see them, Fez.
 <br>
 Eric, are you kissing her?
 <br>
