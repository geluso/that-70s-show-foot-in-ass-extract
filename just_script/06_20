<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 You know, before we decided not to have sex.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you decided.
 <br>
 I&#39;m ready.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 I decided.
 <br>
 Movies were just a dark place to fool around before we went home and did it, but now we can really watch the movie.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that great? It&#39;s fabulous.
 <br>
 I mean, there&#39;s nothing I hate more than the feeling that I&#39;m about to have sex.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Hi! Hey! Hi! Okay.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that the girl who sells slurpees? Why is she saying &#34;hi&#34; to you? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never talked to her before.
 <br>
 I mean, maybe one time I said, &#34;you&#39;re out of spoon straws,&#34; but that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 great.
 <br>
 Now I have to sit through &#34;Kramer vs.
 <br>
 Kramer&#34; again with no shot at nookie.
 <br>
 First time we saw it, I said, &#34;you know, dads can be good parents, too,&#34; and Donna&#39;s shirt just floated off.
 <br>
 what is wrong with me? A boy&#39;s gonna lose his mother, and all I can think about is fooling around.
 <br>
 I am such a dirty girl.
 <br>
 I should be spanked.
 <br>
 Ooh, stop it! Screw it.
 <br>
 Sneak attack is my only hope.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go with the yawn and grab.
 <br>
 Watch out for my hand, pretty mama, &#39;cause I&#39;m not really tired.
 <br>
 Oh, god.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the yawn and grab.
 <br>
 How do I stop it? Oops! Oh, sorry.
 <br>
 Oh, come on.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Now my lap&#39;s covered in hot buttered popcorn.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the most action I&#39;ve gotten in weeks.
 <br>
 Oh, thanks for helping move Pam into my house, Kitty.
 <br>
 You know what they say lady number three&#39;s a charm.
 <br>
 You have been so warm and friendly.
 <br>
 You simply must teach me how to be like that.
 <br>
 Pam, I&#39;d just like to say on behalf of Fez and myself, that it is a privilege and a turn-on to carry your underthings.
 <br>
 And you don&#39;t have to pay me.
 <br>
 I took a few souvenirs.
 <br>
 Well, enjoy.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, I&#39;d help you with the boxes, but I don&#39;t want to tire myself out.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna be up all night welcoming Pam to the house.
 <br>
 Okay, see you later.
 <br>
 Have fun.
 <br>
 Close your shades.
 <br>
 What do we do with these boxes? Let&#39;s just stick &#39;em in there.
 <br>
 Hi, boys.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s Show - Saison 6 - Episode 20 &#34;Squeezebox&#34; Mitch, what are you doing here? Oh, I made a peach cobbler for Donna, and I forgot to leave it when I was in here last night.
 <br>
 You weren&#39;t in here last night.
 <br>
 Well, not as far as you know.
 <br>
 Okay, look, Mitch, I know you&#39;re in love with her, but it&#39;s not gonna work out.
 <br>
 You&#39;re as big as you&#39;re gonna get.
 <br>
 And trust me, okay? Donna&#39;s still growing.
 <br>
 Jackie, we need to talk.
 <br>
 Eric and I came really close to doing it, and I am so jacked-up on hormones, I feel like I could jump the first guy I see.
 <br>
 Then look my way, pretty lady.
 <br>
 Okay, Mitch, you know I love having you around &#39;cause you say really nice things about me.
 <br>
 Like how the sun pales in radiance to the beauty of your smile? - Yeah, like that.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 But I have to talk to Jackie, and it&#39;s girl stuff.
 <br>
 Oh, you&#39;re so strong.
 <br>
 You make me feel like Jessica Lange in &#34;King Kong.
 <br>
 &#34; Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Hi, boys.
 <br>
 I could kill you without making a sound.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;m worried we don&#39;t have enough chicken for dinner tonight.
 <br>
 Do these breasts look big enough? I&#39;m not comfortable with that question.
 <br>
 - What? - What? What? what are you laughing at? Just life.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a hoot.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in that orange juice, but I&#39;m gonna pour myself a glass.
 <br>
 - Red, what I want to know is, what did Pam mean?       - Not here Toyota.
 <br>
 This is the only place that&#39;s safe.
 <br>
 Look, if I was a single man, what we saw today would be, like, a reward for a life time of disappointments.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 So it&#39;s just another disappointment.
 <br>
 For you, maybe.
 <br>
 I saw &#39;em.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care who knows it.
 <br>
 You better care, &#39;cause if Kitty finds out, I&#39;m taking you down with me.
 <br>
 And when I take people down, they stay down.
 <br>
 Just ask North Korea.
 <br>
 But I have so many questions.
 <br>
 I mean, I&#39;ve been flashed before.
 <br>
 But it was always followed with either, &#34;get out!&#34; Or &#34;there&#39;s a 2-drink minimum,&#34; but, &#34;hi, boys&#34;? It has me reeling.
 <br>
 Oh, maybe she was coming on to us.
 <br>
 She wasn&#39;t coming onto us.
 <br>
 She was coming onto me.
 <br>
 She heard about my war record.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a hero.
 <br>
 You know why Darth Vader went to the dark side? He was dating a redhead who wouldn&#39;t put out.
 <br>
 So you are like Darth Vader in the sense that you&#39;re not getting any.
 <br>
 But you are not like Darth Vader in the sense that you are weak and strike fin no one.
 <br>
 Well, this is certainly one way to spend an afternoon.
 <br>
 I never really got into making models.
 <br>
 Guess I was too busy having sex.
 <br>
 Hey, I don&#39;t have sex, and I still don&#39;t build models.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t have a single model or a single girl.
 <br>
 My life is an empty hole.
 <br>
 Hey, nice job.
 <br>
 You put the force field generators on backwards.
 <br>
 One photon torpedo, and you&#39;re space toast.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I think we should have sex.
 <br>
 - Yes! - No! Okay, I&#39;m going crazy not being with you.
 <br>
 You may not be a strong man, but you read my body like braille.
 <br>
 Burn! Wait.
 <br>
 W-what&#39;s &#34;braille&#34;? you two were awfully quiet at dinner tonight.
 <br>
 Is there anything I should know about? - No.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll get it.
 <br>
 - Me too.
 <br>
 Hi, boys.
 <br>
 oh, Kitty, every time I come to this house I&#39;m amazed by how much you&#39;ve done with so little.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 We brought Kahl√∫a.
 <br>
 Well, aren&#39;t you just an angel sent from after-dinner drink heaven? She wanted to get you cookies, but I know how much you like the sauce.
 <br>
 - Red - Toyota! Did you see that look she just gave us? Was that, &#34;please don&#39;t tell anyone you saw my boobs&#34;? Or, &#34;please come over and see my boobs again&#34;? Do you have to keep saying that word? Let&#39;s just call them &#34;them.
 <br>
 &#34; This is the last time we ever talk about it.
 <br>
 From here on out, it never happened.
 <br>
 - But, Red-- - Steven, I have been to war.
 <br>
 I have seen a lot of things in my life.
 <br>
 And there only three things that I was gonna keep secret until the day I die.
 <br>
 This is number four.
 <br>
 And five.
 <br>
 Okay, the tractor beam is operational.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t get too close.
 <br>
 You really gonna shine your love light on that? Well, he&#39;s a different person between the sheets.
 <br>
 What can I say? Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Hey, listen, tomorrow I have this police test on interrogation techniques.
 <br>
 I was wondering if I could practice on somebody.
 <br>
 Jackie, how about you? Oh, well, no.
 <br>
 This is your first time.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna need somebody much more spineless than me.
 <br>
 Try Eric.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s good thinking.
 <br>
 All right, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, if that is indeed your real name what did you do on the day of yesterday? You&#39;ll never get it out of me, copper.
 <br>
 I&#39;m no rat! Kelso, what the hell?! Oh, just relax, Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just doing good cop/bad cop.
 <br>
 That was the bad cop, but he&#39;s gone now.
 <br>
 See, now good cop is here to take care of you.
 <br>
 Hey, how you doin&#39;, buddy? It&#39;s a real shame about what happened to your model.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t you tell me what you did yesterday? I came home from the restaurant and spent six hours building that model! Uh, excuse me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, but what about your encounter at the store with the girl who sells slurpees? What? Yeah, you remember.
 <br>
 She asked why you never call her anymore.
 <br>
 You were like ooh.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Is that the girl from the movies? Donna, I&#39;m asking the questions here.
 <br>
 Was that the girl from the movies? What happened to, &#34;I barely know her&#34;? What happened to, &#34;I barely know her&#34;? Why were you calling her, Eric? - Why were you calling her, Eric? - Kelso, will you shut up?! Oh, yeah, it&#39;s getting hot in here, isn&#39;t it?! Look, Donna maybe I kinda know her.
 <br>
 Maybe we kinda went out a couple times when you were dating Kelso&#39;s brother Wait.
 <br>
 You got other girls besides Donna to go out with you? What is this obsession with the underdog? So the other day at the movies you lied to me? Donna, I am the senior officer here.
 <br>
 So the other day at the movies you lied to me.
 <br>
 No, I you know, I mean, it was the movies, you know? It&#39;s all make-believe.
 <br>
 Okay, you know what? Don&#39;t bother coming over tonight.
 <br>
 My sexual tension has been replaced with another familiar emotion-- anger at your scrawny ass! - No! - Yes! Well, good job, Michael.
 <br>
 You solved one crime and prevented an even bigger one Donna having sex with Eric.
 <br>
 You have the right to remain burn! I&#39;m just glad I could help the truth be told.
 <br>
 Yeah, at least someone&#39;s being honest around here.
 <br>
 Mitch, what the hell? What.
 <br>
 I thought you came off looking great.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 That was me.
 <br>
 everyone, I want to thank you for making me so welcome.
 <br>
 I feel like the only guest at an inexpensive backwoods hotel.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;re so tense.
 <br>
 Of course he&#39;s tense,mom.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the one who taught me that if your man&#39;s not tense when you walking to the room,  that means you&#39;re doing something wrong.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m tense because of you, &#39;cause you&#39;re.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 too pretty.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, I was gonna get you a thank you gift for helping with the move, but then I figured, nah.
 <br>
 So thanks.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t mention it, Bob.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t mention anything about that day ever again.
 <br>
 Why? It was a pretty good day.
 <br>
 Nothing got broken.
 <br>
 Nobody got hurt.
 <br>
 You two even got to see Pam topless.
 <br>
 Yeah, first time I saw &#39;em, I was speechless, too.
 <br>
 Alright.
 <br>
 I admit that we saw Pam&#39;s them.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s not like we planned it.
 <br>
 Although our timing couldn&#39;t have been better.
 <br>
 Oh, I think you mean &#34;worse,&#34; Steven.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m pretty sure I meant &#34;better.
 <br>
 &#34; Red, how could you? Kitty, we just opened the door, and there she was what was I supposed to do, rip the eyes out of my head? Don&#39;t feel bad, you guys.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t the first time my body has caused a fight.
 <br>
 One time I caused a riot on a topless beach in Venezuela.
 <br>
 Imagine what you saw, only all tanned and oiled.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 She told me to.
 <br>
 Well hate to let the cat out of the bag and then leave, but looks like that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re gonna do.
 <br>
 Enjoy your fight I can&#39;t believe you saw my mother topless and didn&#39;t tell me about it right away.
 <br>
 What, so every time I see another woman&#39;s breasts I&#39;m supposed to tell you? Now I know.
 <br>
 I am so mad.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t even stand to look at you.
 <br>
 And yet you do.
 <br>
 Because your eyes work.
 <br>
 You see my problem? All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Eric lied to me about that girl.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;re getting married.
 <br>
 I should know everything about him.
 <br>
 If I have to know that he wore a bathing suit in the tub until he was 12 yeah, tell everybody.
 <br>
 I should know who he dated.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Just get it off your chest, Donna.
 <br>
 all the rage and the anger and the clothing.
 <br>
 Hey, Hey, Hey there&#39;s only room for one creepy pervert in this group, and that&#39;s me.
 <br>
 Around here, i&#39;m the one who drools over all the ladies.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t drool over all the ladies, just Donna.
 <br>
 A specialist, ha? Ok we&#39;ll try it your way.
 <br>
 Oh my god.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t think Eric and that girl.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Made sweet emotional love? Yes, I do.
 <br>
 Bought many a slurpee from her.
 <br>
 And from what I can tell, she&#39;ll do it with anyone Did she do it with you? No, she has way too much self-respect for that.
 <br>
 I am gonna march right in that room and tell my mother there are consequences on her topless actions.
 <br>
 And that she needs to start wearing pantyhose.
 <br>
 This isn&#39;t Las Vegas.
 <br>
 Oopsy Doosy So then she goes, &#34;Hi, Boys&#34; I mean, that has to be a &#34;come on&#34;, right? saw this dirty movie once where the plumbers knock on the door and the lady answers, and says &#34;hi, boys&#34; after that, it was all asses and elbows.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I&#39;m sorry, Hyde.
 <br>
 There&#39;s a lot of guys that Pam would choose before you and Red All right, it goes &#34;me&#34; then Bob Fez, then you Red, then me again Then Donna, then Eric.
 <br>
 Okay, Eric, there&#39;s something I need to know.
 <br>
 Did you or did you not do it with the slurpee slut? What? He answered a question with a question.
 <br>
 That means he&#39;s guilty.
 <br>
 Now let&#39;s ditch him and carry me out of here.
 <br>
 Donna, I did not sleep with her.
 <br>
 Well, you lied to met about her before, so why should I believe you now? You don&#39;t believe me? Fine.
 <br>
 Let me show you what I was doing while you were with Casey.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna hide in your bedroom and cry? Or you gonna try to write a song again? Hey guys, what rimes with &#34;pain&#34;? I loved that song Everyday is like rain when you&#39;re in pain.
 <br>
 Ok, Donna This is is a box full of model that I made while you were with Casey Kelso.
 <br>
 Look at this : Tie Fighters, assault vehicules and troop transports all with minor defects in workmanship.
 <br>
 Ye he made these, all right.
 <br>
 So this is what you did when we were apart? Oh my horny nerd boy Donna, there&#39;s a reason I didn&#39;t tell you about her.
 <br>
 She wasn&#39;t important.
 <br>
 The whole time we broke up.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you know you know I never stopped loving you.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Hyde, I never stopped loving you, either.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t.
 <br>
 I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t cry.
 <br>
 You guys better be kidding, or I&#39;m gonna be super pissed.
 <br>
 So can I suggest that we honor the age-old tradition of making up after a fight, not just spiritually, but physically? How about a brand-spanking-new tradition where I buy you a milkshake and a &#34;playboy&#34;? Donna, whoa.
 <br>
 I&#39;m insulted.
 <br>
 I do not need a milkshake.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 So they&#39;re back together and everything&#39;s fine? That sucks.
 <br>
 See what happens when you specialize? I can go and make any number of ladies uncomfortable.
 <br>
 What can you do? what do you think he meant by, &#34;whoopsy doozy&#34;? Not here.
 <br>
 Toyota! Oh, I&#39;m so freaked out, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna have to sleep with the light on.
 <br>
 What are you two doing out here? We--we were just uh-oh!
 <br>
