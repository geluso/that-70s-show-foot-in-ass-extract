 What are you watching? Gilligan is on.
 <br>

 <br>
 - She lives right next door.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Donna, about tomorrow night.
 <br>
 I was thinking that maybe you and I could go out to dinner.
 <br>
 - For Valentine&#39;s Day? - Hyde asked me to study at the library.
 <br>
 I mean, you can do that anytime, right? Yeah, I&#39;d love to go.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 So then it&#39;s a date.
 <br>
 Our first.
 <br>
 Yeah, if you don&#39;t count all the times I mauled you.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Which I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 So Hey, guys.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s going on? I&#39;ll talk to you guys later.

 <br>
 Really? No.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going out to dinner tomorrow night.
 <br>
 For Valentine&#39;s Day.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Donna and I are going to the library to study tomorrow night.
 <br>
 On Valentine&#39;s Day? Who studies on Valentine&#39;s Day? I didn&#39;t know it was Valentine&#39;s Day when I made the date.
 <br>
 To study.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sure she just forgot about you.
 <br>
 We just talked about it a minute ago.
 <br>
 Women.
 <br>
 You know, I mean Anyway, I&#39;m gonna give Donna my class ring.
 <br>
 No, forget rings.
 <br>
 You wanna score with Donna, use my super funk eight-track.
 <br>
 Anyway, I figure it&#39;s time to make it official.
 <br>
 She&#39;s just been waiting for any jerk to swoop down on her.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re that jerk.
 <br>
 Better me than some other jerk.
 <br>
 Why are you looking at me? Hyde is the other jerk.
 <br>
 Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin! So, if Eric and Donna are going out Saturday night that means we have no wheels.
 <br>
 I can borrow my dad&#39;s car.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a Lincoln.
 <br>
 Leather.
 <br>
 You know what we should do? We should ditch Hyde and Fez and make out in the backseat.
 <br>
 You said that out loud.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 We can go shopping for clogs.
 <br>
 Pick me up at 7:00.
 <br>
 Have fun, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m out.
 <br>
 We won&#39;t be shopping.
 <br>
 We&#39;ll be doing it.
 <br>
 Again.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause that&#39;s what we do.
 <br>
 We do it! Then I&#39;m in.
 <br>
 No, you&#39;re not invited, Fez.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;m out.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, later.
 <br>
 It looks like it&#39;s just you and me, little buddy.
 <br>
 Yeah, Fez.
 <br>
 Which is really wrong, man &#39;cause I had plans with Donna.
 <br>
 Until Forman snaked me.
 <br>
 Who would have thought she would rather go to a nice restaurant than a smelly, old library? You will laugh later.
 <br>
 So, let me see.
 <br>
 Go ahead, show your mother.
 <br>
 Oh, my gosh, that is snazzy.
 <br>
 That is a snazzy jacket.
 <br>
 Damn good thing I went with him.
 <br>
 He wanted to buy a leisure suit.
 <br>
 Come on, Dad.
 <br>
 Leisure suits are cool.
 <br>
 Everybody wears them.
 <br>
 Leisure suits are for dumbasses.
 <br>
 Believe me.
 <br>
 Hey, there, Eric.
 <br>
 Looking sharp for your big date? Who knew our two little tykes would grow up to be dating.
 <br>
 Oh, no.

 Let&#39;s have dinner tomorrow night.
 <br>
 Just the parents.
 <br>

 We can plan a big wedding.
 <br>
 I know you&#39;re joking.
 <br>
 But could you please stop? Please? You know, I&#39;ve You can borrow our car.
 <br>
 Girls love corsages.
 <br>
 They got a fried onion brick at The Vineyard, right? I don&#39;t believe you, Michael.
 <br>
 What? You can&#39;t just maul me in front of my father.
 <br>
 I bet he didn&#39;t even notice.
 <br>
 He yelled at you to stop it.
 <br>
 I thought he was talking to you.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Michael, we have a problem.
 <br>
 Ever since we Did it? Can you please use a more beautiful term? Like what? Like, proved our love.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 But &#34;did it&#34; sounds so much cooler.
 <br>
 Okay, just take me to the mall.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not really going shopping, are we? Yes, I need clogs.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 God darn! That is a snazzy jacket.
 <br>

 <br>
 Brown is your color.
 <br>
 Thanks, Dad.
 <br>
 No, Mom.
 <br>
 Let me tell you something, order the dinner.
 <br>
 A la carte&#39;s a sucker&#39;s bet.
 <br>
 And remember pull the chair out for her.
 <br>
 The small fork is for the salad.
 <br>
 And this jacket&#39;s gotta last you all the way through college so don&#39;t spill any crap on it.
 <br>
 Here you go.
 <br>
 Have fun.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 - Shall we? - Good God, yes.
 <br>
 Smile.
 <br>
 Now, if she gets to do it, I get to do it.
 <br>
 Kitty, he&#39;s leaving.
 <br>
 Talk about pressure.
 <br>
 Yeah, I mean, this is a huge deal.
 <br>
 To our parents.
 <br>
 So what do you wanna do? I don&#39;t know, man.
 <br>
 What do you want to do? Let&#39;s go to The Hub.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve got my eye on this plump girl.
 <br>
 Sounds good, man, but I&#39;ll pass.
 <br>
 Poor Hyde.
 <br>
 What? You love Donna, and she&#39;s with your good friend Eric.
 <br>
 And? And that&#39;s the oldest story in the world.
 <br>
 And a sad one at that.
 <br>
 You know what, man? I had a chance, and I didn&#39;t take it.
 <br>
 And once Forman gives her that ring, man, they&#39;re going out.
 <br>
 And it would be really scummy to hit on her then.
 <br>
 Not that I wouldn&#39;t do it.
 <br>
 It&#39;d just be really scummy.
 <br>
 If you don&#39;t tell Donna how you feel, then you will regret it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going to The Vineyard.
 <br>
 Good for you.
 <br>
 Just don&#39;t tell Eric what I said because I really like his basement.
 <br>
 This is quite a menu.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You got enough money? Yeah, for me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Were you gonna eat something, too? Actually, I&#39;m in the mood for chicken.
 <br>
 What a coincidence.
 <br>
 I, too, am ordering the cheapest thing on the menu.
 <br>
 You look really nice tonight.
 <br>
 So do you.
 <br>
 Look, Donna Hello! Can I start you folks off with drinks? Sure I&#39;ll have a beer.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like an iced tea.
 <br>
 - He didn&#39;t even proof me.
 <br>
 - It must be the jacket.
 <br>
 - Or my sideburns.
 <br>
 - What sideburns? These sideburns, right.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t know why they call it fondue.
 <br>
 They should call it fundue.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause it is fun.
 <br>
 I love fondue.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gourmet.
 <br>
 - So, what do we do here, Kitty? - Okay, now.
 <br>
 What you do is you put a piece of steak on your fondue fork.
 <br>
 - Now, how hot exactly is the - No, Bob.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a fondon&#39;t.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t put your hand in the hot oil.
 <br>
 Who knew you couldn&#39;t put your hand in the hot oil? Here, chicken, chicken.
 <br>
 Donna, please.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 - Are you okay? - I am great.
 <br>
 I think you&#39;re drunk.
 <br>
 I think I am, too.
 <br>
 How could I be drunk? There&#39;s about five shots of alcohol in a Long Island Iced Tea.
 <br>
 - Long Island Iced Tea? - Yeah, you guys ordered drinks.
 <br>
 - I&#39;m ready for another one.
 <br>
 - Nope, she&#39;s good.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 I love your little butt, Eric.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so little.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re so good, Eric.
 <br>
 You&#39;re so darn good.
 <br>
 - I think it&#39;s coffee time.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re so good, it makes me hot.
 <br>
 Or time for another Iced Tea maybe.
 <br>
 Sing to me, Eric.
 <br>
 No, I don&#39;t think Sing me a song.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t really Do it or I&#39;ll scream! Move it in, move it out Shove it in, shove it out Disco lady Move it in, move it out Shove it in, all about Well, Jackie.
 <br>
 It&#39;s now 9:00.
 <br>
 Which means that every shoe store in the greater Oshkosh area is closed for the night.
 <br>
 So, what do you want to do now? Let&#39;s go look at the new Corvettes.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean No, that just sounds boring.
 <br>
 What do you wanna do? No, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 You know what we could do? We could Prove our love to each other again.
 <br>
 No, Michael.
 <br>
 We are not going to Prove our love, every single time we have a chance.
 <br>
 Why not? Because it doesn&#39;t work like that.
 <br>
 And just because we did it once does not mean we&#39;re ever gonna do it again.
 <br>
 Okay, now you&#39;re just talking crazy! No, Michael.
 <br>
 No, I am not.
 <br>
 If you think that&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna work, then you&#39;re wrong.
 <br>
 Damn, Jackie.
 <br>
 So I spent all night looking for your stupid shoes - and we&#39;re not even gonna - No.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Are you sure you&#39;re okay with that? Yeah.
 <br>
 Okay, let&#39;s do it.
 <br>
 - Crap.
 <br>
 - Ouch! - Damn! - Ow! Geez! My eye! God.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so crowded in here.
 <br>
 Eric, meet me under the table.
 <br>
 Donna, no.
 <br>
 Look, no.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, come on.
 <br>
 Waiter? Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go get you some coffee.
 <br>
 So, no going under the table, and no singing.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll be right back.
 <br>
 People, the chicken here is excellent.
 <br>
 Hyde&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Hi, Hyde.
 <br>
 Hey, Donna.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s Forman? Coffee.
 <br>
 Okay, look.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just going to say this, all right? Donna, I have feelings for you.
 <br>
 And I think that you have feelings for me.
 <br>
 And Forman&#39;s gonna give you his ring.
 <br>
 And I hope that before you take it, you think about Beep! Eric.
 <br>
 Hyde&#39;s here.
 <br>
 We&#39;re on a date here.
 <br>
 Yeah, man.
 <br>
 You shouldn&#39;t be because we were supposed to be at the library.
 <br>
 Hyde, if she wanted to be at the library, she&#39;d be at the library.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 What do you mean by &#34;Oh, my God&#34;? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Look, when my date&#39;s done puking you better not be here.
 <br>
 Excuse me.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Could I get this in a doggie bag, please? Thanks.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m in a hurry.
 <br>
 Now I feel so close to you, Michael.
 <br>
 Michael and Jackie.
 <br>
 Jackie and Michael.
 <br>
 Doesn&#39;t that sound good? Michael and Jackie.
 <br>
 True love, always, forever.
 <br>
 - Forever? - Forever.
 <br>
 Dances, long walks candles, flowers.
 <br>
 Babies, house.
 <br>
 Shackle, chain despair, prison, death.
 <br>
 &#34;Jonathan Seagull discovered &#34;that boredom, fear, and anger &#34;are the reasons a gull&#39;s life is so short.
 <br>
 &#34;And with this gone from his thought &#34;he lived a long, fine life indeed.
 <br>
 &#34; Bravo! Isn&#39;t she a hot tomato? To the lovemaking.
 <br>
 We had a wonderful time.
 <br>
 My God! Okay, they&#39;re gone.
 <br>
 They used to be normal.
 <br>
 - What the hell happened to them? - I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 How can she not eat meat? That can&#39;t be healthy.
 <br>
 Remember when we used to go on vacation together? Bob and I used to go fishing and drink beers.
 <br>
 - I mean, we used to have fun with them.
 <br>
 - Now they&#39;re into every fad there is.
 <br>
 - Things change, Kitty.
 <br>
 - We don&#39;t.
 <br>
 We don&#39;t have to.
 <br>
 We&#39;re classic.
 <br>
 You know Midge wasn&#39;t wearing a bra tonight.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Bob wasn&#39;t wearing underwear.
 <br>
 Thanks for holding my hair when I was Just thanks for missing my shoes.
 <br>
 - I guess I blew our big night.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 Look, it&#39;s cool.
 <br>
 I thought I was gonna blow it and then, I mean, you totally blew it.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 You know, by telling me I blew it, you basically just blew it.
 <br>
 So And I was doing so good here with the jacket and the coffee and holding your hair back.
 <br>
 I was so in.
 <br>
 You&#39;re still in.
 <br>
 Look, Donna, I want to be your boyfriend.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re all I ever think about.
 <br>
 Will you wear my class ring? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Yes? You know, why don&#39;t we kiss on it later? Right.
 <br>
 The vomit.
 <br>
 No, wait.
 <br>
 You know what? I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 You&#39;re my girlfriend.
 <br>
 So, Forman, man I&#39;m sorry about tonight with Donna.
 <br>
 And for taking your dinner.
 <br>
 So, are we cool, man? Yeah, man.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve gotta be.
 <br>
 Look, we&#39;ve been friends since kindergarten.
 <br>
 No girl&#39;s gonna come between us.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great, man.
 <br>
 So if Donna ever breaks up with you and starts dating me, are we still friends? No.
 <br>
 Tonight, I learned there&#39;s a price to be paid for doing it.
 <br>
 She said, &#34;forever,&#34; man.
 <br>
 And I think she meant it.
 <br>
 The inside of my mouth feels like cotton.
 <br>
 As if cotton was in my mouth.
 <br>
 Kelso, man, women are like muffins, okay? And once you&#39;ve had a muffin, man you will put up with anything to have another muffin.
 <br>
 And they know that.
 <br>
 Now she really owns you, man.
 <br>
 Hyde, you sure know a lot about women.
 <br>
 But, I mean, you&#39;ve never really had a steady girlfriend.
 <br>
 So, what&#39;s that all about? I&#39;ll tell you what that&#39;s all about, Forman.
 <br>
 My mind is pure, man.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t fall victim to the female race.
 <br>
 I&#39;m here, sans girlfriend, to help you guys out.
 <br>
 Then I have a question, Hyde.
 <br>
 How much masturbation is too much? No such thing as too much, Fez.
 <br>
 How&#39;d it go? It was great.
 <br>
 Mom.
 <br>
 Gotcha.
 <br>
 Anybody mention how nice that sport coat was? Donna.
 <br>
 There you go.
 <br>
 So, you had fun? Yeah, Dad.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 You know, you got a chunk of carrot on your shoe there? Yeah, Dad.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
