<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 All right, here&#39;s your motel.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna love Chicago.
 <br>
 You never lived near the ocean, but that&#39;s all about to change thanks to good old Lake Michigan.
 <br>
 Yeah, I just wish I knew someone here.
 <br>
 A friendly face, you know ? Don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna be great.
 <br>
 oh, boy, I got a long drive back.
 <br>
 You know, that door&#39;s kind of tricky.
 <br>
 You gotta actually open it.
 <br>
 All right, Jackie, do you want me to stay and get a burger with you or something ? Oh ! Michael, it&#39;s like you&#39;re a mind reader.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Now keep going.
 <br>
 Guess what I want on my burger.
 <br>
 Lettuce, tomato and ketchup put on by a waiter born in America.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re gonna love teaching in africa.
 <br>
 I hear the women walk around with their hoo-hoos hanging out.
 <br>
 Dad ! You get your shots yet ? Wait.
 <br>
 What shots ? The vaccines to protect you against exotic diseases.
 <br>
 I had to get &#39;em when I was in the military.
 <br>
 You  were in the national guard.
 <br>
 What exotic diseases were you afraid you&#39;d catch scaredy-cat-eatin&#39;- pie in-a-jacuzzi fever ? Hey, I&#39;m proud of my service.
 <br>
 Somebody had to stay home and hose down those hippies.
 <br>
 You guys, I leave for Africa in two days.
 <br>
 How come no one told me about these shots ? Oh, goodness gracious.
 <br>
 Did I forget to give you that letter ? You know, when you get to be my age, sometimes you forget about things.
 <br>
 And sometimes you hide them in the rarely used Mexican soup section of this gigantic cookbook.
 <br>
 Mom, I need these shots.
 <br>
 Africa is very strict about these things, and they&#39;re not strict about anything.
 <br>
 I mean, the women walk around with their hoo-hoos hanging out.
 <br>
 Kitty, you have no right to stand in the way of someone&#39;s dreams.
 <br>
 And if you don&#39;t let Eric go to Africa, you&#39;ll crush my dream of getting rid of him.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;ll give you the shots.
 <br>
 A mother should support her son.
 <br>
 Just know the needles are big as sausages, and if I miss the mark by even a hair, your heart might explode.
 <br>
 But don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 It only hurts till you die.
 <br>
 Donna, look, there&#39;s something really important I need you to do for me.
 <br>
 Eric, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re going to africa.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not doing that.
 <br>
 Please don&#39;t let my mom plan this fancy send-off for me, okay ? I can just see her planning this embarrassing farewell with, like, music and banners and, like, doves.
 <br>
 Oh, man, it&#39;s good to be home.
 <br>
 Jackie was all depressed and crying &#39;cause she didn&#39;t have any friends in chicago, so I had to lighten the mood with some skee-ball.
 <br>
 Um, jackie hates skee-ball.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t take jackie.
 <br>
 Well, that explains why she&#39;s called me four times since she&#39;s been in chicago.
 <br>
 Three of those were to say that she hates my outfit.
 <br>
 How does she know ? Eric ? Jackie&#39;s on the phone.
 <br>
 She wants to talk to you.
 <br>
 Jackie wants to talk to forman ? Yes.
 <br>
 Now pick up, because she&#39;s been blabbering for 20 minutes.
 <br>
 And I never noticed it when she was living here, but she&#39;s not that interesting.
 <br>
 Hello ? Hey, eric ? It&#39;s jackie.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Look, I just realized you&#39;re about to leave for africa, and I won&#39;t get a chance to say good-bye in person.
 <br>
 That makes me sad.
 <br>
 I mean, you&#39;ve always been very special to me.
 <br>
 Okay, jackie, if there&#39;s a gun to your head, say the word cream cheese.
 <br>
 No, eric, I&#39;m just gonna miss you is all, okay ? So just take care of yourself in africa.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I will.
 <br>
 Wait, you want to talk to who ? You want to tell him you love him ? Well, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 You guys didn&#39;t really leave on the best of terms.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Dad, telephone ! I don&#39;t know eric very well, but he seems like a heck of a nice guy.
 <br>
 Eric ? Eric is good people.
 <br>
 Is good people, yes.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll never forget.
 <br>
 It was the hottest day of summer, and hyde and kelso dug a hole then covered it with leaves.
 <br>
 And they said, &#34;hey, fez, &#34;want to see a pile of dead leaves ?&#34; So naturally, I ran over.
 <br>
 What happened ? I fell in, and I couldn&#39;t get out.
 <br>
 And the sun was beating down.
 <br>
 So hot.
 <br>
 So hot.
 <br>
 Finally, eric came over.
 <br>
 And you know what that magnificent boy did ? He poured soda all over me, because that&#39;s what friends do.
 <br>
 And then the ants came.
 <br>
 Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Oh, eric.
 <br>
 about you leaving, uh, I just want you to know that, uh oh, here comes the waterworks ! - Hey, hyde, man.
 <br>
 - Hey, man.
 <br>
 Listen, I want some tunes, so I need to find a record store.
 <br>
 Leo, you&#39;re in a record store.
 <br>
 Whoa, that was fast, man ! So what are you doing here ? I&#39;m the boss, man, which is ironic, &#39;cause I&#39;m also the least-motivated employee.
 <br>
 So if you have a whole record store, how come you&#39;ve been kind of mopey lately, man ? I&#39;m not mopey.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Well, where&#39;s that loud girl you&#39;re always hangin&#39; with ? Jackie ? She&#39;s in chicago.
 <br>
 Loud girl&#39;s in chicago ! Hey, that&#39;s why you&#39;re sad, man.
 <br>
 You love loud girl.
 <br>
 Maybe I do.
 <br>
 You know what ? The only reason I&#39;m admitting that is because you have no short-term memory.
 <br>
 You&#39;re gonna forget this conversation when it&#39;s over.
 <br>
 Hey, that&#39;s not true, man.
 <br>
 Hey, guess what I found out.
 <br>
 What, leo ? Loud girl&#39;s in chicago.
 <br>
 Oh, crap.
 <br>
 It&#39;s almost time for me to go get my shots.
 <br>
 Yeah, why do I have to get shots anyway ? So I get yellow fever.
 <br>
 I could use a little color.
 <br>
 You guys, this might be our last circle together.
 <br>
 We&#39;re growing up.
 <br>
 I mean, these two have jobs, and eric is off to start his life, and I&#39;m doing more shaving than ever.
 <br>
 Eric, I know you&#39;re scared of getting your shots.
 <br>
 So I&#39;m gonna be a pal and get &#39;em with you, &#39;cause I owe you for that time that I chucked that dead raccoon at you, and then it turned out to not be dead.
 <br>
 And then it bit you, and you kicked it back at me, and then it bit me, and then we both had to go and get rabies shots.
 <br>
 Remember on the way to the hospital, kelso saw that dog, and he jumped out of the car&#39; cause he wanted to go pet it, but he forgot the car was moving, and he broke his arm ? That was the funniest, bloodiest, most rabies-filled day ever.
 <br>
 Look at us.
 <br>
 Best friends offering to help each other.
 <br>
 You know, we always have to remember this moment.
 <br>
 What ? Upstairs ! Now ! I am in huge trouble.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe that is what you idiots have been doing in my basement all these years ! I wish I had 2,000 feet so I could put 500 of them in each of your asses ! I&#39;m shocked.
 <br>
 The basement door closes and out come the lighters and the drugs.
 <br>
 And I am sure donna&#39;s down there bouncing around without a bra.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like amsterdam down there.
 <br>
 Did someone shove a vacuum up your nose and suck out your last lonely brain cell ? What is going on in your head ? I am so disappointed in you boys.
 <br>
 And here I thought it was my dryer that made our clothes smell funny.
 <br>
 who taught you how to do this ? Was it those damn beatles ? &#34;All you need is love.
 <br>
 &#34; All you need is a job and a haircut ! And you wipe that stupid smirk off your dopey, dope-fiend face ! Do you know what drugs do to you ? They shrink your brain until one day you wake up, and you think you&#39;re superman and you can fly, and then you wind up jumping off the roof in your underpants.
 <br>
 Oh, this idiot doesn&#39;t need drugs for that.
 <br>
 He does that every saturday.
 <br>
 Well, this is the worst thing that you have ever done ! Eric, I am gonna make you I am going to well, I can&#39;t think of anything worse than sending you to africa.
 <br>
 You&#39;re going to africa ! Hey, leo.
 <br>
 So I decided that tomorrow after I say good-bye to forman, I&#39;m gonna go to chicago.
 <br>
 Hey, loud girl&#39;s in chicago.
 <br>
 You should look her up.
 <br>
 Good idea.
 <br>
 Anyway, what I was thinking is, while I&#39;m gone, you could run the record store.
 <br>
 It&#39;d be fun, man, like the old days at the fotohut.
 <br>
 You know, the film place you used to own ? Wait.
 <br>
 Was it a little blue house in the middle of a parking with a drive-up window ? Exactly.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t remember that at all, man.
 <br>
 Okay, michael, eric, pull your pants down and lean over the table.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll go get those gigantic needles.
 <br>
 I just hope somebody remembered to bring them in out of the rain so they&#39;re not all rusty.
 <br>
 Hey, donna, I&#39;m gonna need you to help me pull my pants off.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Turn around.
 <br>
 Wedgie ! Oh, I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Did you say off ? I thought you said up your butt.
 <br>
 I still liked it.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re leaving tomorrow.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 And it&#39;s kind of weird spending our last moments together bent over a table with our naked butts in the air.
 <br>
 This is how I always hoped it&#39;d be.
 <br>
 You know, I was gonna say that I&#39;ll miss you, but I&#39;m not a nancy-boy.
 <br>
 And, kelso, there&#39;s something I want to say to you son of a bitch ! Oh, that hurt like hell ! That was the alcohol swab.
 <br>
 Well, it was freezing.
 <br>
 Well, this is it.
 <br>
 Just have to make it past mom&#39;s farewell ambush, and then off to africa.
 <br>
 Actually, eric, I wanted to talk to you first.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know if you know this, but I&#39;ve been looking forward to you getting out of the house for a long time.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I believe your exact words were, &#34;it will be more glorious than d-day.
 <br>
 &#34; Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, you&#39;re my son, and I&#39;m your father, so here.
 <br>
 That&#39;s your pocket knife from korea.
 <br>
 You said if I ever touched that, I&#39;d meet the same fate as hundreds of other godless commies.
 <br>
 Well, I want you to take it to africa with you.
 <br>
 Really ? Wow, dad, that means a lot.
 <br>
 And, son, I want you to know that I&#39;m gonna miss you, and I love you, and have a good trip.
 <br>
 Wait a second.
 <br>
 What did you just say ? I said have a good trip.
 <br>
 No, before that.
 <br>
 You heard me.
 <br>
 Wow, this feels like one of those moments when, you know, normal people would hug.
 <br>
 Thank you, dad.
 <br>
 So really, any last-minute advice ? Uh, yeah.
 <br>
 You lose that knife, don&#39;t come home.
 <br>
 surprise.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just you ? Donna, this is the best surprise ever.
 <br>
 So vista cruiser, huh ? This is where we had our first kiss.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I remember.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s gotta last a really long time.
 <br>
 This is weird.
 <br>
 I mean, me leaving.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like it&#39;s real.
 <br>
 Yeah, but you&#39;re gonna be back before you know it, and then we&#39;re gonna have our whole lives to spend together.
 <br>
 Listen to me, donna.
 <br>
 I love you so much.
 <br>
 You know, you&#39;re my best friend.
 <br>
 And I I love you.
 <br>
 And thank you for not letting my mom plan this, like, going-away surprise thing.
 <br>
 I love you, too, eric.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 For what ? For this okay, guys ! Oh - Surprise ! - Surprise ! Mom ! Oh, you know, who am I kidding ? I wanted this.
 <br>
 Oh, eric ! Okay, charlie, I&#39;m gonna put you in charge of this.
 <br>
 If you ever wantto cheer fez up, here&#39;s a little trick.
 <br>
 I got you ! Who got you ? - You do, eric.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Here you go, forman.
 <br>
 A little going-away gift.
 <br>
 Oh, thanks, man.
 <br>
 Hyde, this bag is empty.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I heard about the stuff they have over in africa.
 <br>
 Fill that bad boy up, send it back to me.
 <br>
 Honey, I&#39;m sorry if I smothered you.
 <br>
 That&#39;s just what a mother does.
 <br>
 But I&#39;ve accepted that you&#39;re leaving, and I&#39;m ready to let you go.
 <br>
 Oh, mom.
 <br>
 Mom, you I&#39;m really only allowed one carry-on, so dad ? Come on, kitty.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Eric, I&#39;m not real good with words, so I thought I&#39;d say good-bye the only way I know how.
 <br>
 Hit it, boys.
 <br>
 so long, point place ! oh, for pete&#39;s sake.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 so long, point place ! come in.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Steven ! What, um, what are you doing here ? Uh, nothing.
 <br>
 Had some free time, thought I&#39;d check out chicago.
 <br>
 How&#39;s it goin&#39; ? Um, good.
 <br>
 Hey, do you want to go take a walk, maybe get something to eat ? Jackie, I checked.
 <br>
 No one can see us doing it from the parking lot ! You&#39;re dead.
 <br>
 I&#39;m nude !
 <br>
