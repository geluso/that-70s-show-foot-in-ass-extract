<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Well, here are my boys! How was work? Oh, you know,just another day of restocking upper Point Place with durable household goods.
 <br>
 Sleep soundly, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 I got some big news from the Price Mart home office.
 <br>
 Ooh! They finally gonna let you physically discipline the workers? - No, but I still have a free hand at home.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 Headquarters is having every manager make a departmental training film.
 <br>
 And they picked me for the stockroom.
 <br>
 - Stockroom.
 <br>
 Wow! - Yeah! Steve from Oshkosh got ice and snow management.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Loser.
 <br>
 Well, Red, that is wonderful.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know.
 <br>
 Every single Price Mart stock boy will be trained in the Red Forman way.
 <br>
 Oh, you mean, undermining their self-esteem until they&#39;re too weak to fight back? If you would just zip it for a second you might be interested in hearing who I want to play the stock boy.
 <br>
 Oh, look, Dad, I appreciate the thought- I&#39;m gonna use this idiot! - All right! - ( Hyde Cackling ) Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Man, I guess my movie career is getting started sooner than I thought! Kelso&#39;s playing the stock boy? This is my favorite thing ever.
 <br>
 Well, Michael does have marvelous bone structure.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Oh, but you will too, honey, once you fill out.
 <br>
 Oh, man! Mom burn! Yep.
 <br>
 That&#39;s twice the normal burn.
 <br>
 Dad, how can you choose Kelso to play the Price Mart stock boy? You have a better suggestion? Hello! I am a Price Mart stock boy.
 <br>
 I just came from stocking.
 <br>
 At Price Mart.
 <br>
 And I am currently wearing a Price Mart stock boy smock.
 <br>
 Good point, Eric.
 <br>
 Give your smock to Kelso.
 <br>
 Oh, I don&#39;t think my broad, photogenic shoulders are gonna fit in that little thing.
 <br>
 Now, don&#39;t take this personal, Son.
 <br>
 You&#39;re just too twitchy and skinny.
 <br>
 Well, you know, the camera adds 1 0 pounds.
 <br>
 Yeah, 1 0.
 <br>
 Not 40.
 <br>
 How could he pick Kelso to play the stock boy? I&#39;m the one with the acting experience.
 <br>
 Remember? I was Mushroom Number Two in Alice in Wonderland.
 <br>
 But you were Mushroom Number One in my heart.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Oh, hey.
 <br>
 What&#39;s up? - We&#39;re going to lunch.
 <br>
 - We&#39;re going to lunch? Well, actually, honey, we&#39;re going to lunch.
 <br>
 You and I are going to lunch? Well, no.
 <br>
 You and Donna and I are going to lunch? Well, almost, honey.
 <br>
 - You and Donna are going to lunch? - ( Clicks Tongue ) Nothing gets past you, Einstein.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t think I like the idea of you two going out to lunch together.
 <br>
 Well, what if we bring you back a sandwich? Well, a sandwich isn&#39;t gonna make me feel better, Mom.
 <br>
 Okay, then.
 <br>
 We&#39;re leaving.
 <br>
 Well, in that case, I would like a sandwich.
 <br>
 Yeah, I don&#39;t like this day.
 <br>
 Hey, dudes.
 <br>
 Hey, Leo, man, Huggy Bear called.
 <br>
 He wants his suit back.
 <br>
 Huggy Bear? This is my suit, man.
 <br>
 So, to what do we owe the fancy pants? Great news, man! I inherited a million bucks from my dead uncle! - Shut up.
 <br>
 - No way.
 <br>
 It&#39;s true! So, come on! Let&#39;s share the wealth! Come on.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll buy you anything you want.
 <br>
 Does that include burgers and nudie mags? Include? That&#39;s half the budget, man.
 <br>
 Eric, have you seen Donna? She was supposed to help me sort out my daytime cosmetics from my nighttime cosmetics but she never showed up.
 <br>
 Oh, you haven&#39;t heard? Donna&#39;s got a new friend and I, for one, think it&#39;s time you met her.
 <br>
 Donna! What are you doing? We invented a new cookie.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a variation of the snickerdoodle.
 <br>
 We&#39;re calling it the &#39;&#39;DonnaKitty.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Or the &#39;&#39;Ditty.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; ( Laughs ) We haven&#39;t decided.
 <br>
 Donna, you&#39;re supposed to be sorting- as in, my cosmetics.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I&#39;m real sorry I missed that.
 <br>
 It started as an annoying, but innocent lunch.
 <br>
 And now they&#39;re inventing cookies.
 <br>
 It&#39;s growing, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s the freakin&#39; Blob.
 <br>
 Donna, why do you need a new friend? Haven&#39;t I always been there for you? Uh, no.
 <br>
 I hope your cookies burn! Eric, old people and young people are not supposed to spend time together.
 <br>
 It&#39;s unnatural.
 <br>
 What am I supposed to do about it? Well, you better do something.
 <br>
 You know what girls talk about when they get together.
 <br>
 Um, sugar and spice and everything nice? That&#39;s what we&#39;re made of, you dumb-ass.
 <br>
 They talk about men, and that would be you.
 <br>
 Well, barely.
 <br>
 You know, you could really use a refill on the &#39;&#39;everything nice.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; You know, I wasn&#39;t that worried about Donna and my mom talking about me but now that I&#39;m all paranoid I&#39;m all, like paranoid.
 <br>
 I mean, when did it become okay for them to be friends? Right after your father replaced you with a semi-literate pretty boy.
 <br>
 That&#39;s me.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;ve been thinking about great actors to model myself after and I choose Travolta.
 <br>
 Kelso I can think of no better way to impress Red than by acting like Travolta in his industrial film.
 <br>
 Bravo, man.
 <br>
 That is good advice.
 <br>
 Man, I don&#39;t want Donna and my mom talking about me.
 <br>
 Yeah, and Donna&#39;s a big mouth.
 <br>
 Like, she told me how you wore makeup to last year&#39;s class picture.
 <br>
 What? I did not! I did not.
 <br>
 I had a zit.
 <br>
 Stop looking at me.
 <br>
 Forman, you and I are both victims of parental abandonment.
 <br>
 Luckily, I have a rich hippie benefactor.
 <br>
 He bought me nudie mags I&#39;d never even heard of.
 <br>
 ( Imitating John Travolta ) Yeah, I&#39;ll stock this shelf!.
 <br>
 But someday I&#39;m gonna dance across this whole city.
 <br>
 That&#39;s dead-on.
 <br>
 Okay, we need to talk.
 <br>
 It&#39;s about, shall we say, your new crowd.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t even pretend you and Donna aren&#39;t talking about me.
 <br>
 I know what&#39;s going on here, and it goes a little something like this- ( Eric&#39;s Voice ) Oh, honey, you look wonderful.
 <br>
 ( Eric&#39;s Voice ) Say, can we look at Eric&#39;s naked baby pictures again? They&#39;re right here! My, you could tell even then he&#39;d always be small.
 <br>
 Yeah, he really is tiny.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not satisfying.
 <br>
 Well, how could it be, dear? But at least he&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 Yeah, he&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 For a nancy boy! ( Laughing ) So, what do you say to that? ( Laughing ) ( Laughing Continues ) All right, Kelso.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll just go through a few typical stock boy tasks while I firmly, but kindly, oversee you.
 <br>
 - Got it.
 <br>
 - All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s get started.
 <br>
 Kelso what the hell are you doing? Oh, see, I&#39;m going for a Travolta thing.
 <br>
 Okay, my character&#39;s actually a dancer who&#39;s just stocking shelves until he makes it big.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Let me paint a picture for you.
 <br>
 Just close your eyes.
 <br>
 Okay, imagine with your eyes open.
 <br>
 Just come with me.
 <br>
 ( Women Singing Disco ) ( Ends ) Just stack the cans, moron.
 <br>
 But why am I stacking cans? See, I&#39;m thinking that the manager is a bad guy.
 <br>
 So, why would I stack cans for him? Because if you don&#39;t stack the cans the manager is going to kill you.
 <br>
 Oh! So I&#39;m afraid for my life! That works.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s act! Oh, no.
 <br>
 You&#39;re all alone.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your little buddy, Skipper? Okay, sweetie.
 <br>
 My friendship with Donna is making you uncomfortable, so I&#39;m gonna call it off.
 <br>
 - Really? - Mmm-hmm.
 <br>
 Well, thank you.
 <br>
 Maybe some of your loyalty will rub off on Dad.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t let that bother you.
 <br>
 Michael may have movie-star good looks but you are much, much smarter than he is.
 <br>
 Okay, why couldn&#39;t you have said that in front of everyone instead of how great Kelso&#39;s bone structure is? I don&#39;t want to make anybody feel bad.
 <br>
 Well, good job.
 <br>
 All right, guys.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s shop! Thanks again, Leo.
 <br>
 Yes, thank you.
 <br>
 You know what would make this outfit perfect? A cockatoo.
 <br>
 Then we&#39;ll get a cockatoo.
 <br>
 Or three! Hey, Red, listen, I&#39;ve got this great new idea I want to lay on you about our movie.
 <br>
 Dad, I&#39;ve heard this idea and speaking as an unbiased observer with no score to settle it is great.
 <br>
 Go! Kelso, you don&#39;t get to have ideas.
 <br>
 Dad, if I could just interject.
 <br>
 This idea will literally change industrial filmdom forever.
 <br>
 Go get &#39;em, Kelso! Go! Okay.
 <br>
 The stock boy has a love interest.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Now, before you say no, I&#39;ve already found the perfect person.
 <br>
 Oh, stock boy, I love you! No.
 <br>
 Get out.
 <br>
 Okay, um, Eric&#39;s uncomfortable because he thinks we talk about him- which we don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Although that story about him wearing makeup to his class pictures was a hoot.
 <br>
 But I guess what I&#39;m saying is, um we probably shouldn&#39;t see each other anymore.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s been so nice having someone to talk to since my mom left.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Someone who understands what I&#39;m going through.
 <br>
 Oh, honey.
 <br>
 Someone to make banana bread with.
 <br>
 I ate that for dinner three nights in a row.
 <br>
 Oh, you poor, sweet girl.
 <br>
 What the hell? ( Squawk ) Boy, being a millionaire is great.
 <br>
 Well, at least you put the money to good use.
 <br>
 Fun Tart? Don&#39;t mind if I do.
 <br>
 Candy button? I&#39;ve got a million of them.
 <br>
 So, Leo, man, tell us about your Uncle Ed.
 <br>
 Why&#39;d he leave you all his money? Check it out, man.
 <br>
 It&#39;s all in this letter he sent me.
 <br>
 Your Uncle Ed is Ed McMahon? ( Chuckles ) Yeah.
 <br>
 Who knew I was Scottish? Uh-oh.
 <br>
 Damn, Leo, you didn&#39;t inherit a million dollars.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a sweepstakes contest.
 <br>
 Well, then who has my money? There is no money, you son of a bitch! Oh.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I guess all this stuff has to go back.
 <br>
 Oh, that means you too, Feathery Frank.
 <br>
 - Good day.
 <br>
 - But, Fez- I said, good day.
 <br>
 ( Imitating John Travolta ) I&#39;m leaving Brooklyn, Mister Formanelli.
 <br>
 And when I get to Manhattan, I&#39;m gonna be a star.
 <br>
 So, what do you think? You&#39;re fired.
 <br>
 You.
 <br>
 ( Man Narrating ) Price Mart is only as strong as its weakest stock boy.
 <br>
 Just look at what one well-trained worker can accomplish.
 <br>
 Neat, efficient, organized.
 <br>
 The Price Mart way.
 <br>
 And each job completed with that award-winning Price Mart attitude.
 <br>
 Remember,you can&#39;t spell stock boy without &#39;&#39;Oh, boy.
 <br>
 !&#39;&#39; Perfect.
 <br>
 Well, who would have thought a stock boy would do a good job playing a stock boy? Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s a topsy-turvy world.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 You did a good job.
 <br>
 Wait a minute.
 <br>
 Are you proud of me? No, no, no, no, no.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t say that.
 <br>
 So do we hug now? Men don&#39;t hug.
 <br>
 My daddy loves me! - Shut it! - I love you too, Daddy! Oh, well, look who&#39;s here.
 <br>
 Do a little shopping, ladies? Well, it&#39;s not like I can take my dad shopping.
 <br>
 I mean, every time the sales lady brings over some underwear he gets embarrassed and goes, &#39;&#39;Whoo-hoo!&#39;&#39; So, I suppose you have something snarky to say about that.
 <br>
 You know what? I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 - Really? - No.
 <br>
 Look, your mom can&#39;t take you shopping, so it&#39;s cool with me if you guys want to hang out.
 <br>
 Honey, I am so glad you understand.
 <br>
 - Yeah, Eric, thanks.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah,just, look, please no talking about me, okay? And no looking at my naked baby pictures either.
 <br>
 They&#39;re misleading.
 <br>
 Honey, I&#39;ve already seen you naked.
 <br>
 Mom.
 <br>
 Oh, and she&#39;s already seen you naked! You know what? From now on, that&#39;s all we should talk about.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Leaving now.
 <br>
 Okay, here he is on the potty.
 <br>
 Look how hard he&#39;s concentrating.
 <br>
 Oh, I have some earlier ones.
 <br>
 Look at that baby.
 <br>
 Didn&#39;t he have the cutest little behind? Yeah! So when did he lose it? Right around when he turned 1 0.
 <br>
 It was the strangest thing.
 <br>
 Poof.
 <br>
 Like someone ironed him.
 <br>
 <br>
