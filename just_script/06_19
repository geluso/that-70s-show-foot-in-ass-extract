<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Ooh, yeah.
 <br>
 So yesterday, I&#39;m at this garage sale, I look down, and there it was the Darth Vader action figure with the incredibly rare greenlightsaber.
 <br>
 How have I not kicked your ass yet? - Fore! - Whoa! - Watch out! - Parking lot! oh, it was just a Pinto.
 <br>
 Fez, this is putt-putt.
 <br>
 Your choices are putt or putt.
 <br>
 Hey, what the hell? Oh, Forman.
 <br>
 I should have known it was you guys.
 <br>
 Most people that come here can&#39;t hit the ball that hard on account of they&#39;re in kindergarten.
 <br>
 Mitch, Congratulations.
 <br>
 This seems like the perfect job for someone your size, what with the free lodging and the little castle on hole 6.
 <br>
 Yeah, there&#39;s just enough room in there for me and your mom.
 <br>
 Ooh! Yeah, the sweetest burns involve doing it with your mom.
 <br>
 Look, just quit hitting the ball that hard, or you guys are outta here.
 <br>
 What are you no.
 <br>
 God, I hate that guy.
 <br>
 Tear him a new hole-in-one.
 <br>
 Wow, Forman, I haven&#39;t seen you this pissed since I chased you around your house with that spider in a jar.
 <br>
 You were like, &#34;Hyde, I swear to god!&#34; Then you never did anything.
 <br>
 Yeah? I&#39;m about to do something.
 <br>
 Saison 6 - Episode 19 - No, can&#39;t do that.
 <br>
 Mitch, I&#39;m so sorry.
 <br>
 What? I&#39;ve lost the ability to process language on account of I have a concussion! Here&#39;s more bad news when you return to the course, you&#39;re gonna find that some punk drew boobs and a butt crack on the clown statue.
 <br>
 And don&#39;t try to wash it off &#39;cause I used permanent marker.
 <br>
 Forman, why are we always fighting? I can&#39;t even remember how we got this way.
 <br>
 I think a chick said that to me once.
 <br>
 No, that was me.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you think that we should be friends? Okay, well, you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 you&#39;re obviously having some kind of reaction to your medications.
 <br>
 We&#39;re just gonna go.
 <br>
 Ow! Ow! Ow! You know, Mitch, if you ever want to come hang out in the basement, you know really? Thanks! I&#39;d smile, but the left side of my face is kind of paralyzed.
 <br>
 Forman, why&#39;d you invite him over? You were almost out of there, and you turned back around.
 <br>
 Yeah, Forman, there&#39;s only two times in life that you turn back around basketball and runway modeling.
 <br>
 No, and square dancing.
 <br>
 It&#39;s called a do-si-do.
 <br>
 Look Mitch knows I didn&#39;t mean it.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you got a hold of the Darth Vader with the green lightsaber.
 <br>
 What? No, no, it&#39;s.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 what a geek.
 <br>
 Wow, I love this place.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not just dinner.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a thrill ride, &#39;cause there&#39;s a small chance you&#39;re gettin&#39; knifed.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, Bob.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve tried to avoid Asians with weapons ever since Well it&#39;s thanks to the work of brave men like you that America&#39;s enemies are working here for minimum wage.
 <br>
 Mom, would you please stop playing with his hair? You don&#39;t know where it&#39;s been.
 <br>
 I think a good dinner time policy might be everybody feeds and grooms themselves.
 <br>
 Oh, oh.
 <br>
 And speaking of grooming, Pamela, I noticed that your skirt was torn all the way up to your thigh.
 <br>
 No, I actually bought it this way.
 <br>
 See, most skirts are only slit up to the knee, but I think people want to see more than that.
 <br>
 Hear, hear.
 <br>
 Here comes the waiter.
 <br>
 I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all here to help me celebrate this very special time with this very special lady.
 <br>
 Oh, Bob, it means a lot to me that you realize how special I am.
 <br>
 I do.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I want to ask you to move in with me.
 <br>
 - Oh, my god.
 <br>
 - What? Gosh, Bob, that&#39;s really sweet, and I&#39;d really love to, but I&#39;m seeing someone else.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 But you&#39;ll still come visit, right? what are you doing? I&#39;m not touching you.
 <br>
 Stop it ! But I&#39;m not touching you.
 <br>
 Well, stop not touching me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 wa it better when I wasn&#39;t touching you? Yeah.
 <br>
 They look happy.
 <br>
 Why don&#39;t we have a game? Would you stop asking me &#34;why don&#39;t we have stuff&#34; ? &#34;why don&#39;t we have a song?&#34; &#34;Why don&#39;t we have a movie?&#34; We&#39;re men.
 <br>
 I thought we were sensitive men.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not.
 <br>
 One of us is.
 <br>
 Shut up! And it&#39;s not you.
 <br>
 Well, Mitch, I&#39;ll tell you what.
 <br>
 It&#39;s been really fun having you over, but it&#39;s almost sundown and, uh, we celebrate the sabbath, so unless you have your.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 your, uh your little beanie, then I guess we&#39;re gonna have to say adios or shalom, as we say.
 <br>
 You guys are jewish?! I&#39;m jewish! Oh, wow, you are gorgeous.
 <br>
 Are you kidding me? No, no, no, no, I&#39;m the pretty one.
 <br>
 Me.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the hottest redhead since batgirl.
 <br>
 And you&#39;re not just gorgeous.
 <br>
 I mean, you radiate intelligence deep thought, a real sense of self.
 <br>
 Eric, I like your new friend.
 <br>
 She&#39;s gotta be with you, huh? Oh, I can&#39;t say I haven&#39;t tried, my little friend, but she&#39;s with Eric for now.
 <br>
 Really? Well, what&#39;s wrong with her? Is she, like, an alcoholic or a drug addict? Yeah.
 <br>
 Yeah, she&#39;s addicted.
 <br>
 She needs a daily dose of this guy.
 <br>
 I just think it&#39;s pretty suspicious that after we left the japanese restaurant our japanese carbroke down.
 <br>
 Hey, buddy.
 <br>
 Whoa, Eric, you didn&#39;t tell me you had an older sister.
 <br>
 Oh, please, if you&#39;re gonna go with fake charm, let&#39;s keep it in the realm of reality, okay? Oh, you shut your porky mouth.
 <br>
 I have the skin of a 25-year-old who smokes.
 <br>
 You know, Mr.
 <br>
 Forman, I learned a little about cars from my uncle who used to fix tanks in Vietnam.
 <br>
 Now that&#39;s hero&#39;s work fixing machines that kill people you don&#39;t agree with.
 <br>
 My only regret is that I haven&#39;t had a chance to fight for my country.
 <br>
 Really? Eric&#39;s only regret is that he doesn&#39;t live in space.
 <br>
 That&#39;s not my only regret.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just one of them.
 <br>
 Excellent fruity bebbles.
 <br>
 You know, at the police academy they&#39;ll only give me corn flakes, &#39;cause they say the sugar gets me too hopped upto carry a weapon.
 <br>
 I guess what they weren&#39;t counting on was me taking my weapon home for the weekend.
 <br>
 poor dad.
 <br>
 He&#39;s so upset.
 <br>
 This morning during &#34;the price is right&#34; he didn&#39;t even yodel along during &#34;cliff hanger&#34;.
 <br>
 Donna, we wanted them apart and now they are.
 <br>
 Look, some things just don&#39;t belong together, like my mom and your dad or Michael and a gun.
 <br>
 No, seriously, how could they give me a gun? You don&#39;t even sound like you feel bad.
 <br>
 Donna, this whole thing is your dad&#39;s fault.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, donna.
 <br>
 Who asked the woman to move in with him after knowing her for such a short time? I&#39;ll tell you who The same guy who let you move in here after your parents took off and you had no place else to go my dad.
 <br>
 I mean, you know your mom is wrong and that she hurt my dad who&#39;s never been anything but nice to you.
 <br>
 How can you defend her? I picked the pretty one.
 <br>
 Hey, dad.
 <br>
 How you doin&#39;? How do you think I&#39;m doing? Pam ripped out my heart and stomped on it in shoes I paid for.
 <br>
 Well, do you want to go down to the pet store and look at puppies? You could sing &#34;how much is that doggie in the window?&#34; And I&#39;ll do the &#34;Arf! Arf!&#34; part.
 <br>
 Nah, I&#39;m gonna watch &#34;Love Boat.
 <br>
 &#34; I think the big guy in the shorts is finally gonna nail the girl with the clipboard.
 <br>
 Ha ha ha ha! Yeah! I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the sugar.
 <br>
 Okay, Kelso, truth or dare? Uh truth.
 <br>
 have you ever snuck into my bathroom while I was showering? I mean, dare.
 <br>
 You have snuck in there.
 <br>
 I was there, and I saw you.
 <br>
 I mean, dare.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven, truth or dare? The truth will be whether or not you love me, and the dare will be telling me that you love me.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 pass.
 <br>
 Okay, Mitch, truth or dare? Um, I pick dare, Mitch.
 <br>
 Okay, Mitch, I dare you to kiss Donna.
 <br>
 Mitch.
 <br>
 Naughty Mitch.
 <br>
 Mitch, you goofball, that&#39;s not how it works.
 <br>
 You have to be like, &#34;I dare you to kiss me.
 <br>
 &#34; Okay.
 <br>
 What the hell?! He did it! Look at him go.
 <br>
 He&#39;s like a hummingbird.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe Mitch would do that.
 <br>
 He just flew at you like one of the little monkeys from &#34;The Wizard of Oz.
 <br>
 &#34; I was scared.
 <br>
 Much like you are when you watch &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I don&#39;t want Mitch hanging out here anymore.
 <br>
 He was just fooling around.
 <br>
 He didn&#39;t mean anything by it.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like Fez.
 <br>
 He&#39;s all over me all the time, but it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s after me.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Yes, it does.
 <br>
 From now on, I&#39;ll try to be clearer.
 <br>
 Oh, mom, there you are.
 <br>
 How could you do that to Bob? Now, honey, Bob&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 No, he won&#39;t.
 <br>
 Mom, bob is a wonderful guy with a huge heart who only worries about what he could do for other people.
 <br>
 And, yeah, okay, maybe he has an afro.
 <br>
 But sometimes goodness and afros go together.
 <br>
 But, Jackie, the other guy that I&#39;m seeing is a Lincoln dealer.
 <br>
 Oh, my god, mom, really?! Wow, we could be driving matching pink.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 no, no.
 <br>
 Mom, no.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Okay, look, I know.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I know that Bob might not be the the smoothest or the classiest guy you&#39;ve ever dated, but I&#39;ve learned that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a bad person.
 <br>
 Oh, I knew I shouldn&#39;t have sent you to public school.
 <br>
 Mom, if you keep thinking this way, you&#39;ll always be running from one place to another looking for something better instead of just being happy with what you have.
 <br>
 You know what? I guess you have a lot of thinking to do.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 More tequila, Hirohito.
 <br>
 I said thinking.
 <br>
 Hello? Is anyone here? Hyde? Well, I guess it&#39;s time for me and It was a dark time for the Force.
 <br>
 After the Formanian wars, young Luke Skywalker had to face his most formidable enemy yet.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Darth Vader with a rare and deadlier green lightsaber.
 <br>
 what? No.
 <br>
 Mitch! Mitch, these omelets are amazing.
 <br>
 Well, you know, an omelet&#39;s only as beautiful as the person who eats it.
 <br>
 So, I&#39;d have to say that this omelet has the prettiest red hair I&#39;ve ever seen.
 <br>
 Thief! He&#39;s a thief! You stole my Vader action figure.
 <br>
 Oh, you too ? I thought Eric was the only one weird enough to play with a doll.
 <br>
 Action figure.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s bad enough you stole a kiss from my girlfriend, but this.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 this has gone too far.
 <br>
 Oh, so my honor is less important than a doll? Action figure! Now give it back! Hold on just a second.
 <br>
 Now, Mitch, did you or did you not put onions in my omelet? &#39;Cause I asked for &#39;em, but I didn&#39;t see you put &#39;em in there.
 <br>
 Eric, I didn&#39;t take your action figure.
 <br>
 - Dolls ! - Action Figure ! I wouldn&#39;t do that, especially not to a friend.
 <br>
 What? We&#39;re not friends, man.
 <br>
 We never were.
 <br>
 I only invited you over here &#39;cause I felt bad for you, but I don&#39;t like you.
 <br>
 And guess what.
 <br>
 Neither does anyone else.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I won&#39;t bother you guys anymore.
 <br>
 Somebody needs to flip that in about three minutes! Well, that was brutal.
 <br>
 I feel bad for the little guy.
 <br>
 I just wanna put him up on my shoulders and buy him a balloon.
 <br>
 Eric, how could you? Mitch had a lot of good qualities, like, for example, he worshiped me.
 <br>
 I mean, at one point, I thought he was gonna light a fire and dance around me.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, you know what? I was right, okay? He&#39;s a thief.
 <br>
 Eric, were you playing in the bathtub with your little doll? Action figure! Oh, no.
 <br>
 In the tub, Forman? It is getting really hard to be your friend.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;d like to thank everyone for coming back here with me.
 <br>
 True, it is the place of my greatest humiliation.
 <br>
 But the fish is good, the sake&#39;s strong, and these Japanese people are funny to watch.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the spirit, dad.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 the slightly offensive spirit.
 <br>
 Well, you know, I think you&#39;re lucky to be rid of Pam with her halter tops and her tight skirts.
 <br>
 You know, I&#39;ve never even seen a panty line on her.
 <br>
 You know what that means.
 <br>
 Plus, you&#39;re too nice for my mom anyway.
 <br>
 You know, someday you&#39;re gonna make a slightly less attractive woman very happy.
 <br>
 Hello, Bob.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s not a beautiful dream, it&#39;s really me.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve been doing some thinking, Bob, and I realized that my priorities are a little mixed up.
 <br>
 I told her that! That was me! I saved the day! It doesn&#39;t matter how it happened.
 <br>
 The important thing is she&#39;s back in our lives.
 <br>
 Anyway, Bob, I realize that you&#39;re the man for me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry, Pam.
 <br>
 It&#39;s too late.
 <br>
 I&#39;m completely over you.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 o-v-e-r, over.
 <br>
 And I want to move in with you.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s your key.
 <br>
 Dad? Are you sure this is a good idea? She makes me happy, kitten.
 <br>
 Ugh, fine.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t want to see, like, any of her pantie slaying around the house.
 <br>
 Oh, don&#39;t worry.
 <br>
 You won&#39;T.
 <br>
 Hey, Mitch.
 <br>
 Look, I wanted to apologize.
 <br>
 I thought you stole my Vader, but it turns out I left it in the b.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Hyde stole it.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess I was out of line, too.
 <br>
 I shouldn&#39;t have jumped on your girlfriend in front of you.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, you have such a great life.
 <br>
 And if I never see you or your friends ever again, I&#39;m always gonna treasure that time that I spent with Donna.
 <br>
 Okay, well then I&#39;ll just say good-bye.
 <br>
 so lonely.
 <br>
 Hey, Mitch, uh you know, if you ever want to hang out, you know, you&#39;re always you know.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Oh, are we gonna do this now? Yeah, buddy, let&#39;s do it! Okay.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Hey, so do you think I might have a shot with Donna? Mitch, she&#39;s my fiancée.
 <br>
 So that&#39;s a maybe! Oh, Pamela, hi.
 <br>
 I just, um, came here to get my scarf.
 <br>
 Oh, phew, here it is.
 <br>
 You lost our scarf I must to make you nervous.
 <br>
 We take a drink ? Oh, oh, well, it&#39;s a little early, but.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 oh, it&#39;s probably Two saigon slammers, hold the fruit.
 <br>
 First round&#39;s on me.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 I have a tab.
 <br>
