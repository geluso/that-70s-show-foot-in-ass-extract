 So you gotta work at the radio station on Christmas Eve? God, it&#39;s like doesn&#39;t anyone respect the sanctity of that holy night? We were gonna get drunk and fool around behind your dad&#39;s manger scene.
 <br>
 But this is my first shot at DJ-ing.
 <br>
 If I do well, Hot Donna could be the regular DJ on Tuesdays from 1 to 5 am.
 <br>
 Every insomniac and burn out in town is gonna know who I am.
 <br>
 Well say hello to your target audience.
 <br>
 Play more Zeppelin.
 <br>
 You guys, I&#39;ve got some terrible news.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve just been kicked off the cheerleading squad.
 <br>
 - Oh my little Jesus! - Oh no!    - Why? Jackie I know how you feel, I once got kicked off a cheerleader.
 <br>
 Well I need to get back on that squad.
 <br>
 They might be a bunch of pom-pom waving bitches, but they&#39;re all I know.
 <br>
 Steven, you&#39;ve gotta take me to the &#34;Christmas Eve dance&#34; tomorrow night.
 <br>
 Uh no.
 <br>
 I can either dance with, or spend Christmas Eve with you; cannot do a combo.
 <br>
 Steven, they will never take me back if I don&#39;t show up all proud.
 <br>
 If you could just seethat this is something that&#39;sreally important to me thenyou&#39;d understand that as my boyfriendyou should go.
 <br>
 Fine! Please Fine! Hey shut up, if I&#39;m going, you guys are coming with me.
 <br>
 Oh no, cannot go to a high school dance! I&#39;m gonna be a father soon I gotta start acting more mature.
 <br>
 All right, orange! Yeah, I&#39;m not going either.
 <br>
 The football team and I have a little disagreement.
 <br>
 They think it&#39;s funny to stuff me into a locker, and I disagree! Yeah man, the day I graduated, I promised myself I would never set foot in that God forsaken place again.
 <br>
 Great news, kids.
 <br>
 Red&#39;s gonna be the Santa down at the mall on Christmas Eve, and I&#39;ve signed you all up to be his little helpers.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;m sorry Mom, we&#39;re all going to the Christmas Eve dance at school.
 <br>
 That 70&#39;s show Season 6 Episode 7 Christmas Don&#39;t go away kids, &#34;A Year Without A Santa Claus&#34; will be right back.
 <br>
 Man, Heat Miser is badass.
 <br>
 So what time are you coming down the station tonight? Let&#39;s see, the Christmas dance starts eight o&#39;clock, so I&#39;ll just come as soon as it gets lame say uh 8:02.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Hey y&#39;know what, I&#39;ll even bring you something sweet to munch on, oh and some cookies! What? Oh, What? Okay now, please stand still.
 <br>
 Nobody likes a Santa with plumbers butt.
 <br>
 - Why am I doing this?       - Because I wanna force some good cheer through your clogged arteries and into your cranky heart.
 <br>
 Yeah, it&#39;s like Christmas Draino.
 <br>
 I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re replacing me as Santa, Red.
 <br>
 Three years and now management says I&#39;m too jolly? - What do you want, Bob? - I want to be Santa! Well, it&#39;s Red&#39;s turn this year.
 <br>
 Santa could use an elf.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 But I don&#39;t wanna sit in the back and pretend to assemble toys, I want to participate.
 <br>
 Yeah Bob, you gotta keep your dignity.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re in an elf costume, you don&#39;t want that tiny hammer making you look silly.
 <br>
 Steven, for the Christmas Eve dance What do you think about this tie Maybe this jacketHow about a blazer? Fine! Bolo? - Fine - Ok! Okay Brooke, I made a list of all the reasons why I&#39;m gonna make a great dad for our little baby.
 <br>
 Okay number one, I am a waiter, so we&#39;ll never run out of straws.
 <br>
 See, look kids love straws Michel, look I really appreciate the gesture, but no thanks.
 <br>
 Seriously, I think if we just hang out, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m getting a lot more mature.
 <br>
 I mean, just the other day I watched golf, and took a nap.
 <br>
 Look Michael, if we weren&#39;t in this situation I think you&#39;d be a really good friend.
 <br>
 I mean you&#39;re nice, you bring me stuff,dogs love you.
 <br>
 I just think we should limit our time together  to almost none.
 <br>
 Alright, how about we make a compromise between &#39;almost none&#39; and what I want to do, which is &#39;it&#39;? Okay, if you want, you can help me hang decorations tonight for the library&#39;s Christmas party.
 <br>
 Spend Christmas Eve in a library? Why don&#39;t you just kick me in the &#39;nads? Okay, here comes Julie, the head cheerleader.
 <br>
 Now, Steven make me look good.
 <br>
 - Hello Jackie.
 <br>
 - Hello Julie! This is my boyfriend, Steven J.
 <br>
 Hyde the third.
 <br>
 First two are in jail.
 <br>
 He pretends to be poor, isn&#39;t that funny? I have to say, I thought you&#39;d be too embarrassed to show your face here tonight.
 <br>
 Well to be honest, I only came to see your outfit  so I&#39;d know what not to wear.
 <br>
 Well, let me show you the back.
 <br>
 You&#39;re trying to get back on the cheerleading squad; shouldn&#39;t you be nice to her? Bitchiness is the only language cheerleaders understand.
 <br>
 These are bad girls, they need to be punished, and they know it.
 <br>
 Yeah this is way better than hanging out at the library with Brooke.
 <br>
 Lotta great memories in here.
 <br>
 Did it in there did it back there got caught by Miss Tompkins doing it down there did it with Miss Tompkins over there.
 <br>
 Everyone look for football players, I cannot spend another holiday in a locker.
 <br>
 And this time if I don&#39;t show up for two days, come look for me.
 <br>
 Oh my God, Eric Forman? You look great, I love your shirt.
 <br>
 Really? I wore this shirt for four years, and no one said a thing.
 <br>
 I guess now you really fill it out.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 I&#39;m I&#39;m like up to seventeen push-ups a night so No I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s because you&#39;re not a high school boy anymore.
 <br>
 Yeah, you&#39;re eighteen now.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve seen and done it all.
 <br>
 No, no I yes, yes I have.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s true Hey, you need to watch out okay? Girls are talking to you, I think there might be a practical joke in the works.
 <br>
 No man, I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 I think it&#39;s cause I graduated.
 <br>
 Hyde, am I cool now? Well, you&#39;re cool like margarine is butter.
 <br>
 Close, but there&#39;s a little aftertaste.
 <br>
 You&#39;re in the middle of a Christmas Eve rock block on WFPP with me, Hot Donna.
 <br>
 That was bacon.
 <br>
 I recorded that myself earlier today.
 <br>
 Stay tuned for more Christmas classics with me, Hot Donna.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry but that is just too cool.
 <br>
 Okay, Mr.
 <br>
 Clause.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s hear your best Santa laugh.
 <br>
 You left out a &#39;ho&#39;, Red.
 <br>
 It&#39;s three ho&#39;s, did you even read the Santa manual? Okay Red, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine.
 <br>
 Just remember Santa is a cheerful, jolly fellow, who never calls a child dumbass.
 <br>
 So what do ya want for Christmas? I want a slinky.
 <br>
 A slinky? Oh you&#39;ll get sick of a slinky in a day.
 <br>
 I&#39;m putting you down for flash cards.
 <br>
 Math - that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting for Christmas.
 <br>
 Next! - I want a pony.
 <br>
 - Ponies die.
 <br>
 What you need is a good pair of boots.
 <br>
 Go on keep it moving.
 <br>
 I want a flying car.
 <br>
 I did too when I was your age, kid.
 <br>
 But then the future came and took my dreams away.
 <br>
 Just like it&#39;s gonna take yours.
 <br>
 Okay, okay little girl, y&#39;know what? I bet if you&#39;re extra good, you&#39;ll get your flying car one day.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t listen to her, it&#39;s a lie.
 <br>
 Bad Santa.
 <br>
 Yep, life after graduation sure is sweet.
 <br>
 Some days I wake up and I&#39;m like &#34;hey I&#39;m having ice-cream for breakfast&#34; And you know what, I do.
 <br>
 Wow, so what have you two been up to since graduation? She talked to me, what do I do? Yeah, I got a librarian pregnant.
 <br>
 Damn, good answer.
 <br>
 So, like Eric, what are your plans for the future? Well, I guess I&#39;m just gonna keep on keepin&#39; on, y&#39;know? I&#39;m thinking about buying a boat.
 <br>
 Okay, we&#39;re back and uh, if my boyfriend&#39;s listening you&#39;re late and I&#39;m a little worried you&#39;re trapped in a snow drift or something.
 <br>
 So honey if you&#39;re cold, I&#39;m with ya baby.
 <br>
 Okay so let&#39;s take some requests.
 <br>
 Hello, you&#39;re on the air.
 <br>
 Hi, I&#39;d like to dedicate &#34;He&#39;s the Greatest Dancer&#34; by Sister Sledge, to Eric Forman, the coolest guy at the Christmas dance.
 <br>
 What? He&#39;s still at the dance? Sorry I have to go, he&#39;s telling us about his boat.
 <br>
 That sneaky bastard.
 <br>
 Uh, that sneaky bastard Santa Clause is on his way with a non-stop block of classic Christmas tunes.
 <br>
 And remember you&#39;re listening to WFPP with me, Hot Donna.
 <br>
 You hear that Eric Forman? That&#39;s not bacon, that&#39;s your ass when I get a hold of you.
 <br>
 Hey, I brought you something sweet to munch on - oh and some cookies! Oh man, I knew that was funny.
 <br>
 Man, I can&#39;t stop thinking about Brooke.
 <br>
 I mean, both you and me know that every girl in here wants me except for the couple of weirdo&#39;s that seem to want you but I don&#39;t care about any on them.
 <br>
 Look Kelso, are you sure you don&#39;t just have a crush on Brooke because she&#39;s a librarian, and you&#39;ve seen some librarian layout in Playboy? Eric, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s part of it.
 <br>
 Whatever, I&#39;m going to the library.
 <br>
 Whoa, that felt weird to say.
 <br>
 Steven you don&#39;t look like you&#39;re having a good time.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 I know, but I need you to act like you are.
 <br>
 Just think about stuff you enjoy, like shoplifting or dirty jeans.
 <br>
 Jackie, how come you never to me you were dating an older man? Well I guess I was just distracted by the life I lead outside of cheerleading, where I do fun and glamorous things, with my older, mysterious boyfriend.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Why just last week, we sat on the couch and had a fight.
 <br>
 I&#39;m jealous.
 <br>
 Ah this dance sucks.
 <br>
 None of the girls remember me, they all think I&#39;m a waiter.
 <br>
 Hey, I got an idea how you can get these girls attention.
 <br>
 Oh boy, does it involve me hiding in the girl&#39;s bathroom? - No! - Okay, we&#39;ll try your way.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s what really happened in Vietnam! - I don&#39;t understand! - Neither do I, kid.
 <br>
 Neither do I.
 <br>
 Okay little boy, time to say goodbye to Santa.
 <br>
 What&#39;s an ambush? It&#39;s a pretty bush with yellow flowers.
 <br>
 Kitty I gotta tell ya, I&#39;m good with kids I really taught him something.
 <br>
 Y&#39;know I think I&#39;m beginning to feel the Christmas sprit.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m glad Red, but let&#39;s try telling a Christmas story where nobody gets caught in a fire fight.
 <br>
 Bob what the hell are you doing? You&#39;re depressing the kids, I&#39;m Santa now.
 <br>
 Get out of my chair Bob, or you&#39;re gonna get a candy cane up your chimney.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not moving.
 <br>
 Kitty hold my silly red hat.
 <br>
 You&#39;re right, I really am funny.
 <br>
 What do you think you&#39;re doing? Eric you never showed up, I was worried about you.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m sorry, I guess I lost track of time, maybe it&#39;s because I am a God to these people.
 <br>
 Donna they like this shirt.
 <br>
 This is a horrible shirt.
 <br>
 I gave you that shirt.
 <br>
 I know, I love this shirt.
 <br>
 Eric I can&#39;t believe you let yourself get a swelled head just because a couple of high school kids think you&#39;re cool.
 <br>
 Excuse me, aren&#39;t you Hot Donna? You were so awesome on the radio today.
 <br>
 You really think? Wait, what&#39;s going on? I think we&#39;re in for a treat.
 <br>
 Nice decorations.
 <br>
 I see you&#39;re using one of the better tasting glues.
 <br>
 What are you doing here? Oh I just though instead of having a fun Christmas Eve somewhere else, I&#39;d rather have a boring one here with you.
 <br>
 But we could have some fun.
 <br>
 Michael, I&#39;ve told you before, just because you come to the library after hours, does not mean I&#39;m gonna walk around topless.
 <br>
 But it&#39;s Christmas.
 <br>
 Oh here let me help you with the decorations.
 <br>
 Pregnant women should not be standing on their tip toes, cause the baby will come out all cross eyed.
 <br>
 Listen, if you think you&#39;re gonna get me interested in you by being cute and making me laugh well it&#39;s probably gonna work.
 <br>
 But if you screw this up, I&#39;m gonna ruin your credit with thousands of dollars in library fines.
 <br>
 Fair enough.
 <br>
 Well what say we seal this newfound friendship with a round of topless ornament hanging? Okay fine, whatever you wanna do topless! This mall is only big enough for one Santa, Bob.
 <br>
 Tell ya what, you name 5 reindeer and I&#39;ll step down.
 <br>
 I can name 5 toes that are gonna be in your ass.
 <br>
 Oh for goodness sake, why don&#39;t we stop calling it Christmas and call it Assmas? Fine, I&#39;ll go.
 <br>
 I only got worked up because Joanne&#39;s gone, Donna&#39;s working.
 <br>
 The only people I got at home are my two friends, Egg and Nog.
 <br>
 Alright fine.
 <br>
 You wanna be Santa, go ahead.
 <br>
 - Thanks Red Yeah it&#39;s all for the best, I&#39;ve already eaten about 2 pounds of fake beard as it is.
 <br>
 There he is.
 <br>
 Santa&#39;s the one that told me communists hate God.
 <br>
 Gotta go Santa.
 <br>
 Merry Christmas, Bob.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Clause needs a drink.
 <br>
 And then I push a button, and it sounds like bacon.
 <br>
 This is so awesome; we&#39;re like a celebrity couple.
 <br>
 - It&#39;s intoxicating.
 <br>
 - Donna it is a heady brew.
 <br>
 Hey let&#39;s go drink beer in front of some sophomores.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Jackie, in light of you showing up tonight with your boyfriend, who by the way is totally cool, and a fox.
 <br>
 Big newsflash there.
 <br>
 I&#39;d like to invite you to rejoin the cheer squad.
 <br>
 Really? You know I don&#39;t think I wanna be a cheerleader anymore.
 <br>
 But we hugged and jumped.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m gonna have to take back that hug and jump with a pout and a shrug.
 <br>
 Are you telling me I came to this hell hole for nothing? No, not for nothing, Steven.
 <br>
 I realised these girls aren&#39;t my friends anymore.
 <br>
 I learned something about myself.
 <br>
 Oh, well isn&#39;t that  Okay, well if it makes you feel any better, I get to keep the uniform.
 <br>
 Yeah that helps.
 <br>
 You set me up, &#39;sing a song they&#39;ll all love you&#39;, well I&#39;m gonna spend Christmas in a locker.
 <br>
 Oh crap, I&#39;m still on the air! Hmm.
 <br>
 Jigsaw puzzle.
 <br>
 baseball glove.
 <br>
 Barbie doll tea set.
 <br>
 - Wow, you&#39;re good at this.
 <br>
 - Yeah, I&#39;ve had a little practice.
 <br>
 Ant farm.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a Lone Ranger cap gun set.
 <br>
