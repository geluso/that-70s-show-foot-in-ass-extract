 Hey, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 Hey, Red.
 <br>
 Hello, boys.
 <br>
 You&#39;re up bright and early this morning.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going to Funland! It&#39;s super fun! Oh, Red, remember how we used to take Eric there when he was little? Remember how I used to get on the roller-coaster with him and then,just before we took off, I&#39;d jump out and wave good-bye? Boy, did he scream.
 <br>
 Well, it sounds like fun.
 <br>
 Super fun! And we figured Eric could use some fun, you know, since he and Donna broke up.
 <br>
 - What? - Broke up? Yeah, I heard Donna dumped his ass.
 <br>
 That&#39;s funny.
 <br>
 I heard Eric was the one who dumped Donna.
 <br>
 - Sure, he did.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t think so.
 <br>
 - Yeah, right.
 <br>
 Well, Eric must be just a wreck.
 <br>
 ( Radio:Man Singing Self-pitying Ballad ) - ( Frequencies Tuning ) -  ( Same Song ) - ( Frequencies Tuning ) -  ( Same Song ) Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just listen to A.
 <br>
 M.
 <br>
 ( &#39;50s Rock Ballad ) That&#39;s just cruel.
 <br>
 ( Stops ) ( Resumes ) Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Come on, Forman.
 <br>
 Get out of bed.
 <br>
 Yes, we have to go to Funland before all the fun is gone.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not going.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) - Geez.
 <br>
 - Forman, man, snap out of it.
 <br>
 So you had one of the hottest chicks in Point Place and you blew it.
 <br>
 Could be worse.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) No, it couldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 Eric, it&#39;s not all bad.
 <br>
 Think about Bob being your father-in-law.
 <br>
 That guy&#39;d be in all your wedding pictures.
 <br>
 Guys, I don&#39;t want to talk about Donna and I don&#39;t want to go to Funland.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re not going with us, we&#39;ll stay here with you.
 <br>
 We&#39;re not going to Funland? Don&#39;t touch the G.
 <br>
 I.
 <br>
 Joes.
 <br>
 - Hey, Eric, did you- - Hey, buddy, can we not talk? Thanks.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 We&#39;re going to Funland.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Go.
 <br>
 You know what? I&#39;m glad you are not going to Funland because you will suck the fun right out of it.
 <br>
 And then-And then it would just be called &#39;&#39;Landland.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll get you a candy apple, okay? Okay, okay, I got Eric out of bed.
 <br>
 He&#39;s on his way down.
 <br>
 Now remember, don&#39;t say anything about Donna.
 <br>
 He&#39;ll talk when he&#39;s ready.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Gee, Son, you look like you&#39;ve just been dumped.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t dumped, okay? We broke up.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, run it off.
 <br>
 Do you want to talk about it, honey? No.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Are you sure? Yes.
 <br>
 Yes, I&#39;m sure.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not talk.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) Eric, you are a handsome young man with a lot to offer.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Can I go now? No, no, no.
 <br>
 Not until you eat.
 <br>
 You look like you haven&#39;t eaten for a week.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Kitty.
 <br>
 He always looks like that.
 <br>
 Well, maybe so.
 <br>
 But he won&#39;t have the strength to get over Donna if he doesn&#39;t eat.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Fine! I&#39;ll eat.
 <br>
 Just no more talking about Donna.
 <br>
 For one minute, I&#39;d like to not think about Donna.
 <br>
 No Donna.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) - Red, you should go talk to him.
 <br>
 - What? Why me? Because I don&#39;t really know how to mend a broken heart.
 <br>
 I&#39;ve never been dumped.
 <br>
 Oh, I don&#39;t believe that.
 <br>
 Why not? Well, there are certain things about you that are annoying that other people might not have been as tolerant of.
 <br>
 You&#39;re bald! See? Like that! ( Calliope ) Okay, Michael, we have to stay together.
 <br>
 Every time we come here you get lost.
 <br>
 Damn,Jackie, there&#39;s fun around every corner.
 <br>
 Michael, what are the rules? Uh, no hitting you from behind with the bumper cars.
 <br>
 And? And no riding the goats at the petting zoo.
 <br>
 And? - We have to stay together, Michael! - Fine! - Balloons! - Stay! Hey there, kids! I&#39;m Woofy, the Funland Dog, and I&#39;m here to make sure that you have fun, fun, fun! Touch me like that again you&#39;re gonna eat your Alpo through a straw, straw, straw! Oh.
 <br>
 Okeydokey.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m going down to the saloon to look for the guy who shot my paw.
 <br>
 ( Laughing, Howling ) Oh, my God! That was Woofy, and he talked to us! Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet in case we split up.
 <br>
 How about the corner of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard? I mean, that should be easy enough for even Michael to remember.
 <br>
 Michael? - Great.
 <br>
 Now we&#39;ll never find him.
 <br>
 - Sure we will.
 <br>
 All we have to do is show people his picture, and they&#39;ll help us find him.
 <br>
 You have a picture of Kelso in your wallet? Of course.
 <br>
 I carry pictures of all my friends.
 <br>
 You&#39;re friends with Nipsey Russell? I want to be.
 <br>
 I know he&#39;s in there.
 <br>
 Go talk to him.
 <br>
 - I don&#39;t want to.
 <br>
 - Fine.
 <br>
 But when I broke up with Archie Wilkins, he lived with his parents until he was 40.
 <br>
 Good God, Kitty.
 <br>
 That&#39;s another 23 years! All right.
 <br>
 I&#39;m going in.
 <br>
 Hey, Eric.
 <br>
 How you doin&#39;? Dad, I&#39;m really not in the mood for conversation.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;ll talk and you listen.
 <br>
 I ever tell you the story about Larry &#39;&#39;No Foot&#39;&#39; Mulligan? Well, I can guess.
 <br>
 He had no foot? Larry was a buddy of mine who lost his foot during the war.
 <br>
 And then, on his way back to the States ol&#39; One Foot- at that point we were calling him One Foot- had his ship go down and a shark ate his other foot.
 <br>
 But he made it all the way back home.
 <br>
 And do you know what happened to him when he got here? He overcame his handicap and, ironically, became a shoe salesman? No.
 <br>
 His girlfriend dumped him.
 <br>
 Well, thank God it had a happy ending.
 <br>
 Look, the point of the story is, you&#39;ve got both feet.
 <br>
 You&#39;ll be fine.
 <br>
 Now, put some shoes on, go on down and trim the hedges.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, you know, I think I&#39;m just gonna stay up here.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, you know, I think you&#39;re not.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 Have you seen him? His name is Kelso.
 <br>
 Kelso&#39;s trapped in a box? Hey! Fez, check it out.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Fun University.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Now check out the back.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;F.
 <br>
 U.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; I don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 U.
 <br>
 , man.
 <br>
 F.
 <br>
 U.
 <br>
 ! Oh, right.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Fu.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; That&#39;s a good one.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good one.
 <br>
 I tried to look for Michael, but I can&#39;t see over the crowd.
 <br>
 I wish Donna was here.
 <br>
 She&#39;s a giant.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t remind me.
 <br>
 I asked her and asked her and asked her to come, and she just kept saying &#39;&#39;Get out of my bathroom, Fez!&#39;&#39; Well, we still have to find Michael.
 <br>
 What time is it? Did someone ask what time it is? Why, here in Funland, it&#39;s always &#39;&#39;Fun o&#39;clock!&#39;&#39; ( Barbershop Quartet ) ( Answering In Song ) Yeah, yeah, thanks a lot, you morons.
 <br>
 ( Stops ) Hey, you guys wouldn&#39;t happen to know what time it is, would you? ( Answering In Song ) ( Laughs ) Oh, yeah! - Rock on! -  ( Ends ) I thought we were in love.
 <br>
 Oh, God.
 <br>
 And then it all just blows apart.
 <br>
 And all that&#39;s left is this big hole, you know? Uh, no, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Oh! But there is a gopher hole out back.
 <br>
 And if you shove the hose down and flush him out I&#39;ll stand at the other end and hit him in the head with a shovel.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Just go, Dad.
 <br>
 Thanks.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Well, I see sunshine outside, but I don&#39;t see sunshine inside.
 <br>
 Wanna talk about the breakup, Bambi? No, Dad, I don&#39;t want to talk about it.
 <br>
 You know, we were happy.
 <br>
 But he had to push me.
 <br>
 He had to define everything and get his little ring on me.
 <br>
 By the time it was over, we weren&#39;t even together anymore.
 <br>
 I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Son of a bitch.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Listen, when you&#39;re done- I know, I know.
 <br>
 Put the bags on the curb.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;Hey&#39;&#39;? Is that all you have to say to me? Well, what do you have to say to me? Huh.
 <br>
 How about this? &#39;&#39;Hey.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - I&#39;m not wrong! - You are wrong, you dill-hole! Oh, great.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 That&#39;s really mature.
 <br>
 Double dill-hole! &#39;&#39;Double dill-hole&#39;&#39;? Oh, geez! You were outside.
 <br>
 You were happy.
 <br>
 Why are you back in bed? Well, I guess all that fresh air got me thinking that I&#39;d rather be in bed.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, get up.
 <br>
 It&#39;s time to go to work.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 Oh, and, uh, you don&#39;t have to worry about that gopher.
 <br>
 It&#39;s as dead as you and Donna.
 <br>
 Too soon, huh? I can&#39;t believe you two.
 <br>
 Poor Michael is lost, and all you&#39;ve done is gone on rides and have fun.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! The Funland Princess! The Funland Princess? I haven&#39;t been on that ride yet.
 <br>
 So, I figured this is the lost and found and I lost my friends so they&#39;re bound to show up here sooner or later.
 <br>
 Right? I miss my friends.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;I miss my friends.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - What? - &#39;&#39;What?&#39;&#39; - Stop it.
 <br>
 - &#39;&#39;Stop it.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; - Stop copying me! - &#39;&#39;Stop copying me!&#39;&#39; - I&#39;m stupid.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re stupid.
 <br>
 Damn it! Hey, how about that new cashier at work? Not bad, huh? Single too.
 <br>
 - Dad, I&#39;m not- - What? Is it the braces? Well you know what helps a fella get over a gal? Pimiento loaf.
 <br>
 ( Laughing ) ( Groans ) What happened here, Red? I thought you were gonna help him.
 <br>
 Kitty, I yelled at him all day.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know what else to do.
 <br>
 Well, how did you get through your first breakup? What&#39;s to get over? It happened.
 <br>
 I took it like a man.
 <br>
 She was the best thing that ever happened to me.
 <br>
 Oh, Eloise.
 <br>
 Oh, Eloise! ( Sobbing ) My life is over! Yup.
 <br>
 ( Clears Throat ) Took it like a man.
 <br>
 That was the House of Mirrors? I have more mirrors than that in my purse.
 <br>
 Why is everyone leaving? Oh, my God.
 <br>
 What time is it? Did someone ask what time it is? Yeah, we know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s fun o&#39;clock.
 <br>
 Get killed.
 <br>
 No, it&#39;s closing time, kids.
 <br>
 Time for you to go.
 <br>
 But, Woofy, we still haven&#39;t found our friend.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, golly gee, that&#39;s just too- Come on! Get out! - Except for you! ( Barking ) - ( Screams ) ( Laughing ) ( Yelps ) - All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 - What about Michael? Look, there&#39;s been lost dogs who&#39;ve traveled hundreds of miles to be reunited with their families.
 <br>
 Now, Kelso is not as smart as that but I&#39;m sure he can make it the 1 2 miles back to Forman&#39;s.
 <br>
 So, me and this girl Eloise were together for a while.
 <br>
 Everything was great.
 <br>
 But when things started getting serious, she dumped me.
 <br>
 Man, that- that hurt like hell.
 <br>
 - Did you cry? - No! No, no.
 <br>
 But there were times when I thought I would never get over it.
 <br>
 But time passed.
 <br>
 I moved on.
 <br>
 And then the day came when I didn&#39;t think about her as much.
 <br>
 Then a couple more days came along, and, why, I thought about her even less.
 <br>
 Then one day, I didn&#39;t think about her at all.
 <br>
 And then that made me sad.
 <br>
 We&#39;ve got a little Irish in us, don&#39;t we, Dad? Yes, we do.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just- It hurts.
 <br>
 You know? Listen, I&#39;m gonna give you a few days to pull yourself together.
 <br>
 You can stay in bed and sleep.
 <br>
 Watch TV.
 <br>
 Whatever you need to do.
 <br>
 Thank you, Dad.
 <br>
 And, you know not that it matters, but Donna didn&#39;t dump me.
 <br>
 I broke up with her.
 <br>
 Whatever you need to tell yourself to make it better.
 <br>
 Thanks a lot for the ride, Mrs.
 <br>
 Anderson.
 <br>
 Hey, Einstein, you gonna eat that ice cream? My name&#39;s not Einstein.
 <br>
 It&#39;s Kelso.
 <br>
 And, yeah, I&#39;m gonna eat it.
 <br>
 ( Hawks, Spits ) - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 - ( Tires Squeal ) - ( Kelso Hawks ) - Get out! - They started it! - Get out! ( Grumbles ) See ya, Einstein.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not Einstein! It&#39;s Kelso!
 <br>
