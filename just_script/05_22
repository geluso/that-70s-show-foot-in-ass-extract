<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Ah, the annual nurses&#39; convention.
 <br>
 You know, according to my bathroom reading all nurses are actually horny for high school boys.
 <br>
 Why do you think those hospital gowns have no backs? So the nurses can check out your ass.
 <br>
 Look at this sexy stampede.
 <br>
 It&#39;s like Wild Kingdom.
 <br>
 I will stalk their sexy herd like a lion.
 <br>
 I cannot run as fast, but let&#39;s see a lion put on this much cologne.
 <br>
 Oh, look, Red! All of my colleagues gathered together to talk about health and medicine.
 <br>
 And to drink until their livers turn into cocktail onions.
 <br>
 - Red, it is not that bad.
 <br>
 - Yeah? What about last year when you and your buddies took the bellboy&#39;s pants? Well, they were all wet.
 <br>
 Because you threw him in the pool! - Oh, hey, Roy.
 <br>
 - Hi, guys.
 <br>
 Oh, st-stay away from this batch of egg rolls.
 <br>
 - They were on the floor.
 <br>
 - Oh, you dropped &#39;em? No, I was lying down.
 <br>
 You know, if I were God, this is what heaven would be like- pretty girls in white and free egg rolls.
 <br>
 Fez, I thought you said heaven would be French maids with licorice hair and gumdrop nipples.
 <br>
 Oh, no, that&#39;s my 30th birthday.
 <br>
 Hi there.
 <br>
 - So, do you work here? - Yeah, I&#39;m stuck here all night.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause I&#39;ll probably be doin&#39; some things I&#39;ll regret later.
 <br>
 If you&#39;re interested.
 <br>
 Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I have a girlfriend.
 <br>
 What a coincidence.
 <br>
 I have a room.
 <br>
 You know, I don&#39;t have a girlfriend.
 <br>
 But I have, uh, written several love letters to Barbara Walters, so, uh- Oh, Roy, you&#39;re goin&#39; after the wrong ones, man.
 <br>
 You gotta think like a lion and pick off the weakest member of the herd.
 <br>
 Well, like that one, with the braces and the desperate eyes.
 <br>
 Oh, she&#39;s not makin&#39; it past sundown.
 <br>
 [Growls] Aw! Look at him.
 <br>
 All tuckered out from a day of chasing nurses.
 <br>
 Yeah, he&#39;s like a gigantic, horny baby.
 <br>
 I bet he&#39;s havin&#39; sweet dreams.
 <br>
 Welcome to the clinic for sexy foreigners.
 <br>
 Tell me where it hurts, baby.
 <br>
 Oh, I have a bad case of horniness for nurses.
 <br>
 What you need is a sexy sponge bath.
 <br>
 I like the way you operate.
 <br>
 How&#39;s that? - It&#39;s not bad.
 <br>
 - But I sure am.
 <br>
 Yes, you are, naughty nurse.
 <br>
 Maybe you need a little spanking.
 <br>
 [Michael] Maybe I do.
 <br>
 Now, why don&#39;t you turn your head and cough? Aah! - Oh, what&#39;s the problem, buddy? - Aah! - What&#39;s the problem, buddy? - Aah! ## [Rock Group Singing] ## [Ends] [Man Shouts Greeting] So, anyways, Eric, me and Joanne feel real bad since Red fired you.
 <br>
 So, we decided to get you a job on account of we&#39;re pretty sure you&#39;re not gonna be successful on your own.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that great? See, now you can save up for school, and we can get married.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 I had heard crazy rumors that sometimes parents help children but I just always thought it was some kind of beautiful fairy tale.
 <br>
 A position opened up at my company, and it&#39;s yours if you want it.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! I&#39;ll take it.
 <br>
 This is great! Yep.
 <br>
 She&#39;s as generous in real life as she is in the sack.
 <br>
 [Groans] Wow, that&#39;s wildly inappropriate.
 <br>
 So, Joanne, about my new job- [Chuckles] - I don&#39;t even know where you work.
 <br>
 - The dog-food factory.
 <br>
 The- The dog-food factory! I didn&#39;t see that comin&#39;.
 <br>
 - Hey! - Hey.
 <br>
 - How was your day? - Oh, it was brutal! How can nurses wolf down mini pizzas right after watching a film strip on butt rashes? Yeah.
 <br>
 No, I know.
 <br>
 Michael and I were hangin&#39; at The Hub - and he told me it&#39;s been tough.
 <br>
 - What? No, no, no.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t need to be hangin&#39; out with Kelso alone.
 <br>
 - Why not? - Because I don&#39;t trust him.
 <br>
 Yeah, but don&#39;t you trust me? No! Haven&#39;t you been paying attention? I don&#39;t trust anything.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t trust the government.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t trust the newspapers.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not even sure what time we think it is right now is really what time it is.
 <br>
 But most of all, I don&#39;t trust you and Kelso alone together.
 <br>
 [Sighs] All right.
 <br>
 You know what? I guess I deserve that.
 <br>
 So, I promise I won&#39;t be alone with Michael anymore.
 <br>
 However, I do think you&#39;re making a big deal out of nothing.
 <br>
 That&#39;s what you said after you yelled &#34;get off my boyfriend&#34; - when you saw Kelso kissing Annette.
 <br>
 - Okay, what do I have to do to get you to stop bringing that up? I&#39;m not doing that.
 <br>
 Then I&#39;m gonna keep bringin&#39; it up.
 <br>
 All right! Let&#39;s play some ball.
 <br>
 Why would you slap me on the butt? Is there something about me that would make you think that I, a boy, would like you, another boy, to put his hand on my butt? Uh, no? Then keep your hands to yourself, butt-slapper.
 <br>
 - [Chuckles] - Okay.
 <br>
 - Let&#39;s just play some ball.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Me and Fez are shirts.
 <br>
 You and Donna be skins? Once again, Kelso, you&#39;re not gonna fool me into being skins.
 <br>
 Loosen up, Big &#34;D.
 <br>
 &#34; Fine! We&#39;ll be skins! Oh, look at Mr.
 <br>
 Handsome taking his shirt off.
 <br>
 [Chuckles] As if that were something that I would dream about.
 <br>
 Okay, what is your problem, man? It&#39;s just- Okay.
 <br>
 Um has anyone ever had a dream where you were with a girl? Oh, hell, yeah.
 <br>
 Miss October.
 <br>
 - Hey! - And-And you know what I said to her? I said, &#34;Get the hell out of my dream, Miss October.
 <br>
 I&#39;m Donna&#39;s man.
 <br>
 &#34; Now, has any of you ever had a dream where you were with the opposite of a girl? Like two girls? Sure.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 See, I had a dream and it was erotic and it was about Kelso.
 <br>
 - What? - Wow! Wow! That is awesome! Fez, you gotta tell us about this dream.
 <br>
 Wh- No! You don&#39;t gotta! Look at him! He&#39;s undressing me with his eyes right now! You undressed yourself, you son of a bitch! Fez.
 <br>
 Tell us what happened.
 <br>
 And-And don&#39;t be afraid to use colorful words like &#34;sweaty&#34; or &#34;fondle&#34; or &#34;forbidden.
 <br>
 &#34; - Go ahead.
 <br>
 - Well Kelso was a nurse.
 <br>
 And there was sponging.
 <br>
 Oh! But, hey, maybe- maybe the dream continued, and we went to find some girls.
 <br>
 - Well, did it continue? - No! What could this mean? Well, isn&#39;t it obvious? It means that I&#39;m gay! [Whines] Why is the dog on the counter? He likes to be tall.
 <br>
 Where are you off to, honey? Oh, I&#39;m off to a little thing I like to call my new job.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Despite both your best efforts to keep me and Donna from getting married I can now afford to, because I got a new job at the dog-food factory.
 <br>
 Dog food! Well, you finally made it, Son! Hey, I&#39;ll have you know I am the coupon liaison.
 <br>
 Do you even know what you&#39;re getting yourself into? When I pass that factory on my way home from fishing I hold a dead fish up to my face, so I don&#39;t have to smell it.
 <br>
 Seriously.
 <br>
 Honey, dog food? [Whines] That is the worst part of the cow.
 <br>
 You won&#39;t last the day.
 <br>
 - [Laughs] - I will last the day.
 <br>
 And you know what? Donna and I are getting married.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m sorry, but just because of your attitude no one here will be getting the employee family discount on Pupper Supper.
 <br>
 Thank you very much.
 <br>
 Jackie! - I need to talk to you! - No.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 You have to go.
 <br>
 I cannot hang out with you anymore.
 <br>
 I promised.
 <br>
 Jackie, I need to talk to you.
 <br>
 Something happened that could tear apart the group! I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 Okay? You have to go right now.
 <br>
 Jackie, Fez had a sex dream about me.
 <br>
 You poor baby! What if he&#39;s in love with me? I don&#39;t know that I can return those feelings.
 <br>
 No, of course you can&#39;t.
 <br>
 I mean, sure, he&#39;s supercool and he&#39;s good looking and we have a ton in common.
 <br>
 - But I can&#39;t- - I know.
 <br>
 I know, baby.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 I just wonder what I did to make this happen.
 <br>
 I mean, should I have tried to be less desirable? Michael, the beautiful cannot be held responsible for the havoc our looks create.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 - Aw.
 <br>
 Come here.
 <br>
 No one understands me like you do, Jackie.
 <br>
 I told Jackie I don&#39;t want her hangin&#39; out with Kelso.
 <br>
 I walk in, they&#39;re playing couch Twister.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t know if something just happened or something was about to happen.
 <br>
 But you know what? I don&#39;t care anymore.
 <br>
 - Have you talked to her? - No! Come on, man.
 <br>
 I&#39;m done talkin&#39;.
 <br>
 I&#39;m just glad I saw them.
 <br>
 Now I can be the bigger person and bail before she does.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s what I should&#39;ve done with Lauren.
 <br>
 And Susan.
 <br>
 And Janice.
 <br>
 Ah, who am I kiddin&#39;? I&#39;m just makin&#39; these names up.
 <br>
 Hey, Roy.
 <br>
 I just need to grab my check.
 <br>
 Hey, Kelso, what the hell were you doin&#39; with my girlfriend on Donna&#39;s couch? Huh? That wasn&#39;t me.
 <br>
 I saw you! Oh.
 <br>
 Uh- Uh, well- Okay, look.
 <br>
 It wasn&#39;t what you think.
 <br>
 Um, it was totally different.
 <br>
 See, Fez had this sex dream about me.
 <br>
 And I was, like, a nurse in it.
 <br>
 And I was totally freakin&#39; out, and Jackie was just comforting me.
 <br>
 I mean, &#39;cause, you know- [Whispering] Fez had a sex dream about me.
 <br>
 So your story is that you were with Jackie because Fez had a boy-on-boy dream about you? [Chuckles] It&#39;s crazy, huh? Kelso, that is the worst lie you&#39;ve told since you claimed to be the prince of South Carolina.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m not lying about Fez&#39;s dream! Wh- I was sponging him! It&#39;s the truth! Hey, I believe people have dreams about you, man.
 <br>
 I mean, put a blond wig on, you&#39;re Goldie Hawn.
 <br>
 I know that.
 <br>
 Oh, Mr.
 <br>
 Red.
 <br>
 I need some advice.
 <br>
 I had an erotic dream about Kelso.
 <br>
 Well, Joanne, thank you for the factory tour.
 <br>
 So, um, where is the coupon liaison office? You&#39;re standing in it.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s big.
 <br>
 And, look, you have a window.
 <br>
 Maybe someday you can climb up there and look out.
 <br>
 Joanne, what exactly is the coupon liaison? [Laughs] Oh, oh! Look, girls, there&#39;s the boys! Hands off though.
 <br>
 They&#39;re minors.
 <br>
 [Inhales, Exhales] Mrs.
 <br>
 Kitty we need your medical expertise.
 <br>
 Honey, if you&#39;ve got V.
 <br>
 D.
 <br>
 , I&#39;m not looking at it.
 <br>
 No! Fez had a dream and- [Whispering] And I was doin&#39; stuff to him in it.
 <br>
 And I don&#39;t want to do it again! I&#39;m scared to let him go to sleep! See, Kelso was a nurse.
 <br>
 And I had no shirt.
 <br>
 And he had a sponge.
 <br>
 A soft one! Okay, boys dreams are- are just compilations of what you experience during the day.
 <br>
 - What did you do yesterday? - Um, Kelso and I looked at nurses.
 <br>
 Um, oh, and I ate 39 spicy egg rolls that were on the floor.
 <br>
 Well, spicy foods- there you go.
 <br>
 You know, one time, I ate stuffed peppers before I went to bed and I dreamt that I ended a war by giving the prime minister a belly dance.
 <br>
 So my dream didn&#39;t mean anything! Oh, thank God! I mean, I love you, Fez, just not in that way.
 <br>
 And my appreciation for your beauty is purely aesthetic.
 <br>
 You know what, Fez? Maybe right now is not a great time for you to be complimentin&#39; my ass.
 <br>
 Well, if it isn&#39;t the conquering hero home from a big day of dog food.
 <br>
 Hey, I had a great day, okay? And by the way, I&#39;m nowhere near the actual food.
 <br>
 I&#39;m off with, like, the executives.
 <br>
 - [Schotzie Whining] - Really? Well, Schotzie sure does love the smell of executives.
 <br>
 Okay, look.
 <br>
 Okay, maybe Eric is working with dog food but he&#39;s not complaining, and he&#39;s not quitting.
 <br>
 And we&#39;re gonna get married no matter what you think or how he smells.
 <br>
 Aw, thanks, honey.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t touch me.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 Look at you.
 <br>
 You got that great dog-food job now and plenty of dog-food money comin&#39; in, and- I mean, you two are happy, right? - Very happy.
 <br>
 - Yes.
 <br>
 - Of course you are.
 <br>
 And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve changed my mind.
 <br>
 This promising new career in dog food has convinced me that you two are mature enough to get married.
 <br>
 What? A-Are you serious? Absolutely.
 <br>
 Hey, let&#39;s get you happy kids hitched as soon as possible.
 <br>
 Like next week.
 <br>
 Next week? Wow, that&#39;s- that&#39;s really soon.
 <br>
 Yeah, l- Sooner than we thought.
 <br>
 We were thinkin&#39;, like - someday.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 - Yeah, someday.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Well, what&#39;s the matter? I mean, uh gettin&#39; engaged is a silly, fun thing to do but now that we&#39;re talking about an actual wedding you&#39;re turning into a couple of dumb-ass kids who aren&#39;t ready? &#39;Cause, I mean, if you&#39;re not ready- Heck, I got myself all excited for nothin&#39;.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 We&#39;re ready.
 <br>
 We are more than ready.
 <br>
 We&#39;re ready? Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean- Well, I am if you are.
 <br>
 Well, yeah.
 <br>
 Sure, I&#39;m completely ready.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s great.
 <br>
 You know, it&#39;s all settled.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll just- I&#39;ll go call the cake shop right now.
 <br>
 So, it&#39;s, uh, a wedding.
 <br>
 - Next week.
 <br>
 - Right.
 <br>
 - Oh, I have some homework- - Yeah, I gotta clean my room.
 <br>
 Hey, Roy, where&#39;s Steven? You know, I haven&#39;t seen him all day.
 <br>
 You got a lot of nerve showin&#39; your face around here.
 <br>
 Hyde saw you and Kelso snuggled up on the couch.
 <br>
 Tramp.
 <br>
 - Wait.
 <br>
 What? - Yeah, I said, &#34;tramp.
 <br>
 &#34; Oh, my God.
 <br>
 I have to find Steven.
 <br>
 Uh, d-don&#39;t tell him I called you a tramp.
 <br>
 I betJackie&#39;s been foolin&#39; around with Kelso this whole time.
 <br>
 I feel like an idiot.
 <br>
 Oh, my poor, little broody-brood.
 <br>
 [Laughs] You know, when I first met you you were such a cute, little guy.
 <br>
 And now you&#39;re- you&#39;re a great, big guy with- with great, big hair and- and great, big problems my little broody-brood.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 Wait, wait, wait.
 <br>
 There.
 <br>
 [Laughs] You may leave me now.
 <br>
 Hey there.
 <br>
 Still have that girlfriend? - You know what? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go talk about it.
 <br>
 Oh, hey, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, have you seen Steven? Oh, honey, I&#39;ve had a couple sips of wine, and I don&#39;t remember.
 <br>
 Oh, but you know what you need? You need more umbrellas in your hair.
 <br>
 [Laughs] Oh, bartender, we&#39;re gonna need more umbrellas.
 <br>
 Welcome to the clinic for sexy Kelsos.
 <br>
 What can I do for you? Well, I&#39;m here for my supersexy sponge bath.
 <br>
 But I have money, so if you do other stuff too- Oh, I&#39;ll do anything you want.
 <br>
 You&#39;re one good-lookin&#39; stud! Right back at ya, handsome.
 <br>
