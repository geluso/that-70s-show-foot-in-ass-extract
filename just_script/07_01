 Isn&#39;t that what elvis said right Before he died on the toilet? No, you guys, seriously, Look, rich kids do it, right? After high school, they take a year off, go to europe, Figure out what they&#39;re gonna do.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna do exactly that.

 <br>
 Just go nowhere and do nothing.
 <br>
 So you&#39;re gonna be a bum.
 <br>
 In the grandest european tradition, yes! Hey, why not? He&#39;s young, he&#39;s got a free place To live, a girl that&#39;s way too hot for him.
 <br>
 Ride the ride, baby.
 <br>
 Exactly.
 <br>
 You know, this whole marriage Thing has made me think, Why am I in such a hurry to grow up? You know, life Is like a train.
 <br>
 It&#39;s bearing down On you, and guess what.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna hit you.
 <br>
 So you can either start running when it&#39;s far off in the Distance.
 <br>
 Or you can pull up a chair, crack open a beer And just watch it come.
 <br>
 I did that once.
 <br>
 No, kelso, not a real train.
 <br>
 No, a metaphorical one.
 <br>
 - Like a.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Like a ghost train? Yes.
 <br>
 A ghost train.
 <br>
 You know, I tell you, red, I don&#39;t like this situation With bob and two women.
 <br>
 I have put up with a lot of weird things In this neighborhood Hot tubs, Wife swapping, Jogging.
 <br>
 Now I am drawing the line.
 <br>
 You have To make bob choose one woman.
 <br>
 Well, the choice is obvious.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Pam.
 <br>
 Red, this isn&#39;t your decision.
 <br>
 It&#39;s his, And he has to pick midge.
 <br>
 But pam is so tan.
 <br>
 But, red, if bob picks midge, He will reunite a shattered family, Bringing their only daughter a glimpse Of happiness for the first time in her life.
 <br>
 But pam is so tan.
 <br>
 Forman, Your whole year off plan.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 It&#39;s lazy, it&#39;s selfish and it&#39;s Gonna piss a lot of people off.
 <br>
 So nice job.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 What are you gonna do For cash, man? I mean, You know, rich kids.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 They have a trust fund.
 <br>
 Alls you&#39;ve got are some poorly Assembled model airplanes.
 <br>
 I melted those.
 <br>
 I guess if I have to work, It&#39;s not a year off, so Maybe I can sell something.
 <br>
 Guys, What do I have that&#39;s worth any money? Oh, donna, I can sell Your engagement ring.
 <br>
 She&#39;s going to kill him.
 <br>
 Fez, get out of the swing zone.
 <br>
 I got 10 bucks on the girl, And I mean donna.
 <br>
 Actually, I have no problem With you selling it.
 <br>
 Donna, You are so amazing.
 <br>
 I swear, if I created you in a laboratory, You could not say more perfect things.
 <br>
 Yeah, but then she&#39;d have those Bolts coming out of her neck.
 <br>
 Well, the only problem is I don&#39;t have the ring.
 <br>
 What? Well, when I was mad at you for blowing off The wedding, I threw it off the water tower.
 <br>
 Donna, that ring is a symbol of Our eternal love for each other.
 <br>
 You were gonna sell it to finance A year of napping and boozing.
 <br>
 Yeah, that&#39;s true, Sowho&#39;s wrong here? I think there&#39;s a little something Wrong with all of us.
 <br>
 Okay, uh, well, if you threw the ring from up here, It&#39;s gotta be around here somewhere.
 <br>
 All right,excuse me.
 <br>
 I am a police officer in training, So we&#39;re gonna do this by the book.
 <br>
 What book? You didn&#39;t read any book.
 <br>
 No, but I was assigned one.
 <br>
 Killed four bees with it.
 <br>
 All right, what we&#39;re gonna do Is we&#39;re gonna recreate the scene.
 <br>
 Donna, eric has just let you down in a big way.
 <br>
 You&#39;re up on this tower.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve had a few beers, So you&#39;re starting to feel a little loose And very, very vulnerable.
 <br>
 - okay, that sounds about right.
 <br>
 - okay.
 <br>
 Do you wanna make out? Kelso, I thought you werere creating the scene.
 <br>
 I&#39;m taking the scene in a new direction.
 <br>
 Okay, okay, let&#39;s just get to The part where she threw the ring.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So what we&#39;re gonna do here is we&#39;re gonna throw an m&amp;m into the woods in place of the ring.
 <br>
 Wherever it lands, we&#39;ll search there first.
 <br>
 Fez, give him the m&amp;ms, man.
 <br>
 Yeah, about that whose dumb idea was it tolet me hold the m&amp;ms? All right.
 <br>
 Instead of the candy, we will throw my keys into the woods.
 <br>
 Oh, crap.
 <br>
 I just threw my keys into the woods! Sure did.
 <br>
 Why didn&#39;t somebody say something? So that you&#39;d throw your keys into the woods.
 <br>
 Oh, that&#39;s a good burn.
 <br>
 I had very little to do with it.
 <br>
 Okay, bob, what the hell are you doing up on your roof? Hiding from my girlfriends.
 <br>
 This afternoon we were all talking about our favorite juices.
 <br>
 Pam said her favorite juice was cranberry.
 <br>
 Midge said she liked apple.
 <br>
 To avoid trouble, I said my favorite was cran-apple.
 <br>
 They viewed that as cheating, and now I&#39;m on the roof.
 <br>
 Kitty and I think that you should choose between pam and midge.
 <br>
 And when I say : &#34;kitty and I&#34;, I mean just kitty.
 <br>
 And when I say : &#34;choose between pam and midge&#34;, I mean choose pam.
 <br>
 It&#39;s tough.
 <br>
 I really love pam.
 <br>
 But midge is donna&#39;s mother.
 <br>
 How can I turn my back on that? Look, just give me a name.
 <br>
 I gotta take something back to kitty.
 <br>
 So don&#39;t go home.
 <br>
 Stay here.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not gonna spend the day hiding on the roof like a damn pigeon.
 <br>
 I got beer.
 <br>
 Well, it is  peaceful up here.
 <br>
 All right, did anybody find anything? I found a pair of my sister&#39;s panties.
 <br>
 I knew they were hers because they had her name and phone number in them.
 <br>
 A girl&#39;s gotta advertise.
 <br>
 You guys, I&#39;m starving, okay? I haven&#39;t eaten all day.
 <br>
 - Here.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Oh, thanks, fez.
 <br>
 Yeah, good cheetos.
 <br>
 Really? &#39;Cause I found the min the woods, and they were damp.
 <br>
 Like something peed on them.
 <br>
 Awesome! Eric ate pee-tos! Okay, look, I don&#39;t wanna start anything, but had you bought donna a decent-sized diamond, we would have found it by now.
 <br>
 The ring was pretty small, man.
 <br>
 Whenever I saw it, I thought donna was really far away.
 <br>
 She was standing right next to me.
 <br>
 Yeah, when I first saw it, I said, &#34;donna, there&#39;s dust on your ring.
 <br>
 &#34; Then I realized that was the ring.
 <br>
 Guys, guys, stop.
 <br>
 If we don&#39;t find it soon, a mosquito&#39;s going to eat it.
 <br>
 Okay, I love the ring.
 <br>
 It was petite, not showy.
 <br>
 Thank you.
 <br>
 Well, you know, donna has a thing for miniatures.
 <br>
 Okay, you guys, enough about the ring.
 <br>
 Obviously, it was enough for me to pay for my year off.
 <br>
 And according to &#34;Esquire&#34;, sweater vest are in.
 <br>
 Wow Jackie, help.
 <br>
 Oh, get away! You touched pee-tos! He touched pee-tos! you know what? Falling off that water tower was a sign.
 <br>
 The minute I stopped working hard, I accomplished exactly what I needed to do.
 <br>
 I found the ring.
 <br>
 And if you&#39;re gonna land on a diamond, it&#39;s best to land on the smallest one ever made.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m afraid your school yard insults have no power here, child.
 <br>
 I&#39;m a whole new me tougher, braver and louder! I&#39;m gonna tell my dad what&#39;s what and get my gosh-darn fried chicken.
 <br>
 Okay, donna, here&#39;s the situation.
 <br>
 I have to choose between pam and midge, and it&#39;s a very personal and intimate decision that only I can make.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really scary, so I&#39;d like you to do it.
 <br>
 Dad, I can&#39;t choose for you.
 <br>
 Come on, you choose my shirts.
 <br>
 Choose my lady love.
 <br>
 Mom, where are you going? Bob, I saw how hard you struggled to get on the roof earlier.
 <br>
 What with the kicking and the wiggling, I realized it was time for me to go home and give you and midge a chance.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re one fine lady.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll miss you, bob.
 <br>
 And, honey, it&#39;s scary to be on my own, but if you come with me, I know I can do it.
 <br>
 Oh, mom, I would love to come home with you! Oh, good.
 <br>
 You&#39;re the only one who can explain things to the maid.
 <br>
 Okay, I&#39;m here to earn my dinner.
 <br>
 What am I doing about donna? We&#39;re hanging out.
 <br>
 What am I doing about my job? I quit.
 <br>
 What am I doing about my future? Nothing.
 <br>
 When am I moving out? Make me.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, fez, I think I have something in my eye.
 <br>
 Is it donna&#39;s engagement ring? No, no, it&#39;s too big for that.
 <br>
 Hey, maybe we should get some doctors&#39; masks so we don&#39;t accidentally inhale donna&#39;s ring.
 <br>
 Okay, okay, donna, you thought the engagement ring was big enough, right? Burn! - I didn&#39;t say anything.
 <br>
 - So say something.
 <br>
 - It could have been bigger.
 <br>
 - Burn!
 <br>
