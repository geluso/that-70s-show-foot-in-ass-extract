 ( No Audible Dialogue ) Guess what.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Nobody guess.
 <br>
 It&#39;s always about boobs.
 <br>
 Oh, come on.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you want to know what I have to say? Man, I never know what you have to say.
 <br>
 I mean, in your head you&#39;re speaking English but when it comes out, it&#39;s all buzzes and clicks.
 <br>
 Oh, really? Well, I guess I was speaking English to the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s because I got 1 ,000 points.
 <br>
 Oh, and last night on cable I saw four boobs.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 So the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s are in? Donna, did you see your scores yet? - Yeah.
 <br>
 This morning.
 <br>
 I got a 1 230.
 <br>
 - What? A 1 230? That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 Why didn&#39;t you say something? Well, I didn&#39;t want to brag.
 <br>
 I mean, yeah, I kicked ass, but it&#39;s no big deal.
 <br>
 Eric.
 <br>
 Eric, honey.
 <br>
 I got the mail and your S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 envelope happened to be open and the letter just sort of slid into my hand and I accidentally put on my reading glasses, and I saw your score.
 <br>
 You got an 800.
 <br>
 I got an 800? That&#39;s it? &#39;&#39;That&#39;s it?&#39;&#39; If one hundred&#39;s an &#39;&#39;A,&#39;&#39; eight of them is an A-plus-plus.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 No, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 An 800&#39;s not good.
 <br>
 I mean, a pigeon can peck a better score than that.
 <br>
 Really? Donna did better.
 <br>
 Fez did too.
 <br>
 And his whole country&#39;s made of bamboo.
 <br>
 This is awkward.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) I&#39;ll just, um- I&#39;ll go home and take down the streamers.
 <br>
 Forman, the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s prove nothing.
 <br>
 I got a 950, and I don&#39;t even have any textbooks.
 <br>
 Or a locker.
 <br>
 Wait, wait.
 <br>
 A 950? Steven, I knew it.
 <br>
 You do have potential.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Imagine what I could do if I only applied myself.
 <br>
 Oh, well.
 <br>
 Guess we&#39;ll never know.
 <br>
 I just- I can&#39;t believe I got the lowest score here.
 <br>
 Oh, Eric, someone had to come in last.
 <br>
 There is no shame in that.
 <br>
 Well, there is a little shame.
 <br>
 Shame on you.
 <br>
 - ( Chuckling ) - Hey.
 <br>
 You know, who cares what anyone got? It&#39;s just a stupid test.
 <br>
 You know what? You&#39;re right.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 - I got a 1 030! - ( Wails ) - ( Sobbing ) - Yeah! I did good on a test, man.
 <br>
 Something&#39;s happening to me.
 <br>
 I&#39;m blooming like a flower.
 <br>
 Whoo-hoo! So the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s proved it.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s the smart one.
 <br>
 Eric, on the other hand- Well, I don&#39;t wanna say there&#39;s a dumb one but there&#39;s two, and he ain&#39;t the smart one.
 <br>
 That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, Bob.
 <br>
 Eric got an A-plus-plus.
 <br>
 Oh, uh no, see, uh, Red it turns out Eric still did very well.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just, some other people did better.
 <br>
 - Donna? - Yes.
 <br>
 - Steven? - Yes.
 <br>
 Not the foreign kid.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 Kelso? Yes.
 <br>
 He did worse than Kelso? I watched that kid glue his hand to his face.
 <br>
 You.
 <br>
 What happened on the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s? Okay, you know he&#39;s not good under pressure.
 <br>
 He can&#39;t pee in a public restroom because there&#39;s an audience.
 <br>
 You know what? This is a family thing.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll leave you to it.
 <br>
 What&#39;s wrong with you? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 Maybe I&#39;m not smart.
 <br>
 - Who says you&#39;re not smart? - You.
 <br>
 When? Always.
 <br>
 Your problem is you got your head up your ass.
 <br>
 Your father&#39;s afraid that you&#39;re spending a little too much time on a high school romance.
 <br>
 That&#39;s right.
 <br>
 Donna gums up the works.
 <br>
 Whoa.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not her fault, okay? I was prepared for that test.
 <br>
 I had three sharp pencils.
 <br>
 That&#39;s one more than recommended, by the way.
 <br>
 I remember sitting there, filling out the little bubbles- ( Tires Squealing ) - Well, that was a blast.
 <br>
 - Sure was.
 <br>
 Now why don&#39;t you point yourself toward my villa and park this thing in my garage? Oh, I&#39;m planning on that, but what should I do with the car? We better hurry.
 <br>
 We only have five minutes.
 <br>
 Well, that&#39;s four more than I need, baby.
 <br>
 ( Woman ) I repeat: There&#39;s only five minutes left in this section of the test.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 Donna does gum up the works.
 <br>
 See? Now use what little brains you&#39;ve got and hit the books, dumb-ass.
 <br>
 Kelso, what the hell are you doing with a book? Reading.
 <br>
 ( Both Laugh ) I am reading.
 <br>
 &#39;Cause what good is having brains if you got nothing up here? - Hi.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 So I saw my dad in prison today.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 How was it? Well, at first it was a downer but then I realized that I&#39;ll be okay without my dad because the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s prove that there&#39;s another man who can take care of me.
 <br>
 You better be talking about Santa Claus.
 <br>
 No, Steven, I&#39;m talking about you.
 <br>
 Because you have potential.
 <br>
 He doesn&#39;t have potential.
 <br>
 I have potential.
 <br>
 Like, I&#39;m reading Moby Dick, and I&#39;m not even halfway through and I can already tell you the ending.
 <br>
 The whale is a robot.
 <br>
 Steven,just imagine what your life would be like with the love and support of a good woman.
 <br>
 ( Chamber) Oh! Thank God for your strong S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s.
 <br>
 Now we don&#39;t have to be poor.
 <br>
 Not poor, indeed.
 <br>
 Basic math and verbal skills are the ticket to great wealth - and therefore great happiness.
 <br>
 - Oh.
 <br>
 Poor person! Bring me a fancy cocktail.
 <br>
 It is my privilege to wait on you, madam.
 <br>
 Oh, quite so, quite so.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Enough with the idle chatter.
 <br>
 Go be poor.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Someone&#39;s playing the harp in the corner? &#39;Cause if I&#39;m rich, I&#39;m hiring, like,Jethro Tull.
 <br>
 Who cares? It&#39;s the same thing every time- I&#39;m a butler, I&#39;m a bellhop, I&#39;m a stable boy.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;ve had enough.
 <br>
 I will not wait on you people anymore.
 <br>
 Got it? Good.
 <br>
 Now who wants a Popsicle? Wow.
 <br>
 Here&#39;s something I did not know.
 <br>
 They number every page.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 You guys.
 <br>
 You know how Red&#39;s always telling me I need to buckle down? It turns out he&#39;s right.
 <br>
 I do have to buckle down.
 <br>
 You sure do.
 <br>
 He&#39;s got an 800.
 <br>
 There&#39;s your butler.
 <br>
 Man, how can I ever marry Donna? I mean, I&#39;m an idiot around her now, and we&#39;re only engaged.
 <br>
 ( Together) What? Oops.
 <br>
 - You&#39;re engaged? - ( Chuckling ) No.
 <br>
 How could you give her that ring? You&#39;re in high school, man, and according to the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s that&#39;s about as far as you&#39;re gonna go.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Just don&#39;t tell Donna I told you, okay? She&#39;d kill me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s supposed to be a secret.
 <br>
 Of course she wants it a secret.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;I&#39;m marrying dumb guy.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Who wants that spread around? You know, maybe Eric&#39;s bad score is a blessing.
 <br>
 It&#39;ll be a good story when he&#39;s a senator.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Senator&#39;&#39;? The word you&#39;re looking for is &#39;&#39;janitor.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Okay, see? That&#39;s why Eric did so poorly on that test.
 <br>
 It&#39;s because you&#39;re too hard on him.
 <br>
 I have to be hard on him, &#39;cause you always baby him.
 <br>
 - Because you&#39;re so hard on him.
 <br>
 - You babied him before I was hard on him.
 <br>
 - Because you&#39;re so hard on him.
 <br>
 - You babied him before I was hard on him.
 <br>
 You were hard on him when he was a baby.
 <br>
 Hey, I just found out I can take the S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 &#39;s again.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna- I&#39;m gonna take it again, and I&#39;m gonna nail it.
 <br>
 I just gotta buckle down.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna kick a little S.
 <br>
 A.
 <br>
 T.
 <br>
 butt.
 <br>
 - Attaboy.
 <br>
 - Good for you.
 <br>
 Think he&#39;ll do any better? - Eh.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 Hi.
 <br>
 What are you doing? Studying.
 <br>
 I&#39;d love to hang out, but I&#39;ve really gotta buckle down.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Can I raid the fridge? My dad wrote &#39;&#39;Save for Bob&#39;&#39; on all the food at our house.
 <br>
 Oops.
 <br>
 I dropped the margarine.
 <br>
 Butterfingers.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so slippery I can barely get my fingers around it.
 <br>
 ( Sniffs ) Uh, I gotta go.
 <br>
 - Ground me.
 <br>
 - What? I am not strong enough.
 <br>
 If I&#39;m gonna shake this Donna thing I am gonna need some serious discipline.
 <br>
 Please ground me.
 <br>
 You got it, pal.
 <br>
 You&#39;re grounded.
 <br>
 One more thing.
 <br>
 Donna&#39;s in the kitchen.
 <br>
 - I need you to get rid of her for me.
 <br>
 - Do I have to be nice about it? - No.
 <br>
 - This is the happiest day of my life.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 Hey, Steven.
 <br>
 Great news.
 <br>
 I found a couple savings bonds - and I can cash them in to help you pay for college.
 <br>
 -Jackie- ( Gasps ) You&#39;re going to college? I am so happy.
 <br>
 ( Laughs ) You were an orphan, and we took you in.
 <br>
 And now look at you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m proud of you.
 <br>
 And that money that you&#39;ve been paying in rent? I put it in a bank account for college.
 <br>
 Or bail.
 <br>
 But this is better.
 <br>
 Okay, enough.
 <br>
 Jackie, college is a waste of time, and I&#39;m not going, okay? - So just butt the hell out.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No, Steven, I won&#39;t butt out because you need to be pushed, and we need to think about our future.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Even if we have a future, it&#39;s not gonna be what you wanted.
 <br>
 It&#39;s gonna be more like- Steven, do you think I&#39;m fat? I know you&#39;re fat.
 <br>
 Go get me a beer.
 <br>
 ( Grunts ) - Oh, my God.
 <br>
 - Yeah.
 <br>
 It ain&#39;t pretty.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Please tell me they won&#39;t be living in our basement.
 <br>
 Well, we&#39;ll be dead by then.
 <br>
 Oh, good.
 <br>
 You grounded yourself? What? Why would I do that? Well, apparently, I &#39;&#39;gum up the works.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh, good.
 <br>
 So someone filled you in.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Red-when he kicked me out of your kitchen.
 <br>
 And then he locked the sliding door and stood there laughing and waving.
 <br>
 Eric, why are you freaking out about this test? I&#39;m not.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna take it again, and I&#39;m gonna nail it.
 <br>
 Anything less than a 1 2 40 is unacceptable.
 <br>
 A 1 2 40? Hmm.
 <br>
 That&#39;s 1 0 more points than I got.
 <br>
 Really? That&#39;s weird.
 <br>
 You&#39;re threatened because I got a better score than you.
 <br>
 - I just- I have to do better than you.
 <br>
 - Why? Because I&#39;m the man, and the man&#39;s the man and that&#39;s just the way it is.
 <br>
 What did you say? Uh- I&#39;m grounded.
 <br>
 Dad! Donna&#39;s up here.
 <br>
 - That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 - What&#39;s it? This chapter just helped me figure out the answer to you and Donna&#39;s problem, vis-a-vis your crappy score.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39;Vis-a-vis&#39;&#39;? It&#39;s a PBS word, Eric.
 <br>
 Stay with me here.
 <br>
 Yeah, I liken your situation to that of Pavlov&#39;s dog.
 <br>
 You see, Pavlov was this science guy and every time his dog would ring a bell, Pavlov would eat.
 <br>
 Are you sure it was the dog who rang the bell? Yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, who else would it be? Pavlov? Well, that wouldn&#39;t be a trick, Eric.
 <br>
 What man can&#39;t ring a bell? Anyway, every time that dog would ring that bell old Pavlov would eat, and then he would drool.
 <br>
 You just read that chapter two seconds ago.
 <br>
 - Do you even want my help? - No! Your loss.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 So what&#39;s wrong with you and Donna? She did better than me on that test and I&#39;m sorry, but that is just not gonna fly because I am the man and the man&#39;s the man, and that&#39;s just the way it is.
 <br>
 Well, honey, everybody has different skills.
 <br>
 I do better on tests than your father but he&#39;s the one brave enough to kill spiders.
 <br>
 And since we&#39;ve been married, how many tests have I taken? None.
 <br>
 How many spiders has your father killed? Hundreds.
 <br>
 But, Mom, spiders freak me out.
 <br>
 We all have different qualities.
 <br>
 But the thing to remember is how you do on some silly test is much less important than how you behave in real life.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll take a dummy over a jackass any day.
 <br>
 So am I a dummy or a jackass? Well, honey, right now you&#39;re both.
 <br>
 Okay, Steven, about your vision of our future with you swilling beer and me being fat? That&#39;s not gonna happen, because I&#39;m not gonna be fat.
 <br>
 It&#39;s genetic.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true.
 <br>
 Her mother drinks two bottles of wine a day and she looks damn good.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;ve seen her vacuum in her underwear.
 <br>
 - So what&#39;s your point? - My point is she&#39;s frickin&#39; hot.
 <br>
 Not you.
 <br>
 All I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;ve become accustomed to a certain lifestyle and if you would just live up to your potential- I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re talking to 950 guy over there.
 <br>
 I got a 1 030.
 <br>
 I got 80 more potential.
 <br>
 Yeah, but Steven has my heart- Which is why I want him to be rich.
 <br>
 I mean, think about all the stuff you could buy for me.
 <br>
 Jackie why don&#39;t you earn your own money and buy those things yourself? Myself? And I&#39;m not like Forman.
 <br>
 I have no problem mooching off your success.
 <br>
 You know, you leave the room, I steal some money from your purse.
 <br>
 You pretend I didn&#39;t, but we both know I did.
 <br>
 That&#39;s the future I see for us.
 <br>
 Oh, Steven, that&#39;s beautiful.
 <br>
 Oh, wait.
 <br>
 So you don&#39;t even care that I did better than him? Not really.
 <br>
 Well, if being smart isn&#39;t gonna help me impress the chicks then I want no part of it.
 <br>
 I&#39;m gonna go back to coasting through life on my good looks.
 <br>
 Hey, and my brains will always be there so if I ever need &#39;em I&#39;ll just whip &#39;em out and use &#39;em like a secret emergency rocket pack.
 <br>
 That&#39;s a good plan, man.
 <br>
 Hey, it beats the hell out of reading.
 <br>
 - Okay, Donna, look.
 <br>
 - Don&#39;t worry, Eric.
 <br>
 I&#39;m only reading the funnies.
 <br>
 Business section&#39;s for the man, right? Donna, the thing is, I&#39;m a jackass and I know it.
 <br>
 Well, I know it too.
 <br>
 Look.
 <br>
 Okay, the only reason I said what I said is- You agreed to marry me before the facts were in, right? So now I&#39;m thinking that maybe, you know you might want to trade up.
 <br>
 That&#39;s so stupid.
 <br>
 Okay, I swear to God, if one more person calls me stupid today- Eric- Eric, my entire life everywhere I&#39;ve gone and everything I&#39;ve done has been better because you were there with me and no test score is gonna change that.
 <br>
 Wow.
 <br>
 That was amazing.
 <br>
 Did you come up with that yourself? Well, I saw Mr.
 <br>
 Ingalls say it to Mary on Little House on the Prairie.
 <br>
 - Hmm.
 <br>
 - I just made it a test score instead of blindness.
 <br>
 But I- I still think it&#39;s true.
 <br>
 So, you&#39;re still glad we&#39;re engaged? Of course.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 Hey, speaking of Little House- Did you ever see that one where Laura accidentally told Kelso, Hyde, Fez and Jackie that she was engaged to Donna? Eric, are you kidding me? God.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t even keep a secret? Hey, Donna, I got an 800.
 <br>
 We&#39;re lucky I can wash myself, okay? Poor person! Where&#39;s my drink? Where&#39;s your drink? What about my drink? Next time you ask where your drink is, it will be in your ass.
 <br>
 It&#39;s so hard to get good poor people these days.
 <br>
