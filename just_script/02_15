 Oh Reruns not smart.
 <br>
 Whats Happening? Ill tell you whats happeninghilarity.
 <br>
 Yeah no kidding.
 <br>
 Hey Hey Hey! Thats just funny man.
 <br>
 Hey, hey can you guys keep it down a bit please? Hyde theres lipstick on your chin.
 <br>
 Hyde, why are you putting lipstick on your chin? Its for your lips.
 <br>
 Hey, maybe hes got a girl back there.
 <br>
 So Hyde, whos the lucky lady? I never kiss and tell.
 <br>
 Its Kat Peterson.
 <br>
 Yeah right, youre in your bedroom with the most popular girl in school.
 <br>
 Yeah, what happened to Farrah Fawcett? Did her car break down? Look, just keep it down alright? Youre killing the mood.
 <br>
 Hyde theres no mood because theres no one back there.
 <br>
 Hey Michael.
 <br>
 Ok so were all set for our big dinner party! Oh yea, the big dinner party.
 <br>
 So here You and a guest are cordially invited for an evening of cocktails, dinner, and TV.
 <br>
  The attire is semi-formal-casual.
 <br>
 Ah, finally I can wear my tuxedo T-shirt.
 <br>
 Uh sorry Fez, I forgot to invite you and Hyde.
 <br>
 Oh, but its never too late.
 <br>
 Ok bye! Dont worry Fez, Im sure you and Hyde can come.
 <br>
 No Michael, they cant.
 <br>
 Ok, I get it.
 <br>
 They cant come.
 <br>
 Come with me.
 <br>
 Nooo!! Ok, Ill give you a hundred bucks if you dont make me go to this party.
 <br>
 - Show me the hundred.
 <br>
 - Damn!! Well, the partys tomorrow night so I better go home and start putting on cologne now.
 <br>
 KAT: So, that was fun.
 <br>
 No, Disneyland is fun, that was nasty.
 <br>
 Oh my god Hyde, Kat Peterson, nice.
 <br>
 Yup, shes slumin it, Im lovin it.
 <br>
 Red, Honey, would you go to Bob and Midges and get my casserole dish? Im making Tuna Surprise tonight.
 <br>
 Well now that I know, youve ruined the surprise.
 <br>
 Its for Scrabble night.
 <br>
 Bob and Midge love Tuna Surprise.
 <br>
 Yeah, but I dont love Bob and Midge.
 <br>
 Well Red I have to keep inviting them over, they keep inviting us.
 <br>
 Thats because you keep inviting them.
 <br>
 Somebodys got to break the chain or itll go on forever.
 <br>
 Red, theyre the only friends we have since you made Phyllis cry.
 <br>
 I didnt say anything about Phyllis weight that the whole room didnt already know.
 <br>
 Donna, Im going to have dinner parties all the time when Im Mrs.
 <br>
 Michael Kelso, Esquire.
 <br>
 Just think about it.
 <br>
 - Do it have to? - Oh shhh.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 So theres sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden starlight and  your eyes are blue Theyre brown.
 <br>
 I know.
 <br>
 Oh Kelso, you little so and so.
 <br>
 Id nary a notion of your songbird ways, having thought you merely a captain of industry and a king among men.
 <br>
 Eric, cease your fawning and let us discuss the fox hunt.
 <br>
 But first, I crave a French pastry, wheres the help? Apologies good sire, I was in the stables brushing the horses, secretly entertaining the notion of a sensual tryst with a lady.
 <br>
 Top drawer! Top drawer! top drawer.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 Hello?? Oh, hey Bob.
 <br>
 Oh, hi Red.
 <br>
 Stop it! You know what might make this party a little more fun? Sweet death.
 <br>
 Hyde! Fez! MICHAEL!! Oh good, its Hyde, Fez, and Michael.
 <br>
 Hello fellas, whats to eat? Are these melon balls for anyone? Why are they here? I invited them because youre always discussing manners and I wanted to be mannerly.
 <br>
 Hes mannerly.
 <br>
 Hey Chuck! Oh no, Chucks here.
 <br>
 Why? Why Michael? Why would invite all these people? Why would you do this? Well, I was thinking that if a party with 10 people was fun, then a party with 30 people would be twice as much fun.
 <br>
 Michael, I didnt want twice as much fun, I wanted a small, classy party.
 <br>
 Jackie, just because theres a couple more people doesnt mean it cant still be classy.
 <br>
 TIMMY: Hey everybody, Im taking off my pants!! No hair? Nonewell, a little.
 <br>
 Well what are we talking about here Red? Is it Ed Asner bald or Charlie Brown bald? Geez Kitty, I dont know.
 <br>
 I barely looked.
 <br>
 Ok I need a visual aid.
 <br>
 It was so uncomfortable.
 <br>
 I mean, a toupee is a pretty big lie, Kitty.
 <br>
 Ok here, show me on Wooly Willy.
 <br>
 Uh huh, ok, uh huh Really?? Hey, hey, would it kill you to use a coaster? Bunch of wild hooligans here.
 <br>
 Oh, sorry Red.
 <br>
 Well, you know, it was gonna leave a ring.
 <br>
 Thats so true Kitty.
 <br>
 Eric, look this isnt your house.
 <br>
 You arent going to get in trouble for any of this so loosen up.
 <br>
 Yeah, I guess I could do that.
 <br>
 Oh my god, its like Im seeing colors Ive never seen before.
 <br>
 Hey Kat, want a beer? KAT: Nothanks She just blew me off man? Do you believe that? Yes I do.
 <br>
 I really, really do.
 <br>
 Michael, are they drinking out of my parents crystal? Yeah Jackie, they were trying to drink straight from the bottle and I said No, no, use the crystal, cause its classy.
 <br>
  Michael Im going to go upstairs and feel sorry for myself and you, you are gonna fix this.
 <br>
 Fix it? Jackie, youre having the party of the year here.
 <br>
 Damn, I do not get women! Yes, neither does Hyde, right Hyde? You ok? Donna please, I really dont want to talk about Michael.
 <br>
 Ok, so what is your honest opinion about Michael? Umm, by honest you mean Donna, please learn to listen.
 <br>
 Ok fine, honestly, you have certain expectations of Kelso that may not be entirely realistic.
 <br>
 You want him to be sophisticated and smart, but actually hes unsophisticated and unsmart.
 <br>
 RANDOM GUY: Hey you guys are really bringing down the make out room.
 <br>
 Well, Im gonna have to pass, Ive got nothing.
 <br>
 Would you look at her Fez, acting like shes hot stuff? So shes really good looking and everyone likes her, Im real impressed.
 <br>
 Yeah, I know how it is.
 <br>
 You think you know somebody, but then it turns out he lied about making out with Kat Peterson.
 <br>
 Hyde! Fez! What is this a funeral? Why arent you guys getting down? Well my friend, Hyde is way too lovesick to get down.
 <br>
 Love sick? I dont love her man.
 <br>
 I just think we should be having sex and all because shed enjoy it.
 <br>
 Hyde, Im not a doctor, but I play one on TV.
 <br>
 But seriously Hyde, this is a party, so loosen up Like me, whoopsie daisy! Man, I wish Jackie would loosen up.
 <br>
 Shes throwing a great party down here and shes missing it.
 <br>
 Kelso you dont get it, huh? This party meant the world to Jackie and you crapped on it.
 <br>
 Alright, ease up on Kelso, huh? Thanks Hyde.
 <br>
 Yeah, so you did something horrible, but its Jackie, so who cares? No wait, what are you saying? Im saying you burned her man, royally.
 <br>
 Nice job.
 <br>
 But no, man, I didnt want to burn her.
 <br>
 I invited all these people to make it fun, so the party would be good.
 <br>
 She didnt want a good party, she wanted her party.
 <br>
 You know what? Youre right Fez.
 <br>
 Alright, this partys over.
 <br>
 Everybody out! No, Kelso, what are you saying man? Think! You know what guys? For the first time in my life, I think I am thinking.
 <br>
 You know Im in danger of ruining the greatest thing thats ever happened to me and I am not going to let that happen.
 <br>
 Kelso Do not interrupt me, this is important! From now on, Im going to put Jackies needs first and shes going to be so proud of me! Whoa! WHOA MAN, THIS IS A RAGER! Give me your brandies.
 <br>
 WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! God, how dare you say that about me and Michael!? Jackie, you wanted my honest opinion.
 <br>
 Your honest opinion that were great together.
 <br>
 Look, you were wrong about Michael.
 <br>
 He knows he made a mistake and hes going to make it up to me.
 <br>
 You wait and see.
 <br>
 Uh Jackie, wheres the fire extinguisher? S-I-T.
 <br>
 Thats sit.
 <br>
  Oh my, yes it isagain.
 <br>
 Yeah, Midge has got quite a lead.
 <br>
 Your turn Red.
 <br>
 Ok fine.
 <br>
 Cue ball Im sorry Bob, I uh.
 <br>
 Sorry? Why apologize to me? I like billiards.
 <br>
 Billiards are fun.
 <br>
 Ok, so you all know.
 <br>
 I dont know anything.
 <br>
 I wear a toupee.
 <br>
 Bob! If you tell them, theyll know! I wear a rug, so what? You know.
 <br>
 .
 <br>
 I wish I had a toupee.
 <br>
 You know, because you know, the way my hair is sometimes.
 <br>
 Look Bob, being isnt something a man has to hide from.
 <br>
 A toupee is just silly.
 <br>
 I keep telling him that if he grew as much hair on his head as he does on his back, hed have a full head of hair! I know its silly, I guess Im vain.
 <br>
 Every morning I wake up wishing I had the courage to walk around looking like you.
 <br>
 But I dont, Red.
 <br>
 I dont.
 <br>
 I guess that makes me a bad person.
 <br>
 Look Bob, I didnt mean to make you.
 <br>
 No, no, you know what? Youre right Red, youre right.
 <br>
 Maybe its time I stop living the lie.
 <br>
 Sinuses.
 <br>
 Alright, alright.
 <br>
 I was wrong, you need the toupee.
 <br>
 Put it back on.
 <br>
 Hey, hey Donna, I wanna sing to you, hey hey hey Donna, no one else will ever do, Ive waited so long for school to be through, Donna, Donna, I love you hey hey Donna!! Eric, get down off there right now! Whats the problem Donna? TIMMY: Yeah, whats the problem Donna? Timmy, go get your pants on or Ill beat the crap out of you! Eric, remember when I told you to loosen up? Oh yeah baby.
 <br>
 Well, tighten up baby.
 <br>
 When the house is on fire, the partys over.
 <br>
 Well, hey, this was your idea.
 <br>
 Eric, I told you to loosen up, not act like a dink.
 <br>
 Well Im new at this so sue me.
 <br>
 Sue, sue, sue me!! Sue me Donna! Eric! KAT: Hello Steven.
 <br>
 Oh, I see how this is gonna be.
 <br>
 So when youre with your little clique, youre too good for me.
 <br>
 KAT: Right, but theyre gone now, so.
 <br>
 hi.
 <br>
 You know, for a rich girl, youre kind of skanky.
 <br>
 Come on, let me show you the garage.
 <br>
 That proves nothing! Son of a bitch.
 <br>
 Wait Jackie, I owe you an apology.
 <br>
 I just wanted to help tonight and I guess I blew it.
 <br>
 Im sorry.
 <br>
 Yeah, lately youve been sorry a lot Michael.
 <br>
 Yeah, but this time I mean it.
 <br>
 Actually, he does.
 <br>
 He felt very bad and said tender words about you and then, he set your house on fire.
 <br>
 See he loves you, but hes just, hes just stupid.
 <br>
 - Thank you Fez.
 <br>
 - Sure.
 <br>
 Jackie, I do love you and Ill do whatever it takes to make you happy with me.
 <br>
 Yeah, well Im beginning to think that youre never going to make me happy.
 <br>
 What are you saying? Im saying I have a lot of thinking to do.
 <br>
 Whoo, dodged a bullet there, huh Fez? Nothing good came out of this night, although I did find out that brandys flammable.
 <br>
 Yeah, thats worth knowing.
 <br>
 Oh and uh, gasoline for future reference.
 <br>
 I just dont get chicks, man.
 <br>
 God Donna, men are stupid.
 <br>
 How can they not know what we want? I think they know what we want, but they just wont give it to us.
 <br>
 You know? Its so simple.
 <br>
 Yeah, its confusing, huh? Oh my god, the most horrifying moment, Eric sang to me.
 <br>
 Hey, I sang to Donna.
 <br>
 Yeah, she kinda melted.
 <br>
 I mean, she called me a dink, but I dont think she meant it.
 <br>
 Eric was such a dink tonight.
 <br>
 And I mean it.
 <br>
 Totally.
 <br>
