<div class="scrolling-script-container">
 Hey.
 <br>
 Check it out.
 <br>
 I got my first story in the school paper.
 <br>
 Neat.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 They spelled your name wrong.
 <br>
 Apparently you&#39;re &#34;Donna Pincipotti.
 <br>
 &#34; That&#39;s funny &#39;cause it&#39;s got the potty sound in it.
 <br>
 Hey, you know what else is a funny sound? Where the hell is Jackie with your van, man? - I want to get out of here.
 <br>
 - Ah, she had to help her aunt move a couch.
 <br>
 Why did you lend Jackie your van? She hates you, man.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m trying to get on her good side, Fez.
 <br>
 I mean, this is a small town with a limited number of women.
 <br>
 And I&#39;ve already gone all the way through &#39;em once, and now I&#39;m back toJackie.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 And I love her.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 So, how&#39;d it go, baby? - Oh.
 <br>
 Great.
 <br>
 - Cool.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Oh, except for when I crashed your van.
 <br>
 But other than that, cool.
 <br>
 How did this happen? Jackie, how? - Michael, like I said- - How? - Coming out of the drive- - [Screams] How? Kelso.
 <br>
 Come on, man.
 <br>
 Relax.
 <br>
 Let those of us who aren&#39;t you enjoy this moment.
 <br>
 Besides, it&#39;s not all that bad.
 <br>
 This door still works.
 <br>
 Hey, Jackie.
 <br>
 What happened to the other door? Other door? Yeah, you know, the thing that always got in the way of this giant, gaping hole.
 <br>
 Jackie, what are these? Uh- Van sticks.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Jackie, these- these are not van sticks.
 <br>
 These are drumsticks.
 <br>
 Whose drumsticks are they? Oh, wow, Jackie.
 <br>
 What&#39;s up? Okay.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You know what? I used your van to drive Chip and his band to a gig.
 <br>
 Jackie is Chip a girl? Uh, no.
 <br>
 You had other guys in my van? You&#39;re dating a band? It wasn&#39;t a date.
 <br>
 It was a gig.
 <br>
 Whatever it was, it was a gross misuse of van.
 <br>
 And, uh-And you owe me money- big-time! I owe you money? What about all the stuff I bought you while we were together? That does not count.
 <br>
 You gave me those things so I would love you.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Look what I&#39;ve got.
 <br>
 Ew.
 <br>
 What&#39;s that? That is Marissa.
 <br>
 Carol&#39;s baby.
 <br>
 And you promised me last night that you&#39;d babysit her.
 <br>
 Last night? But I was drunk.
 <br>
 Why can&#39;t you do it? - Because you promised.
 <br>
 - [Scoffs] - And besides- - [Cooing] Your father and I are having fondue and Parcheesi at the Pinciottis&#39;.
 <br>
 Oh? Then I&#39;ll do it.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Laurie can watch this baby tonight.
 <br>
 Oh, golly, Laurie, a baby.
 <br>
 And just in time for your Black Mass.
 <br>
 Hey.
 <br>
 What did I tell you about calling your sister the devil? That it&#39;s offensive to the devil? No, Laurie.
 <br>
 You can&#39;t feed a baby bacon.
 <br>
 Okay, okay.
 <br>
 What color is the baby? Well, good.
 <br>
 Now, if that changes, call me.
 <br>
 - Is everything okay? - Oh, yes.
 <br>
 We have just got the cutest little baby over at our house right now.
 <br>
 - Isn&#39;t she cute, Red? - Yeah, I just can&#39;t get over it.
 <br>
 Geez, Bob.
 <br>
 You got your fingers in the cheese.
 <br>
 Remember how cute Laurie and Eric were when they were babies? They used to just laugh and play.
 <br>
 Well, every time I was around all they did was scream.
 <br>
 I just think it would be nice to have a baby around the house again.
 <br>
 Oh, damn it, Bob.
 <br>
 Get your fingers out of the cheese.
 <br>
 [Groaning] [Groans] [Groans] Do you think it would still do this if I stopped feeding it? - Oh, Laurie, let me do that.
 <br>
 - [Cooing] [Cooing] Wow.
 <br>
 How&#39;d you do that last move? It&#39;s all in the wrist.
 <br>
 See? Hey.
 <br>
 - Look at the wrist on my girl.
 <br>
 - Shut up.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Wait, no.
 <br>
 Donna, wait.
 <br>
 I think it really likes you.
 <br>
 Ooh.
 <br>
 I think it just said your name.
 <br>
 [Mimicking Baby Voice] Donna! Hey, you know, you were really good in there.
 <br>
 Well, it&#39;s not exactly brain surgery.
 <br>
 I know, but it was so cool.
 <br>
 It&#39;s just- I think it&#39;s really, really cool that you can do that.
 <br>
 Eric, you&#39;re, like, over the moon &#39;cause I changed a poopy diaper, but when I got my story in the school paper all you said was, &#34;Yeah, they called you Donna Pincipotti.
 <br>
 &#34; It&#39;s a funny sound.
 <br>
 &#34;Potti.
 <br>
 &#34; Come on.
 <br>
 Try not to laugh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s good.
 <br>
 Come on, Donna.
 <br>
 About the diaper thing- I was just paying you a compliment.
 <br>
 - What was the compliment? - That you are gonna be so great staying home with our kids.
 <br>
 What? Eric, how exactly do you see our future? Okay, okay.
 <br>
 That could work.
 <br>
 I would just like to adjust one little thing.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 The businesswoman idea is good.
 <br>
 But what about this? [Disco] Okay.
 <br>
 Uh-huh.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 I would just change one thing.
 <br>
 [Disco] [Continues] That seems more hurtful than sexy.
 <br>
 Jackass.
 <br>
 So does that.
 <br>
 - You owe me money.
 <br>
 - Michael, your uncle gave you that van for free.
 <br>
 Yeah? Well, I put a lot of money into that van.
 <br>
 The shag carpeting uh, eight track strobe light, black light, red light.
 <br>
 - I hate you.
 <br>
 - Well, I hate you more.
 <br>
 - I hate you most.
 <br>
 - Well, I hate you the- Damn it! All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just act like adults and treat this like what it really is: A divorce.
 <br>
 Oh, Jackie, you get custody of me.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just figure out what you guys owe each other.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not afraid.
 <br>
 I&#39;m right, and he&#39;s a total moocher.
 <br>
 I&#39;m not afraid either.
 <br>
 There are laws to protect a man and his van.
 <br>
 For instance, the Man-Van Act of 1847.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Jackie in your opinion, what are the goods and services that Kelso owes you for? Everything.
 <br>
 He was a total doofus before I met him.
 <br>
 In fact, I bought you that belt.
 <br>
 So hand it over.
 <br>
 And the shirt too.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You know, this shirt has bad memories of you buying me stuff anyway.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Let me do the math.
 <br>
 [Clears Throat] Okay.
 <br>
 Now, Kelso- Uh, Kelso owes Jackie the price for breaking her beautiful heart and stealing her innocence.
 <br>
 Now, Kelso, what do you believe Jackie owes you? Well- Uh- W- One time I told her that she looked pretty when really she looked pretty skanky.
 <br>
 And- And- Hyde, help me out here.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Let me think.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t forget he burned your house.
 <br>
 - Hyde.
 <br>
 - Dude, you burned her house.
 <br>
 Oh, and that clean baby smell.
 <br>
 Yes, but when we had babies we couldn&#39;t go to the movies or out to dinner.
 <br>
 Oh, Red.
 <br>
 When was the last time we went to the movies or out to dinner? Exactly.
 <br>
 Who needs to leave the house when there are no babies in it? I gotta thank my lucky stars I got the old snippety-snip.
 <br>
 Bob, you mean you just let some quack remove- On, no.
 <br>
 Nothing&#39;s removed.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s enough of that.
 <br>
 Yeah, well, I guess it&#39;s okay if it means you don&#39;t have to have any more babies.
 <br>
 Oh, Red, it was fun having babies.
 <br>
 Remember fun? Yes, Kitty, but it was also a large responsibility.
 <br>
 Or burden, if you will.
 <br>
 Red Forman, I don&#39;t want to hear another word out of you unless it&#39;s &#34;I love babies.
 <br>
 &#34; - Kitty, you&#39;re making a scene.
 <br>
 - That is not &#34;I love babies.
 <br>
 &#34; Kitty, what&#39;s the matter with you? Oh, well, l- I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t want to ruin our nice night out because, boy, Midge, you can really melt a super pot of cheese, but, um- I think I want another baby.
 <br>
 Really? You like my cheese? This is Aqua Net.
 <br>
 The same stuff Farrah uses.
 <br>
 And she&#39;s got a big TV show, and she&#39;s married to Lee Majors.
 <br>
 So, Aqua Net, very important.
 <br>
 Oh, come on, Red.
 <br>
 Oh, look how sweet this baby is.
 <br>
 Just hold it.
 <br>
 Look, Kitty.
 <br>
 I didn&#39;t touch our kids when they were babies, and I&#39;m not touching this one.
 <br>
 - Red Forman, you touch this baby.
 <br>
 - Nope.
 <br>
 - Touch it.
 <br>
 - Not happening.
 <br>
 Is this child wearing lip liner? So, turns out my supersensitive guy boyfriend wants me to be a baby machine.
 <br>
 [Scoffs] What a dill-hole.
 <br>
 Donna, I&#39;m sitting right here.
 <br>
 That&#39;s why I said it, you dill-hole.
 <br>
 Donna, the only reason I thought you&#39;d stay home with the babies is because only every woman has done it for the entire history of time.
 <br>
 So, don&#39;t be mad at me.
 <br>
 Be mad at your foremothers.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 That is so typical.
 <br>
 As if every woman wants to spend her life as a pampered housewife raising kids and organizing the help.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Isn&#39;t that what every woman wants? Donna, man Forman&#39;s just limited by his experiences.
 <br>
 As the voice of a new generation of smart, independent women you need to make this dill-hole realize that a mind and spirit like yours has more options than your mothers had.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 Sorry.
 <br>
 What? All right, Donna.
 <br>
 So are we cool? I&#39;m not wrong.
 <br>
 Women take care of babies.
 <br>
 - They do.
 <br>
 - Listen to him, Marissa.
 <br>
 He whines like a girl, but he&#39;s not a girl.
 <br>
 Or maybe he is.
 <br>
 The thing is, Donna&#39;s really good at it.
 <br>
 I mean, I could understand you not wanting to stay home with your children.
 <br>
 You already have such a fulfilling career as a whore.
 <br>
 Listen, twerp.
 <br>
 Did you ever think maybe it&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t want to have babies? Maybe she just doesn&#39;t want to have your skinny, whiny girl-trapped-in-a-boy-body babies.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 That&#39;s one for you.
 <br>
 I&#39;m cold.
 <br>
 That must be why your nipples are so pointy.
 <br>
 Oh, pointy nipple man is mad.
 <br>
 I hope he doesn&#39;t poke me with his pointy nipples.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 That was really disturbing.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Here we go.
 <br>
 According to my calculations, for repairs to the van Jackie, you owe Kelso $65.
 <br>
 Aha! Justice! Yeah.
 <br>
 And, Kelso, you oweJackie $8,265.
 <br>
 Pay up, moocher! Wha-Wha- No, no.
 <br>
 This is- That&#39;s totally unfair! Hyde, you suck.
 <br>
 You could have been a man and forgiven her.
 <br>
 But no.
 <br>
 You wanted to do the math.
 <br>
 Man, math has never been my friend.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 But she had other guys in my van.
 <br>
 Michael, you had other girls in your van while we were dating.
 <br>
 So, give me my $8,000.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I change my mind.
 <br>
 I forgive you.
 <br>
 See, if we had a baby right now we could be giving it a bath.
 <br>
 We could be putting it in its warm little jammies.
 <br>
 Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a shame that we have to crawl into bed for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep instead.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t really want another baby.
 <br>
 Well, I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 I only have a few years left where I even have the option.
 <br>
 Well, just because you can have a baby doesn&#39;t mean you should.
 <br>
 I have a snowblower, but I don&#39;t use it in July.
 <br>
 Red, it just- It feels like maybe we&#39;ve done everything important there is to do.
 <br>
 We saved up.
 <br>
 We got our house.
 <br>
 We had our kids.
 <br>
 Now what&#39;s left to look forward to? Peace and quiet.
 <br>
 [Baby Crying] Well I just can&#39;t believe we&#39;re never gonna hear that sound in our house again.
 <br>
 Well, until we have grandchildren.
 <br>
 Grandchildren! Oh, I forgot about grandchildren! - [Door Closes] - So did I.
 <br>
 [Laughing] Oh, boy.
 <br>
 I like the looks of that.
 <br>
 My baby with a baby.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not that hard.
 <br>
 I heard her crying, and I figured she needed a bottle and it turned out that she did.
 <br>
 So, um you think you might want a baby of your own? Well, yeah.
 <br>
 I mean, once my looks start to go, why not? All right.
 <br>
 So, how many kids are we talking here? One? Two? Six? Whoa, Mom.
 <br>
 Ease up, okay? I&#39;m not even down to one boyfriend yet.
 <br>
 But- But you will be soon, right? Well, Zeke gets out of jail in three months.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 Uh, I&#39;m- I&#39;m- I&#39;m gonna go talk to Eric.
 <br>
 Mom are you happy? Sure.
 <br>
 What&#39;s this about? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 It&#39;s, like Eric said this stupid thing about me not working when we&#39;re married and I just want to do something more meaningful with my life than have kids, you know? - No offense.
 <br>
 - No.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 That&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 It&#39;s not like I never wondered what my life could have been like if I hadn&#39;t married your father.
 <br>
 I mean, l- Well, I could have been a doctor.
 <br>
 - Exactly.
 <br>
 - Or a dancing girl.
 <br>
 Right.
 <br>
 Oh, honey.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry so much about what Eric said.
 <br>
 You&#39;re probably not even gonna have to deal with this anyway.
 <br>
 - How do you figure that? - Well, you and Eric are so young.
 <br>
 The chances are you&#39;re not gonna end up together anyway.
 <br>
 All right, Donna.
 <br>
 That&#39;s it.
 <br>
 We gotta figure this out.
 <br>
 Because this is just hanging over our heads like one of those huge, awful hanging things.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s not worry about this anymore.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s, uh- Let&#39;s go for a drive, okay? Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;m sorry.
 <br>
 Did you want to say something else? No.
 <br>
 Just I love you.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 - Enough to strip for me? - All right.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 I mean I love you too.
 <br>
 I&#39;d strip for you.
 <br>
 Laurie, her mother is waiting.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t care.
 <br>
 I love her, and I&#39;m not giving her back! - What are you doing with that? - Give me back the baby, missy, or, so help me the dryer goes down.
 <br>
 - You wouldn&#39;t.
 <br>
 - I would.
 <br>
 Fine, fine.
 <br>
 Take her.
 <br>
 [Coos] Shh, baby.
 <br>
 You&#39;re okay now.
 <br>
 <br>
