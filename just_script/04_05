 ( Coughs, Sniffs ) Steven, it&#39;s 7-damn-30 in the morning.
 <br>
 What the hell are you doing here? Red, be nice.
 <br>
 Steven, we&#39;re waiting.
 <br>
 Oh, I&#39;ve been living in the basement.
 <br>
 You know, I did notice a dusting of curly hair on the floor but I just wrote it off to my changing teenage body.
 <br>
 I moved back in when my dad got transferred.
 <br>
 Transferred? He&#39;s a bartender.
 <br>
 Where&#39;d he get transferred to, the jukebox? You know, Red, if it&#39;s cool, I&#39;d kinda rather not talk about it.
 <br>
 Well, Steven, it&#39;s important to get these things out in the open.
 <br>
 Kitty, let him do what&#39;s natural and keep his feelings bottled up.
 <br>
 Attaboy.
 <br>
 Well- ( Kisses ) welcome back, Steven.
 <br>
 You know, maybe we can spruce up your old room since I decided to redo the basement.
 <br>
 What? You&#39;re redoing the basement? Well, honey, no one uses it.
 <br>
 I use it.
 <br>
 Every day.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my Batcave.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll find you a good, cheap contractor.
 <br>
 Oh, no, no, no.
 <br>
 This is something I want to handle myself.
 <br>
 - This is going to be expensive, isn&#39;t it? - Maybe.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you like anything cheap? I like you.
 <br>
 Hangin&#39;out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We&#39;re all all right We&#39;re all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
 <br>
 ! Yeah, I&#39;m gonna miss it down here.
 <br>
 A lot of good times.
 <br>
 I broke my foot climbing out of this dryer.
 <br>
 Yeah, I hit my head playing handball with the soap in that shower.
 <br>
 Me and Jackie totally did it, like, a bajillion times on this old sofa.
 <br>
 Michael, that&#39;s private.
 <br>
 I got news for you.
 <br>
 It wasn&#39;t that private.
 <br>
 Oh, my God! That is the biggest spider I have ever seen.
 <br>
 I think it had a rat in its mouth.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) Okay, I think maybe the basement isn&#39;t the place for me after all.
 <br>
 Oh, you know what, Mom? I think you might be right.
 <br>
 I mean, not only is it bug-infested, but in all honesty I think it might be haunted.
 <br>
 ( Deep Voice ) Get out.
 <br>
 That&#39;s spooky.
 <br>
 I don&#39;t know, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman.
 <br>
 I mean, sure, it&#39;s a pit now but if you paint, fumigate and get rid of Eric, this could be a great room.
 <br>
 Hey, wh- Hey, okay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re not my girlfriend anymore.
 <br>
 Okay? So you don&#39;t get an opinion on my stuff now.
 <br>
 Mom, don&#39;t listen to her.
 <br>
 She&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 Wait, I disagree with you, so I&#39;m crazy? I think the last time I disagreed with you was the sanest thing I ever did.
 <br>
 Okay, are you referring to our breakup? Because I must remind everyone that she wore my promise ring around her neck.
 <br>
 That&#39;s crazy.
 <br>
 Ring, finger.
 <br>
 Finger, ring.
 <br>
 - Well, you&#39;re lucky I didn&#39;t shove the ring up your ass.
 <br>
 - Mom! All right.
 <br>
 Wait.
 <br>
 Who said, &#39;&#39;Get out&#39;&#39;? Anyway, Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, we have a bunch of decorating magazines at home.
 <br>
 - I&#39;ll bring &#39;em over.
 <br>
 - Well, thank you, Donna.
 <br>
 And I think that ring looked nice around your neck.
 <br>
 Donna, what the hell? What, we&#39;re not going out anymore so you don&#39;t like my basement? Well, I guess now that I&#39;m an ex-girlfriend I&#39;m free to tell the truth.
 <br>
 Free at last! Free at last! Whoo! - Michael, get Eric some ice.
 <br>
 - Why? For that wicked burn! Burn, Eric! Burn! Oh, happy day.
 <br>
 Your friend Fez has taken his love of dance to its logical conclusion.
 <br>
 I have joined a ballet class.
 <br>
 Man, no offense, but you&#39;re, like, one good cry away from being the total woman.
 <br>
 Oh, really? Well, would a total woman have her own pink satin slippers? Oh, Red, here.
 <br>
 Um, meet our contractors.
 <br>
 This is Theo and- Hey, Mr.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s Dad.
 <br>
 This is who you hired to redo our basement? Well, no, no.
 <br>
 Actually, I hired Theo.
 <br>
 And, uh, I didn&#39;t really expect Leo.
 <br>
 That was, um- That was a bonus.
 <br>
 Here.
 <br>
 Shoo, Leo.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t worry, ma&#39;am.
 <br>
 Leo is solid.
 <br>
 And he&#39;s not allowed to touch anything electrical.
 <br>
 Kitty, I hate to interfere- I understand your concern, sir.
 <br>
 But I&#39;m not an irresponsible screwup like my cousin Leo.
 <br>
 That&#39;s true, man.
 <br>
 I used to be like Leo, sitting around all day, wasting my life.
 <br>
 But then one day the smoke cleared.
 <br>
 See, Red? He had an epiphany.
 <br>
 Actually, I ran out of weed, and the smoke cleared.
 <br>
 But, uh- ( Chuckles ) then I saw how trashed my apartment was, so I rebuilt it.
 <br>
 Been a contractor ever since.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m sold.
 <br>
 Okay, Donna, when did you stop liking my basement? I never liked it.
 <br>
 There were a lot of things I kept to myself when we were dating.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) Yeah, well there were plenty of things I kept to myself.
 <br>
 Plenty.
 <br>
 Like what, for instance? I&#39;m sure Donna would like to know.
 <br>
 Yeah, like what, for instance? Well, like- ( Scoffs ) why don&#39;t you just start first? Okay.
 <br>
 You know how when you eat, and you smack your lips in that really cute way? Yeah.
 <br>
 It&#39;s disgusting.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) That&#39;s all you got? No.
 <br>
 You have tiny wrists.
 <br>
 What? No, I don&#39;t.
 <br>
 Mom, do I have tiny wrists? No, not tiny.
 <br>
 Dainty.
 <br>
 No, no, no.
 <br>
 No, no.
 <br>
 The doctor always said you were in the normal range.
 <br>
 See? Normal, Big Bone Magoo.
 <br>
 Ooh.
 <br>
 That&#39;s nice.
 <br>
 You don&#39;t have to tell me.
 <br>
 It&#39;s really cool you&#39;re here.
 <br>
 Most men won&#39;t take ballet class.
 <br>
 Oh, my pet, most men are not Fez.
 <br>
 ( Siren Wailing In Distance ) This whole basement thing is Donna&#39;s fault.
 <br>
 I mean, what&#39;s her problem? She&#39;s been messing with me all day.
 <br>
 - It could be payback.
 <br>
 - For what? Well, she had to see you naked for two years.
 <br>
 That must&#39;ve been unpleasant.
 <br>
 You know, for a guy who&#39;s been orphaned twice, you really lack compassion.
 <br>
 Speaking of hurtful things- Hey, where&#39;s your dad, man? ( Coughs ) Okay.
 <br>
 He, uh- He went to work for the police developing high-tech handcuffs to restrain people with tiny wrists.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, puffy-shirt guy called.
 <br>
 He wants his puffy shirt back.
 <br>
 Things at ballet class have taken a turn for the worse.
 <br>
 Somehow, I&#39;ve become one of the girls- a hairy, brown girl.
 <br>
 Hey, uh, Fez does that shirt come with its own bicycle pump? You should talk.
 <br>
 That shirt makes you look like a stick of Fruit Stripe gum.
 <br>
 God, what did you have for breakfast this morning Carnation Instant Bitch? Okay, that one was out of the park.
 <br>
 ( Groans ) I am so bored with you two.
 <br>
 You know what? I actually want to talk about Fez.
 <br>
 Fez, why don&#39;t the women at ballet love you? I don&#39;t know.
 <br>
 They let me touch their thighs but not their hearts.
 <br>
 You know what might help? If you dressed a little more masculine.
 <br>
 Hey, Hyde, you know what my favorite ballet is? The Nutcracker? Hey, guys.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time to knock off? You know, maybe forever? Yeah, well, we&#39;re not done yet.
 <br>
 Don&#39;t let us get in your way.
 <br>
 Do whatever you&#39;d normally do.
 <br>
 This is what you normally do? I used to do this, too, back when I was being an artist.
 <br>
 I love art.
 <br>
 But I hate work.
 <br>
 But I love art.
 <br>
 But I hate work.
 <br>
 Do you hear that, Forman? Theo&#39;s an artist who hates work and who at this moment is very open to suggestion.
 <br>
 Oh.
 <br>
 I gotcha, Hyde.
 <br>
 Theo, cluck like a chicken.
 <br>
 Do it.
 <br>
 Ow! Oh.
 <br>
 Theo, if you&#39;re unhappy, and I hope you are you gotta be true to yourself.
 <br>
 Give up construction, man.
 <br>
 Go back to art.
 <br>
 You broke up with Art? I don&#39;t know what Eric&#39;s problem is.
 <br>
 I wasn&#39;t being a bitch, was I? Oh.
 <br>
 Donna, I know from bitch, and yes-yes, you were.
 <br>
 But I feel much closer to you now.
 <br>
 All right.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I know what&#39;s going on here.
 <br>
 You&#39;re being mean to Eric because you wanna do it with him.
 <br>
 When Jackie dumped me, I had a buttload of leftover &#39;&#39;wanting to do it with her&#39;&#39; feelings.
 <br>
 Oh, my God.
 <br>
 You morons might be right.
 <br>
 But why do I have these stupid feelings left over? I just want to be friends with him now.
 <br>
 ( Chuckles ) What a child.
 <br>
 So innocent.
 <br>
 You&#39;re never gonna be friends with him.
 <br>
 The only reason he was friends with you was so he could do it with you.
 <br>
 Really? So he made friends with me when I was five so he could do it with me when I was 1 7? Well, that and your sweet Big Wheel.
 <br>
 Okay, off to ballet class now.
 <br>
 More masculine, yes? Okay.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all done.
 <br>
 But you&#39;ve only been here a day.
 <br>
 Well, you know what they say: Rome was built in a day.
 <br>
 No.
 <br>
 Uh, &#39;&#39;Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; Oh? Well, your basement was built in a day.
 <br>
 Ta-da.
 <br>
 Y-You didn&#39;t do anything.
 <br>
 It&#39;s a commentary.
 <br>
 See, you wanted to change your basement into something that it wasn&#39;t.
 <br>
 So instead of giving you something that you thought you wanted I gave you something that you needed.
 <br>
 Red, I think my contractor&#39;s on dope.
 <br>
 No need to thank me.
 <br>
 Oh, we won&#39;t.
 <br>
 Because you didn&#39;t do anything, hophead.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Look! It&#39;s art! I moved everything in this basement two inches to the left.
 <br>
 Oh, yeah.
 <br>
 I call it &#39;&#39;Basement- Two Inches to the Left.
 <br>
 &#39;&#39; It&#39;s wild, huh? I mean, it&#39;s like- Where are you? All right.
 <br>
 Mrs.
 <br>
 Eric&#39;s Mother would like you to leave now.
 <br>
 Okay, you don&#39;t get it.
 <br>
 But when your life shifts two inches to the left you&#39;re gonna call me.
 <br>
 Oh, yes.
 <br>
 You are gonna call me.
 <br>
 ! And if you like our work, tell your friends, okay? ( Eric ) Well, well, well.
 <br>
 - Look who finally got his basement back.
 <br>
 - Yep.
 <br>
 Outwitted two hippie burnouts.
 <br>
 - Walk tall.
 <br>
 - ( Clicks On ) ( TV: Crowd Cheering ) So, hey, Hyde.
 <br>
 Come on.
 <br>
 Where&#39;s your dad? Really.
 <br>
 Fine.
 <br>
 You want to know? He and my mom got back together.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 No way.
 <br>
 That&#39;s great.
 <br>
 So, where are they? I can&#39;t tell you.
 <br>
 - Why not? - &#39;Cause they won&#39;t tell me.
 <br>
 They split on you? Oh, man.
 <br>
 Oh, man.
 <br>
 See, this is why I didn&#39;t wanna tell you.
 <br>
 I knew you&#39;d get all After School Special on me.
 <br>
 Me? ( Laughs ) Please.
 <br>
 It&#39;s okay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re home now.
 <br>
 - Get off me, man.
 <br>
 - No, you let me love you, orphan boy! Don&#39;t hide from your feelings! - So, hey.
 <br>
 - Hey.
 <br>
 Look, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been so- Bitchy? Yeah, I hadn&#39;t noticed.
 <br>
 Who said &#39;&#39;bitchy&#39;&#39;? Yeah, well, it turns out that there are some lingering feelings or something.
 <br>
 Not real feelings- just, like, lingering urges.
 <br>
 But they&#39;re just lingering feelings.
 <br>
 They&#39;re not actual feelings.
 <br>
 I just wanna make that very clear.
 <br>
 You have.
 <br>
 By using the word &#39;&#39;lingering,&#39;&#39; like, six times.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 And the basement&#39;s actually really cool.
 <br>
 And your wrists are very wide.
 <br>
 - ( Exhales ) - Hmm.
 <br>
 Um, there must be some way to break the tension here.
 <br>
 Oh, I know.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s just have sex.
 <br>
 - Okay.
 <br>
 - Really? No.
 <br>
 See ya.
 <br>
 ( Scoffs ) Like I wanted to.
 <br>
 I did want to.
 <br>
