 Eric! ERIC! Donna, this is a tricky maneuver okay, I need quiet.
 <br>
 Oh my God! It&#39;s the cops! Eric! We&#39;re completely NAKED! - Don&#39;t panick! I uhh have a plan.
 <br>
 - Okay Go away! That&#39;s the plan?! That&#39;s NOT a good plan! Yeah, no, that&#39;s the plan.
 <br>
 I mean, we&#39;re totally naked, I think he&#39;ll probably just go away.
 <br>
 Crap.
 <br>
 Have you seen my pants? - Where are you going? - Out.
 <br>
 Where? A place.
 <br>
 Who with? Doctors and stockbrokers.
 <br>
 Oh holy hell! And and and the heater is broken in the VistaCruiser, that&#39;s why it was so hot so uh naturally we removed one or two articles of clothing which you know in retrospect was probably not that good an idea Eric, how stupid do you think I am? You&#39;re right, should&#39;ve cracked a window, good thinking.
 <br>
 Eric, we know what you were doing in the car.
 <br>
 No, we don&#39;t &#39;know&#39;.
 <br>
 Trust me, we know.
 <br>
 No, no, we don&#39;t &#39;know&#39;! I know! I know! Course you know, you majored in it.
 <br>
 What were you thinking? Mr.
 <br>
 Forman uhh it was my idea too.
 <br>
 So uhm, please stop yelling at Eric? Because What?! Just play dead and cover your face.
 <br>
 No Eric, it&#39;s okay What we did was a choice that we made.
 <br>
 A choice we made as adults.
 <br>
 - Oh really.
 <br>
 You&#39;re an adult? - Don&#39;t answer! It&#39;s a trap.
 <br>
 Yes.
 <br>
 We&#39;re adults.
 <br>
 Okay Donna, then as an adult I expect you to go next door and tell Bob and Midge just exactly what happened tonight.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell them.
 <br>
 Good.
 <br>
 And I&#39;m gonna check to see that you did.
 <br>
 Oh come on! Why would you do that?! Donna I won&#39;t keep something like this from your parents.
 <br>
 They think we&#39;re friends.
 <br>
 Hey cool man, a CB radio! Yeah! So I narrowed down my potential CB handles to two choices, either Stud Kickass or Flex BuffChest.
 <br>
 Gee Kelso, what about Beef Dingleberry? Great, now I&#39;ve got three choices Radio crackles(female voices): Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, this is Hot-To-Trot, Foxy-Lady and Nice-And-Easy Oh my God, they sound nice! And easy! Quick, come on we need handles so we can talk to &#39;m.

 <br>
 Okay, then what is my macho cop-handle? Julie! Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, this is Pete I&#39;m Linc And Julie.
 <br>
 It is so nice to talk to you my lovelies.
 <br>
 Hot-To-Trot: Hey Julie, cool accent! You sound sexy.
 <br>
 Accent? What the hell is she talking about? - Something on your mind? - Yeah.
 <br>
 There is something important I want to tell you guys.
 <br>
 Eric and I have been  going out for a while now and we did something you two should know about.
 <br>
 Yes? Well see, Eric and I, uhm we uhm we rode the Forman&#39;s motorcycle! There! I said it! Weight is just off my shoulders.
 <br>
 Donna, that was wrong.
 <br>
 But not a wrong as it could have been, cause it could have been Sex! That&#39;s what I thought too! What?! No, that&#39;s crazy,that&#39;s that&#39;s silly, you guys are silly gooses! You make me laugh, cause you&#39;re silly! So the cops caught you doing it? Oh my God! That is SUCH a turn on! That is NOT a turn on! You&#39;re a little pervert! Jackie, I have a big problem.
 <br>
 How am I gonna tell my parents? Okay, if you need to use the bathroom, you should go now.
 <br>
 Cause I have a lot to say.
 <br>
 No, I&#39;m fine thanks.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 You&#39;re first mistake, was wearing pants for car-sex.
 <br>
 When you do it in the car, skirts are your best friend! Zip-zap, bim-bam, you&#39;re done, you&#39;re dressed, you&#39;re back at the mall! Jackie, I&#39;m screwed! If I tell my parents, only one of two things could happen.
 <br>
 Either they&#39;ll be furious, or they&#39;ll ask me how it was.
 <br>
 Here now, have some peas I&#39;d rather have sexwith Donna.
 <br>
 Mmmmmm tapioca! Hmmmm sex with Donna! Oh you, you are just so cute.
 <br>
 Ahahahha! Say Ma-Ma! Sex with Don-Na! - No baby no! - Yes! - No! - Yes! - NO! No! YES! NO NO NO NO Kitty! Slut! What? Nothing.
 <br>
 Are you okay? I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Kitty, when it&#39;s three o&#39;clock on a saturday afternoon and you&#39;re still in bed, I know something is wrong.
 <br>
 Oh Red I&#39;m fine.
 <br>
 Why should I care that my sweet babyboy was defiled by some jiggly red-haired tramp? Kitty! What I can&#39;t figure out is how she tricked him into it.
 <br>
 Look it&#39;s not like we didn&#39;t know this was coming.
 <br>
 You&#39;re always showing Eric anatomical diagrams and charts and slides.
 <br>
 You&#39;ve been prepping him since he was six! Are you blaming me?! No no, heck no.
 <br>
 It&#39;s my fault.
 <br>
 Men are dirty.
 <br>
 Well good.
 <br>
 Kitty I just want you to get out of bed.
 <br>
 You know, none of us had lunch and uhm we&#39;re kinda hungry Well, it&#39;s a house full of grown men and I would think that one of you FULLY grown men would know how to make a damn sandwich! Well maybe I should go I sure as hell would! And when Bob and Midge look at me with their big dumb eyes, I just I can&#39;t find the words.
 <br>
 Okay Donna, I&#39;ve given this a lot of thought, and I think I should be the one to tell your parents we had sex.
 <br>
 Oh my God, Eric that is so great! Thank you! What? No no! What? No! It was a bluff! I was bluffing.
 <br>
 .
 <br>

 <br>
 Oh crap this is a nightmare.
 <br>
 Fine, I&#39;ll do it myself.
 <br>
 What? No, wait.

 <br>
 HOT-TO-TROT: Well, why don&#39;t you guys come see for yourselves? We could meet tonight.
 <br>
 Oh tonight? No tonight we have to watch Love Boat so I don&#39;t think As soon as I heard you were down Mrs.
 <br>
 Forman, I had to come and see you.
 <br>
 Because I know the blues.
 <br>
 But you know, the good news is, Donna is on the pill.
 <br>
 So, they can do it like a zillion times a day and nothing bad can happen.
 <br>
 Yeah, they can just do it and do it and do it and do it and do it! JACKIE! Good you&#39;re here.
 <br>

 <br>
 You think maybe it&#39;s time to get up? No.
 <br>

 <br>
 Pinciotti, it&#39;s something I need to tell you Sorry, I almost threw up I&#39;m fine now.
 <br>
 You both know how much I respect your daughter, how much I love your daughter, and uhm, funny thing about love, haha, is uhm sometimes, we express it in a physical way.
 <br>
 You better not say what I think you&#39;re gonna say.
 <br>
 Cause I&#39;ll be mad.
 <br>
 And funny thing about mad, haha, is sometimes I express it in a physical way.
 <br>
 I love your daughter and I totally respect her, and I never stopped respecting her.
 <br>
 Even when the cops came.
 <br>
 Well I&#39;m sorry Eric.
 <br>
 But I still gotta twist your neck shut! Dad! You know you shouldn&#39;t be threathening Eric.
 <br>
 You should be uhm thanking him.
 <br>
 What?! Wow! He&#39;s treated me like a queen since the day we started dating.
 <br>
 Eric and I have sex.
 <br>
 There.
 <br>
 You know.
 <br>
 At least I have a nice boyfriend and not some juvenile delinquent.
 <br>
 Like that Fonzie! Well that&#39;snice.
 <br>
 And at least Eric had the guts to come over here and tell you man to man.
 <br>
 Well, I&#39;m happy for you.
 <br>
 And thank you for being honest.
 <br>
 That took a lot of courage, didn&#39;t it Bob? I&#39;m going to bed! So - How was it? - OH GOD! Boy oh boy.
 <br>
 I&#39;ll tell you Eric, you take the cake.
 <br>
 Oh man, there is cake?! There&#39;s no cake.
 <br>
 We&#39;re all starving to death and it&#39;s all your fault.
 <br>
 You broke your mothers heart! She&#39;s up there crying about how you&#39;re all grown up and you don&#39;t need her anymore.
 <br>
 Butthat&#39;s not true.
 <br>
 Well I know that.
 <br>
 You&#39;re a helpless idiot.
 <br>
 Ah.
 <br>
 Okay.
 <br>
 I could pretend to need help with my homework.
 <br>
 No no no-one gives a crap about that.
 <br>
 Oh! I could pretend to be sick.
 <br>
 No thatWait a minute, that might work.
 <br>
 She mothered the heck out of you when you broke your leg that time.
 <br>
 Right, I could say I have a fever.
 <br>
 Or better yet, we could walk to the garage, I hit you in the elbow with a baseball bat! I&#39;m gonna stick with the fever.
 <br>
 If you wanna go through life doing everything half-assed, that&#39;s your decision son.
 <br>
 Okay! They said they&#39;d wait out front.
 <br>
 Here we go, cold beer and hot babes! Or vice-versa! Hey guys, did we get a yes or a no on the fat question? Oh goody, they&#39;re not fat, they&#39;re just old! If your voice is hot, then you should be hot, those are the RULES! Damn old ladies with hot voices.
 <br>
 Let&#39;s go No no, I&#39;m staying.
 <br>
 You two are shallow! I&#39;m not shallow Fez, I just judge chicks on their looks.
 <br>
 Suit yourself, but sometimes the old ones are super grateful.
